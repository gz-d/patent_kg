A single-phase or multi-phase synchro- nous rectifier can comprise at least a first pair of switches of a first conducting path and a second pair of switches of a second conducting path that can form or emulate a diode bridge. To facilitate emulating turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, a switch can be turned on when voltage across the switch is forward-biased and turned off when switch current is reversed; also, there can be at least one current-controlled switch in each conducting path. Self-driven gate-drive cir- cuitry employs low power components that can facilitate controlling respective switching of the at least first pair and second pair of switches, wherein switching of the switches is also controlled at to emulate diode\n\n(51) Int.

To cope with different types of load, that synchronous rectifier circuit can \u00a2 initially inactivated in order to allow the body-diodes of the 6 MOSFETs to conduct like a normal 3-phase diode rectifier. Using timing circuits, the conduction periods of the MOS- FETs\u2019 bode diodes are then registered. Such conduction time information is then used to control the conduction time of the MOSFETS. However, this approach has at least three major imitations. First, with the use of voltage detection only, the logic circuits have to be tailor-made to cater for a particular application. Second, since a diode will turn off only when its current is reversed and has gone through the reverse-recovery rocess using voltage detection cannot guarantee equivalent diode bridge rectification functions under all types of loads and circumstances. Third, a DC power supply derived from the AC voltage supply is desired to power the control elec- tronics. While a DC power supply for the control circuitry can derived from the input AC voltage source with the aid of isolation transformers, transformers cannot be easily inte- grated into the same package with the MOSFETs in a com- act way, and as a result, the control circuitry with the trans- formers will take up significant space and cannot be built in the same package with the MOSFETs, and as further result, will not be able to form a replacement block for a diode\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELAIED APPLICATION AND CLAIM FOR PRIORITY\n\nThis application is a non-provisional of and claims the benefit of, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/304, 097, filed Feb. 12, 2010, and titled \u201cCONTROL CIRCUITS FOR SELF-DRIVEN SYNCHRONOUS RECTIFIER AS ENERGY-EFFICIENT REPLACEMENT FOR DIODE RECTIFIER\u201d, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\nThe subject disclosure relates generally to electronic cir- cuitry, and in particular, to systems, methodologies, and devices that can provide a self-driven AC-DC synchronous rectifier that can be used, for example, in power applications.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nreplace diodes for reducing conduction losses, have been used in low-voltage and high-current applications. Synchro- nous rectifier techniques are primarily applied to various versions of DC-DC converters such as buck converters, fly- back converters, boost-buck converters, half-bridge convert- ers, and LCC resonant converters. To reduce the cost of the gate drive circuits, self-driven techniques have been an active research topic in synchronous rectifiers, although a gate con- trol integrated circuit for driving synchronous rectifiers is also commercially available. Other research aspects include the use of soft-switching techniques. Besides DC-DC converters, synchronous rectification techniques have been applied to three-phase full-bridge AC-DC converter based on a three- phase fully-controlled bridge and even to a five-level con- verter. While the self-driven technique uses the changing voltage polarity of the coupled windings to control the switching of the power MOSFETs, other techniques tend to use control integrated circuits to provide the gating signals. Another conventional approach replaces a general-purpose diode bridge with synchronous rectifier for low power and low voltage (e.g., 3V to 5V) applications in which the syn- chronous rectification technique is applied to a centre-tap rectifier topology. However, in such approach, a customized charge pump circuit is needed in order to provide a suitable DC power supply for the gate drive. Also, as this approach\n\nIt is desirable to be able to provide a self-driven AC-DC synchronous rectification technique that can be used to develop an AC-DC synchronous rectifier that can behave like a diode bridge and be used in high-voltage power applica- tions, but with significantly reduced conduction losses and. without requiring control integrated circuits. It is also desir- able to be able to use such an AC-DC synchronous rectifier in single-phase and multi-phase systems.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe following presents a simplified summary of the inno- vations in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed sub- ject matter nor delineate the scope of the subject innovations. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\n\nThe disclosed subject matter relates to systems, methods, and devices that can produce or comprise a single-phase and multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) AC-DC synchronous rectifier, which includes self-driven control circuitry, for use in high- voltage power applications are presented. In an aspect, the synchronous rectifier circuitry can behave like, function as, or emulate a diode bridge (e.g., a bridge rectifier), and also can provide benefits over conventional rectifiers, wherein, for example, one benefit can be a significantly smaller conduc- tion loss as compared to a conventional diode bridge.\n\nmains frequency also has been developed and reported in U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,425. It is based on the detection of the phase- phase voltage, output voltage and timing circuits. Sophisti- cated logic and timing circuits are needed to provide the gating signals if the AC source has significant source induc- tance. However, the gating signals for synchronous rectifiers based on phase-phase and output voltages detection is not adequate because the diodes of a traditional bridge rectifier only turn off naturally after their current reverse-recovery processes. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,425, the three-phase syn- chronous rectifier circuit replaces the six diodes with power MOSFETs and uses \u201cvoltage-controlled gate drive circuits\u201d and the appropriate logic circuits to control the switching of\n\nIn an embodiment, a single-phase system can include a single-phase synchronous rectifier that can comprise a first pair of switches ofa first conducting path anda second pair of switches of a second conducting path. In an aspect, to facili- tate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, a first type of switch (e.g., a power switch, which can be a voltage-controlled self-driven (VCSD) switch) can be asso- ciated with a high-side portion of a self-driven gate-drive (SDGD) subsystem, and can be turned on (e.g., placed in or transitioned to an on state) when the voltage across such switch is forward-biased; and there can be another of\n\nSynchronous rectifiers, based on the use of power metal- oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) to\n\naims at low-voltage applications, it is not suitable for mains voltage operations.

Thus, to facilitate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of diodes in a bridge rectifier, there can be at least one current-controlled switch in each current path of the circuitry associated with the synchronous rectifier (e.g., the equivalent diode-bridge circuit). In an embodiment, one or more of the switches can be metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) (e.g., power MOSFETs), which each can have inherent body diodes.\n\nconsumes a relatively low amount of power, and can receive portion of the AC voltage source or preferably at least a portion of the rectified signal generated by the multi-phase synchronous rectifier to facilitate powering the SDGD sub- system. In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem, or at least desired portion, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can be employed to facilitate controlling respective switching of the power switches. In another aspect, the SDGD subsystem and associated power switches can be divided into two parts, which can include a high-side portion that includes three (or more) of the switches (e.g., VCSD power switches) and a high-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, and a low-side portion that includes the other three (or more) switches (e.g., CCSD power switches) and a low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, wherein the high-side portion and low-side portion of the system can be symmetrical.\n\nIn another aspect, the single-phase system can comprise an SDGD subsystem, comprising self-driven gate-drive cir- cuitry, that can be associated with (e.g., electrically connected. to) the first pair and second pair of switches to facilitate controlling respective switching of the switches. In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can be low power (e.g., can employ components using low power), wherein the power supplied to the SDGD subsystem can be provided by the AC voltage source or preferably at least a portion of the rectified output signal from the synchronous rectifier. In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem, or a desired portion thereof, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can comprise a high-side portion and a low-side portion that can be symmetrical. With the arrangement of SDGD sub- system and the switches (e.g., power MOSFETs), the syn- chronous rectifier can thereby be a self-driven synchronous rectifier. In another aspect, the switches can form and/or emulate a diode bridge. In an aspect, even if the SDGD subsystem is not ready for full or steady-state operation, for example, immediately at the start-up of the synchronous rec- tifier (or at another period of time when the SDGD subsystem is not operating at steady-state operation), the synchronous rectifier can still function the same as or substantially similar to a diode bridge (e.g., bridge-rectifier type functionality is inherent in the synchronous rectifier) because the body diodes of the MOSFETs are arranged in the circuit to form a tradi- tional diode rectifier circuit. Before the output DC voltage of the rectifier is ready to power the control circuitry for switch- ing the MOSFETs, these body diodes can facilitate enabling the MOSFETs to act as a normal diode rectifier during the start-up process. In still another aspect, the system can include a zero-cross controller component(s) that can facili- tate providing a desired positive voltage signal to a compara- tor(s) associated with a switch(es) (e.g., low-side switch) to facilitate ensuring that the associated switch(es) is in an off state at or near zero-crossing points during half-cycles of the signal. In yet another aspect, the synchronous rectifier can be employed in high-voltage power applications (e.g., 110 V or\n\ncan be situated in relation to each other to form and/or emu- late a diode bridge, which can facilitate functioning to rectify an input signal to produce a rectified signal, even when the SDGD subsystem is not operating at steady state (e.g., during start up of the SDGD subsystem), as more fully disclosed herein. As a result, if the SDGD subsystem is not ready for operation immediately at the start-up of the synchronous rectifier (or at another time) (e.g., is not powered up to operate at steady state), the synchronous rectifier can still function to rectify an input power signal and produce a desired rectified signal as an output (e.g., diode-bridge type functionality is inherent in the synchronous rectifier). For example, the SDGD subsystem can operate to control the switches on the top-side portion and the switches on the low-side portion so that these switches will not change state (e.g., switch to an on state) until the SDGD subsystem has been set up, for example, during initial gate-drive start up, to operate at steady state. In still another aspect, the system can include a zero-cross con- troller component(s) that can facilitate providing a desired positive voltage signal to a comparator(s) associated with a switch(es) (e.g., low-side switch) to facilitate ensuring that the associated switch(es) is in an off state at or near zero- crossing points during half-cycles of the signal. In yet another aspect, the multi-phase synchronous rectifier can be employed in high-voltage power applications (e.g., 110 V or\n\nThe following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the disclosed subject matter. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the inno- vation may be employed and the disclosed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and distinctive features of the disclosed subject matter will become apparent from the following detailed description of the innovation when considered in conjunction with the drawings.\n\nIn an embodiment, a multi-phase system can comprise a multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) synchronous rectifier that can be employed to receive and synchronously rectify a multi- phase signal (e.g., multi-phase AC power signal) and produce a desired signal (e.g., rectified DC power signal) as an output.

One example switch that can be employed is a MOSFET which has an inherent body diode in its structure. Ifeach current loop of the rectifier circuit has at least one current-controlled gate drive, the combined actions of the MOSFET and its body diode can offer the diode functions (e.g., diode rectification functions) at low conduction loss. This can allow the low on-state resistance of the MOSFET to carry the current most of the time in a conducting period except for two small time regions at the beginning and the end of the conducting period in which the body diode of the MOSFET will conduct instead. Using the 10 A application as an example, when the current is high (e.g., 0.5 A to 10 A in a 10 A application), the PR,,,, conduction loss for the MOSFET is reduced. If the MOSFET is controlled to conduct the current in the range of 0.5 A to 10 A, the conduction is reduced when compared with that of a power diode. When the current in the MOSFET drops to less than a certain predefined value (e.g., 0.5 A), the MOSFET is turned off and its body diode will take over (e.g., carry) the current at the expense of a relatively low conduction loss because the current is small, wherein conduction loss is deter- mined as V,x1,. If the body diode current is reversed, this body diode will be turned off similar to a normal power diode after the current reverse-recovery process is completed. In this way, the combined actions of the MOSFET and its body diode can emulate the diode behavior with a low-loss con- duction mechanism and a diode natural turn-off mechanism, respectively. Since this current-controlled MOSFET can behave like a power diode, there is no need to include addi- tional timing or control circuit to determine the type or nature\n\nFIG. 36 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary methodology creating a synchronous rectifier in accordance with vari- aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nThe disclosed subject matter is described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following descrip- tion, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It may be evident, however, that the disclosed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block dia- gram form in order to facilitate describing the various embodiments herein.\n\nDiode bridges, sometimes also referred to as bridge recti- fiers, can be used to rectify a received AC signal and produce a DC signal as output. One significant drawback with diode bridges is a relatively high amount of conductive loss realized in processing the received signal. For example, the typical voltage drop V,, of a power diode is 1.0 volt (V). For a diode current I, of 10 amps (A), the conduction loss is 10 watts (W), in accordance with the equation P=V_xl,.\n\nassociated with bridge rectifiers, synchronous rectifiers, based on the use of power metal-oxide-semiconductor field- effect transistors (MOSFETs) to replace the diodes (e.g., the diode bridge), have been predominately used in low-voltage and high-current applications. Some power MOSFETs can have an on-state resistance, R,,,, as low as 40 mQ. For current of 10 A, the conduction loss is PR,,=4 W. This is a reduction from the power loss (e.g., 6 W power savings) when compared to a power diode. However, the conventional synchronous rectifiers suffer from a number of significant drawbacks, including, for example, requiring a customized charge pump circuit in order to provide a suitable DC power supply for a gate drive, only being suitable for low-voltage and high-frequency (>100 kHz) applications, but not mains voltage and mains frequency operations, requiring logic cir- cuits that have to be tailor-made to cater for a particular application. For the synchronous rectifier proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,425 for mains voltage and main frequency operation, complicated timing circuits are needed to check the switching times for the MOSFETs in order to differentiate different types of loads. It is desirable to be able to provide self-driven AC-DC synchronous rectification technique that can be used to develop an AC-DC synchronous rectifier that can behave like a diode bridge and be used in high-voltage power applications, but with significantly reduced conduc- tion losses and without requiring control integrated circuits. It\n\nbody can behave just like a diode under the disclosed switching control, there is no need to use sophisticated control and monitoring circuits which is either (i) used to determine the nature of the load or (ii) dependent on the nature of the load (as in conven- tional rectifiers). In other words, the disclosed subject matter can enable the disclosed synchronous rectifier to replace the diode rectifier without the need to know the nature of the load. In addition, the control electronics can be powered by a por- tion of the AC voltage source or preferably a portion of the rectified DC voltage of the power rectifier circuit without the need for another specially designed auxiliary switched mode supply or transformers.\n\ncan synchronously rectify a received signal (e.g., power sig- nal) in accordance with various embodiments and aspects. In an aspect, the system 100 can comprise components and associated circuitry that form a synchronous rectifier (e.g., self-drive synchronous rectifier (also referred to herein as SDSR)), which includes self-driven control circuitry that can be employed in high-voltage power applications while pro- viding the benefit ofa significantly smaller conduction loss as compared to, for example, a conventional diode bridge. The system 100 can receive a signal, such as, for example, an AC power signal, and can rectify the received signal to produce a desired output signal, such as a desired DC signal, which can be supplied to a desired load (e.g., resistive load, capacitive- resistive load, inductive-resistive load) (not shown). As desired, the system 100 can be employed in high-voltage applications (e.g., 110 V or 220 V mains), and also can\n\nTo that end, systems, methods, and devices that can pro- duce, employ, or comprise a single-phase and multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) AC-DC synchronous rectifier, which includes self-driven control component (e.g., comprising self-driven control circuitry), for use in high-voltage power applications are presented. In an aspect, the synchronous rectifier circuitry can behave like or emulate a diode bridge (e.g., a bridge rectifier), while also being able to provide the benefit of a significantly smaller conduction loss as compared\n\nIn an embodiment, the system 100 can include a first pair of switches, switch 102 (M1 in FIG. 1) and switch 108 (M4 in\n\nfor\n\nous\n\nConventionally, to\n\nfacilitate reducing conduction losses\n\na\n\n6\n\nW\n\na\n\nis also desirable to be able to use such an AC-DC synchronous rectifier in single-phase and multi-phase systems.\n\n10\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nto a diode bridge.

In\n\nstill another aspect, to facilitate desired Switching in order to\n\nnent 214, SDGD component 216, SDGD component 218,\n\n65\n\nbody diode 220, body diode 222, body diode 224, and body\n\nemulate the rectification of a diode bridge, including at initial\n\nstart-up of the SDGD subsystem, the system 100 can be\n\ndiode 226, each can be the same or Substantially the same as,\n\nUS 8,913,409 B2\n\n9\n\n10\n\nstructured such that bridge-rectifier type functionality is inherent in the SDSR to facilitate controlling switching of switch 102 and switch 104 so that switch 102 and switch 104 will not switch to an undesired state (e.g., on state) before the SDGD subsystem has been set up (e.g., set to and operating in a desired operating state). For instance, the switches 102, 104, 106, and 108 can respectively comprise body diodes 120, 122, 124, and 126, wherein the arrangement of the switches 102, 104, 106, and 108, and thus, the body diodes 120, 122, 124, and 126 in the circuit can be such that the body diodes 120, 122, 124, and 126 can be structured and can function as a bridge-rectifier, including during initial start-up of the SDSR. (e.g., prior to the rectified DC voltage providing at least a portion of the desired to the switches of the SDSR).\n\nwhich can be connected to a power source 110 (e.g., AC power source) that can produce a desired input voltage signal. In an aspect, to facilitate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, a switch of the first pair of switches, switch 102 and/or switch 108, can be turned on (e.g., placed in or transitioned to an on state) when the voltage across the particular switch is forward-biased, and a switch of the sec- ond pair of switches, switch 106 and/or switch 104, can be turned off (e.g., placed in or transitioned to an off state) when. the switch current is reversed (e.g., similar to diode current reverse recovery). Thus, to facilitate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, there can be at least one current-controlled self-driven (CCSD) switch (e.g., switch 106, switch 108) in each of current path of the circuit of the synchronous rectifier (e.g., the equivalent diode-bridge cir- cuit). For instance, in system 100, switch 106 and switch 108 can be CCSD switches that each can be respectively con- trolled by sensing the current through such switch and can be turned or switched to the off state whenever the current sensed across such switch is reversed. The combined actions of the switch (e.g., MOSFET) and its body diode can provide such diode functions as more fully disclosed herein. In an aspect, it can be desirable for each current path to contain at least one CCSD switch to ensure automatic turn off of the switch at desired switching times, wherein, for example, the CCSD switch can emulate a diode turning off after current reverse recovery. In another aspect, switch 102 and switch 104 can be voltage-controlled self-driven (VCSD) switches that each can be turned to the on state when such switch is forward-biased in the same way as when the bridge is connected to a pure resistive load. With a current sensing circuitry, a VCSD switch does not have the emulated diode turn-off mechanism. However, it can be lower in cost when compared witha CCSD switch. As long as each current loop has one CCSD switch, such CCSD switch can turn off and cut off the current in the current loop like a power diode. Thus, the current in the VCSD switch in the same current loop will be cut off when the CCSD switch turns off. However, it is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with other embodiments, the switches 102 and/or 104 also can be CCSD switches, instead of VCSD switches. In accordance with an embodiment, one or more of the switches 102, 104, 106, and/or 108 can be MOSFETs (e.g., power MOSFETs). For example, switch 102 and/or 104, which can be VCSD switches, can be n-type\n\nan aspect, can operate power (e.g., can employ components using low power), in contrast to the switches 102 through 108, which can be power devices. In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem, or at least a desired portion thereof, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In another aspect, the SDGD subsystem can comprise ahigh-side portion, which can include SDGD component 112 and SDGD component 114, and a low-side portion, which can include SDGD component 116 and SDGD component 118, wherein the high-side portion and the low-side portion can be symmetrical. Thus, the synchronous rectifier of system 100 can be a self-driven synchronous rectifier (SDSR), wherein the switches 102, 104, 106, and 108, with the associated SDGD subsystem, can form, emulate, and/or function as a diode bridge, but with significant reduction in conduction loss as compared to conventional diode bridges or synchronous\n\nsystem can synchronously rectify a signal (e.g., power signal) in accordance with various embodiments and aspects. The system 200 can be or can comprise a SDSR that can form, emulate, and/or function as diode bridge, but with significant reduction in conduction loss as compared to conventional diode bridges or synchro- nous rectifiers. In accordance with an aspect, the system 200 can comprise switch 202 (M1 in FIG. 2) and switch 208 (M4 in FIG. 2), which can be associated with a first conducting path, and switch 206 (M3 in FIG. 2) and switch 204 (M2 in FIG. 2), which can be associated with a second conducting path, wherein the first conducting path and second conducting path can be connected to a power source 210 (e.g., AC power source) that can produce a desired input power signal. The system 200 also can include an SDGD subsystem that can comprise SDGD components 212, 214, 216, and 218, which can be respectively associated with (e.g., electrically con- nected to) switch 202, switch 204, switch 206, and switch 208, to facilitate controlling switching of the respective switches in response to the input voltage signal. In another aspect, switch 202 can include body diode 220, switch 204 can include body diode 222, switch 206 can include body diode 224, and switch 208 can include body diode 226, wherein the arrangement of the switches 202, 204, 206, and 208, and thus, the body diodes 220, 222, 224, and 226 in the circuit can be such that the body diodes 220, 222, 224, and 226 can be structured and can inherently function as a bridge- rectifier, including during initial start-up of the SDSR (e.g.\uff0c prior to the rectified DC voltage providing at least a portion of the desired power to the switches of the SDSR). Switch 202, switch 204, switch 206, switch 208, power source 210, the SDGD subsystem, SDGD component 212, SDGD compo-\n\ndriven gate-drive (SDGD) subsystem, which can comprise SDGD components 112 (also referred to as GR, in FIG. 1), 114 (also referred to as GR, in FIG. 1), 116 (also referred to as GR, in FIG. 1), and 118 (also referred to as GR, in FIG. 1), which can be respectively associated with (e.g., electrically connected to) switch 102, switch 104, switch 106, and switch 108 to facilitate controlling switching of the switch compo- nents 102, 104, 106, and 108 at respective desired times to facilitate rectifying the input signal (e.g., AC power signal) and producing the rectified output signal (e.g., DC signal). The SDGD subsystem can include desired components, including transistors, capacitors, diodes, resistors, and asso- ciated circuitry, etc., in accordance with a desired circuit design, such as more fully described herein to facilitate con- trolling switching of the switches 102, 104, 106, and 108. In still another aspect, to facilitate desired switching in order to emulate the rectification of a diode bridge, including at initial\n\nFIG. 1), associated with a first conducting path and a second pair of switches, switch 106 (M3 in FIG. 1) and switch 104 (M2 in FIG. 1), associated with a second conducting path,\n\nenhancement power MOSFETs. In another aspect, the system 100 can comprise a\n\nself-\n\nstart-up of the SDGD subsystem, the system 100\n\ncan be\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\npower the SDGD subsystem\n\nIn\n\nunder low\n\nrectifiers. Referring to FIG. 2, illustrated is a circuit diagram of an example 200 that received\n\na\n\nnent 214, SDGD component 216, SDGD component 218, body diode 220, body diode 222, body diode 224, and body diode 226, each can be the same or substantially the same as,\n\nUS 8,913,409 B2\n\n11\n\n12\n\nand can include the same or similar functionality as, respec\n\nassociated with resistor Rio (e.g., 10.092), can be employed\n\ntive components (e.g., respectively named components).

While Switch 202 and Switch 204 are VCSD\n\n15\n\ncapacitors C and C, until the capacitors C and Cs reach a\n\nswitches in the above embodiment, it is to be appreciated and\n\ncertain defined voltage, which can be determined by the Zener\n\nunderstood that, in accordance with other embodiments, the\n\ndiodes D and D4, respectively, contained in the SDGD\n\nswitches 202 and/or 204 also can be CCSD switches, instead\n\ncomponent 212 and SDGD component 214. In an aspect, the\n\nof VCSD Switches.\n\nIn another aspect, the SDGD components 212, 214, 216,\n\nbipolar transistors Q and Q can be used to facilitate ensuring\n\nthe capacitors C and C will not be charged before capacitors\n\nand 218 each can respectively be and/or can comprise low\n\npower components, as compared to the Switches 202 through\n\nC and Chave been charged up to a Voltage higher than the\n\nVoltage of capacitors C and Cs.

In still\n\n25\n\ncomponent 214 has been set up to operate in normal operating\n\nanother aspect, the SDGD component 212 and SDGD com\n\nstate (e.g., steady state operation).\n\nponent 214 can be included in a high-side portion of the\n\nIn an aspect, the capacitors C and C can be charged and\n\nSDGD subsystem, and SDGD component 216 and SDGD\n\ndischarged at line frequency. For instance, the capacitors C\n\ncomponent 218 can be included in a low-side portion of the\n\nSDGD subsystem, wherein the high-side portion and low\n\nand C can be charged up to a defined voltage V (e.g.,\n\n30\n\napproximately 13.0 Volts (V)) in every charging period and\n\nside portion can be symmetrical. In yet another aspect, the\n\ncircuitry of the SDGD component 216 and SDGD component\n\ncan be discharged to a different defined voltage V (e.g.,\n\n218 can be grounded with the power circuits (e.g., circuitry\n\napproximately 12.0 V), which can be a relatively lower volt\n\nage than Voltage V, after each discharging period.\n\nassociated with the power Switches) and the power Supplies\n\nReferring briefly to FIGS. 3A through 3I (along with FIG.\n\nfor the SDGD component 216 and SDGD component 218 can\n\n35\n\n2), FIGS. 3A through 3I depict diagrams of operation, in\n\nbe derived (e.g., obtained) from the output DC voltage from\n\nthe synchronous rectifier of system 200.\n\nrelation to time, of an example system 300, which is a portion\n\nof the system 200 comprising the high-side gate-drives (e.g.,\n\nIn accordance with an embodiment, with regard to the\n\nhigh-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, each of SDGD\n\nSDGD component 212 and SDGD component 214) to facili\n\ntate demonstrating operation of the high-side gate drives over\n\ncomponent 212 and SDGD component 214 can respectively\n\n40\n\ncomprise three capacitors have respective desired capaci\n\ntime in an aspect of the disclosed subject matter. Referring to\n\ntance values, wherein SDGD component 212 can comprise\n\nFIG. 3A, illustrated is operation of the system 300 (and the\n\ncapacitors (C), C (e.g., 470.0 nano-Farads (nF)), C (e.g.,\n\nsystem 200 and FIG. 2) during a time prior to time t. With\n\nregard to system 300, the respective Voltages, v,\n\nand vs.\n\n11.0LF), and C (e.g., 2.2LF), and SDGD component 214 can\n\ncomprise capacitors, C (e.g., 470.0 nE), Cs (e.g., 11.0 LF),\n\ncan represent the base-collector Voltages of the transistors Q.\n\n45\n\nand Qs (e.g., bipolar junction transistors (BJT)), respectively.\n\nand C (e.g., 2.2 LF). Each of SDGD component 212 and\n\nSDGD component 214 (e.g., each upper gate drive) can\n\nAt a time before time t, the input voltage signal, v, can be\n\nat a higher Voltage level than Voltage V. At this point in time,\n\ninclude three driving stages. For example, the SDGD com\n\nponent 212, which is associated with switch 202, can com\n\nboth the current directions in resistors R (e.g., 1.3 MS2) and\n\nprise, for example, transistor Q and transistor Q, Switch Ms\n\nRs (e.g., 1.3 MS2) can be from left to right as illustrated in FIG.\n\n50\n\n3A. The Voltage vs can be clamped to Zero Voltage, or at\n\nand Switch Me, and transistor Q and transistor Qs, which can\n\nleast Substantially close to a Zero Voltage, by a p-n junction\n\nform the three driving stages. Transistors Q and Q can be\n\nemployed for signal amplifying and providing a charging\n\nbetween the collector and base of the transistor Q. As a\n\npath for the power supplies of the driving circuit of switch 204\n\nresult, the switch Ms (e.g., p-channel MOSFET) can be\n\nturned or Switched to an on State and the Switch Me (e.g., the\n\n(M), Switches Ms and M can form an inverter, and transis\n\n55\n\ntors Q and Qs, which can be associated with resistor Rs\n\nn-channel MOSFET) can be turned or switched to an offstate,\n\n(e.g., 10.0C2), can be employed for desirably fast driving of\n\nand Such condition can maintain the gate-source Voltage of\n\nthe switch 202 (e.g., power MOSFET M1). Similarly, the\n\nthe switch 202 at high level, which can thereby turn or switch\n\nSDGD component 214, which is associated with switch 204,\n\nthe switch 202 to an on state. Meanwhile, with regard to the\n\nSDGD component 214, the current flowing through the resis\n\ncan comprise, for example, transistor Q, and transistor Qs,\n\n60\n\ntor Rs can flow through the p-n junction between the base and\n\nSwitch M7 and Switch Ms., and transistor Q and transistor\n\nQo, which can form the three driving stages. Transistors Q.,\n\ncollector of the transistor Q7, which can clamp the Voltage\n\nand Qs can be employed for signal amplifying and providing\n\nvs to voltage V. As a result, the Switch M, can be turned or\n\na charging path for the power Supplies of the driving circuit of\n\nswitched to an off state and the switch Ms can be turned or\n\nSwitched to an on State to maintain the gate-source Voltage of\n\nswitch 202 (M), switches M, and Ms., which can be respec\n\n65\n\ntively connected to R-7 (e.g., 5.1 kS2) and Rs (e.g., 5.1 kS2), can\n\nthe switch 204 at a low level, which can thereby turn or switch\n\nform an inverter, and transistors Q and Qo, which can be\n\nthe switch 204 to an off state.\n\nUS 8,913,409 B2\n\n12\n\n11\n\nassociated with resistor R,, (e.g., 10.0), can be employed desirably fast driving of the switch 202.\n\ncan include the same or similar functionality as, respec- tive components (e.g., respectively named components), such more fully described herein, for example, with regard to system 100.\n\npower supplies of the first-stage driving pair. Before capaci- tors C, and C, have been charged up to a certain predefined threshold voltage (e.g., 10V), the respective driving logic in the respective circuits of the respective SDGD 212 andSDGD 214 will not be ready to operate in the desired steady state. Capacitors Cs and C, can be charged as the power supplies for riving switch 202 and switch 206, respectively. During the start-up stage, the capacitors C, and Cs, which respectively can be associated with (e.g., connected to) Rs (e.g., 50.0 MQ) and Rs (e.g., 50.0 MQ), can be designed (e.g., can have esired capacitance values) to be charged up quicker than capacitors Cr and Cs, until the capacitors C, and Cs reach a certain defined voltage, which can be determined by the zener diodes Dz, and Dz, respectively, contained in the SDGD component 212 and SDGD component 214. In an aspect, the bipolar transistors Qi and Q, can be used to facilitate ensuring the capacitors C, and C, will not be charged before capacitors C, and C, have been charged up to a voltage higher than the voltage of capacitors Ca and Cs. Therefore, as a result, the switch 202 and switch 204 will not switch before the respec- tive driving logic of the SDGD component 212 and SDGD component 214 has been set up to operate in normal operating\n\nIn accordance with an aspect, the switches 202, 204, 206, and/or 208 can be power switches (e.g., power MOSFETs). In another aspect, the switch 202 and switch 204 can be VCSD switches (e.g., n-type enhancement power MOSFETs) that each can be turned to the on state when such switch is for- ward-biased, and the switch 206 and switch 208 can be CCSD switches that each can be respectively controlled by sensing the current through such switch and can be turned or switched to the off state whenever the current sensed across such switch reversed. While switch 202 and switch 204 are VCSD switches in the above embodiment, it is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with other embodiments, the switches 202 and/or 204 also can be CCSD switches, instead of VCSD switches.\n\nIn another aspect, the SDGD components 212, 214, 216, and 218 each can respectively be and/or can comprise low power components, as compared to the switches 202 through 208, which can be power devices. In an embodiment, the SDGD components 212, 214, 216, and 218, or a desired portion thereof, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In still another aspect, the SDGD component 212 and SDGD com- ponent 214 can be included in a high-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, and SDGD component 216 and SDGD component 218 can be included in a low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, wherein the high-side portion and low- side portion can be symmetrical.

For instance, the capacitors C, and C, can be charged up to a defined voltage V, (e.g., approximately 13.0 volts (V)) in every charging period and can be discharged to a different defined voltage V, (e.g., approximately 12.0 V), which can be a relatively lower volt- age than voltage Vi, after each discharging period.\n\n2), FIGS. 3A through 31 depict diagrams of operation, in relation to time, ofan example system 300, which is a portion of the system 200 comprising the high-side gate-drives (e.g., SDGD component 212 and SDGD component 214) to facili- tate demonstrating operation of the high-side gate drives over time in an aspect of the disclosed subject matter. Referring to FIG. 3A, illustrated is operation of the system 300 (and the system 200 and FIG. 2) during a time prior to time t,. With regard to system 300, the respective voltages, vaca and Vgce; can represent the base-collector voltages of the transistors Q, and Q, (e.g., bipolar junction transistors (BJT)), respectively. At a time before time t,, the input voltage signal, v,,,, can be at a higher voltage level than voltage V,. At this point in time, both the current directions in resistors R, (e.g., 1.3 MQ) and R; (e.g., 1.3 MQ) can be from left to right as illustrated in FIG. 3A. The voltage vscs can be clamped to zero voltage, or at least substantially close to a zero voltage, by a p-n junction between the collector and base of the transistor Q;. As a result, the switch Ms\u3002 (e.g., p-channel MOSFET) can be turned or switched to an on state and the switch Me (e.g., the n-channel MOSFET) can be turned or switched to an off state, and such condition can maintain the gate-source voltage of the switch 202 at high level, which can thereby turn or switch the switch 202 to an on state. Meanwhile, with regard to the SDGD component 214, the current flowing through the resis- tor R, can flow through the p-n junction between the base and collector of the transistor Q,, which can clamp the voltage Vacs to voltage V,.

The loss of the SR circuit can be expressed as:\n\nIn an aspect, the self-driven synchronous rectifier of sys- tem 200 is designed to manage resistive, capacitive, and/or inductive loads.

If there is not addi- tional circuitry (e.g., additional control circuit) to facilitate turning the comparators CP, and CP, to an off state at certain desired times (e.g., at or near a half cycle), the comparators CP, and/or CP, may not respond quickly enough to turn off switch 206 and switch 208 under such a fast current change, which can or may cause an undesirable (e.g., fatal) short circuit situation. Therefore, in accordance with an aspect, the system 200 can include additional circuitry to provide a desired relatively small positive signal to the non-inverting inputs of the comparators CP, and CP3.\n\nwhere Rosco is the on state resistance of the MOSFETs.

The desired relatively small posi- tive signal can be generated from the rectified voltage (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 1), and such signal can ensure or at least substantially ensure that operation of the comparators CP, and CP, can be controlled to turn switch 208 and switch 204 to an off state at or before a desired time, to facilitate prevent- ing an undesirable (e.g., fatal) short circuit in the system 200. The system 700 (and system 200) can include a zener diode D-_,, which can have a predefined rating voltage parameter value (e.g., rating voltage at or approximately 10.0 V). When the rectified voltage begins to rise from zero voltage, the voltage of the zener diode D,, can rise until it reaches its predefined rating voltage. Once the zener diode D,, attains its predefined rating voltage, the zener diode D_, can maintain this voltage level with very little voltage fluctuation. In another aspect, the system 700 (and system 200) can include resistors R,, (e.g., 10.0 MQ) and Rs (e.g., 43.0 kQ) that can form a voltage divider to facilitate producing a scaled-down voltage signal with relatively reduced voltage fluctuation, wherein the scaled-down voltage signal can be provided to a diode Di associated with the comparators CP, and CP. The rising period and falling period of the scaled-down voltage\n\nIn the prototype, R=R5=1.3MQ; R,=1M=z; R,=0.002Q; Rps(onj70-045Q; V-<1.1V at 30 A (V=1V is assumed for calculation).\n\nWhen V,,,,=V;,-L10V, Pp,ive-%31 milliwatts (mW), the current range is 0.016<I/<21.724 A. When Vou V n= 220V, Pryiver124 mW, and the current range 0.062<1<21.677 A.\n\nSince the body diodes of the MOSFETs are used during the start-up phase of the system (before the DC output is ready to power the control electronic circuit of the SDSR) and after the corresponding MOSFETS have turned off at near-zero cur- rent (about 0.5 A), the conduction loss of the body diodes of the MOSFETs is negligible. In general, the power loss of the diode rectifier and the SDSR for the capacitive load and inductive load can be analyzed in the same way as the resistive load. The major power loss reduction component comes from the difference between the conduction loss of the diodes in the diode bridge and the on-state resistance of the MOSFETs in the SDSR. For a current of 10 A, for example, a diode has a conduction loss of about 10 W, while a MOSFET (with on- state resistance of 45 m2) only dissipates 4.5 W.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\no\n\nthe\n\npower\n\nbe\n\na\n\ndiode\n\nand\n\nis\n\nUS 8,913,409 B2\n\n17\n\n18\n\ndepicts a diagram of example graph 1400 comprising a rec\n\nExperimental verification based on a single-phase syn\n\ntified DC output capacitor voltage waveform associated with\n\nchronous rectifier was performed to compare a SDSR, in\n\nthe conventional diode bridge in relation to the capacitive\n\naccordance with aspects and embodiments of the Subject\n\nspecification, with a conventional diode bridge.

The SDGD subsystem can comprise SDGD component 2114, which can be associated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2102; SDGD component 2116, which can be asso- ciated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2104; SDGD component 2118, which can be associ- ated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2106; SDGD component 2120, which can be associated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2108; SDGD component 2122, which can be associated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2110; and SDGD component 2124, which can be associated with and\n\nThe respective switches 2102, 2104, 2106, 2108, 2110, and 2112, each can include respective body diodes 2128 (for reason of clarity, included but not expressly labeled in FIG. 21, but expressly identified in other figures, including FIG. 25A), 2130 (for reason of clarity, included but not expressly labeled in FIG. 21, but expressly identified in other figures, including FIG. 25A), 2132, 2134, 2136, and 2138. In an aspect, the body diodes 2128, 2130, 2132, 2134, 2136, and 2138 can be structured and can be arranged in the circuit in relation to each other and other components, such that they can inherently function as a bridge-rectifier, as desired, including during initial start-up of the SDSR (e.g., prior to the rectified DC voltage providing at least a portion of the desired power to the switches of the SDSR).\n\nInitially, when powering up the system 2100, the SDGD subsystem can go through a start-up phase until steady state operation is achieved. During the start-up phase, the capaci- tors C,, C4 and C, will be charged up as the power supplies of the first-stage. Before the capacitors C,,C, and C, have been charged up to an applicable predefined threshold voltage (e.g., 10V), the driving logic in the SDGD subsystem will not be ready to fully function to facilitate controlling respective switching of the switches 2102 through 2112.\n\nThe SDGD subsystem is designed to consume a relatively low amount of power, and can be powered by and receive power from the output rectified DC signal from the SDSR. In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem can be formed as an integrated circuit. In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can be divided into a desired number of parts, such as, for example, two parts comprising a high-side portion and low-side por- tion. The high-side portion and low-side portion can be sym- metrical.\n\naspect, charged as the power supplies to facilitate driving the switch 2102 (M,), the switch 2104 (M,), and the switch 2106 (M,), respectively. During the start-up stage, the capacitors C,, Cs and C,, which can be respectively associated with resistors R,, Ry and R,, for use by capacitors C,, Cs and Ca, can be designed to be charged up more quickly than the capacitors C,, C, and Cy, until the capacitors C,, C; and Cs respectively reach a predefined voltage, wherein the predefined voltage can be determined based at least in part on the respective zener diodes Dz,, Dz, and Dz,. Instill another aspect, bipolar transistors Q,, Qs, and Qis can be used to facilitate ensuring the capacitors C3, C, and Cy will not be charged (e.g., fully charged to a predefined voltage level) before a time that the capacitors C,, C, and C, have been charged up to a voltage level that is higher than the voltage level of the capacitors C3, C,andC,. As a result, the power switches, switch 2102 (M,), switch 2104 (M,), and switch 2106 (M,), will not switch before the driving logic of the SDGD subsystem has been initialized and set up to operate at a desired steady-state\n\nAs disclosed, the switches 2102 through 2112, and associ- ated body diodes 2128 through 2138, can be arranged in the circuit of system 2100 to form, at least in part, the multi-phase SDSR that can be in the form of, function as, or emulate a diode bridge (e.g., diode rectifier). As a result, even if the SDGD components are not ready for operation (e.g., steady state operation) immediately at the start-up of the system 2100, the diode bridge functionality is inherent in the system 2100 to desirably perform the function of multi-phase recti- fication of the input power signal, because the six body diodes 2128 through 2138 of the six switches 2102 through 2112 are arranged in the circuit to form a three-phase diode bridge that can rectify the applied input power signal to produce a desired rectified DC voltage as an output when the switches 2102 through 2012 are not turned on (e.g., during initial start-up of the SDSR prior to steady-state operation of the SDSR). In an aspect, the system 2100 can include a power source 2126, which can be a multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) AC source, that can be connected to, and can apply the input power signal (e.g., AC power signal) to, the power switches 2102 through\n\nTo make the analysis more clear, assume that the voltage of the capacitors C,, C,, and C, will remain constant at a voltage V. The voltage vacw can represent the base-collector voltages of Q,, (e.g., BIT Q,,), wherein n can be an integer value. Referring briefly to FIG. 22 (along with FIG. 21), depicted is an example portion of an input power signal waveform 2200 for a three-phase signal, comprising phase A, phase B, and phase C, in an aspect.

To counter this potential problem, the subject speci- fication (e.g., system 2100, system 2100) can include a zero- crossing controller component to that can facilitate desired switching of an associated power switch at zero-crossing points.\n\nReferring to FIG. 25G, depicted is operation of the system 2500 (and the system 2100 in FIG. 21) during the time period. of time t, to t,. At or near time t,, the voltage vascio can drop down below the applicable predefined gate threshold switch- ing voltage of the switch Mio, and, as a result, the switch Mio can be turned from an on state to an off state, and voltage Vecio can continue to decrease. The time period of time ts to t, can end when voltage vz-)9 reaches zero voltage.\n\n21), illustrated is an example zero-crossing controller com- ponent 2800 that can facilitate at least partially controlling operation (e.g., switching) of a comparator (e.g., CP;) and associated power switch (e.g., switch 2110 (Ms)) at desired times (e.g., at or near zero-crossing points) in accordance with an aspect. In an aspect, the zero-crossing controller component 2800 can provide or supply a desired relatively small positive voltage signal to the non-inverting inputs of a comparator (e.g., CP). The small positive voltage signal can be generated from the input voltage of Phase C as illustrated. in FIG. 27, which illustrates a diagram of example driving waveforms 2700 of the Phase B low-side portion (e.g., SDGD component 2122) of the SDGD subsystem. In an aspect, the small positive voltage signal can facilitate ensuring that the comparator CP, can operate to apply a desired voltage to the gate of the power switch 2110 (M;) to switch the power switch 2110 (Ms)in time at or near the zero-crossing point to prevent an undesirable short circuit situation. In another aspect, the zero-crossing controller component 2800 can con- tain a zener diode D,, which can have a desired predefined rating voltage (e.g., 1OV). When the voltage vy begins to rise from zero volts, the voltage of the zener diode D_, will rise until the voltage level reaches the predefined rating voltage of the zener diode D_;. The zener diode D_, can maintain this voltage at the predefined rating voltage with very small fluc- tuation. In still another aspect, the zero-crossing controller component 2800 can include resistors Rs and R3, that can form a voltage divider to facilitate scaling down the voltage signal (with a desired amount of scaling down) with reduced fluctuation, and also can include capacitor C,4, and resistors\n\nFIG. 25H illustrates operation of the system 2500 (and the system 2100 in FIG. 21) during the time period after time ty.

The SDGD components 2120, 2122, and 2124 can respectively include current sensing resistors Rs), Rs, and Rs; and com- parators CP,, CP,, and CP, that can be used to detect the currents in the respective switches 2108, 2110, and 2112 and. drive the respective switches 2108, 2110, and 2112.\n\nan example system 2600 comprising the SDGD component 2122, which can be the drive circuit of the switch 2110 (Ms) (Phase B), in accordance with an aspect. In an aspect, the SDGD component 2122 can include capacitor C,, that can be used to supply a desired positive voltage signal for the invert- ing inputs of the comparators CP, (as shown in FIG. 21), CP, (as shown if FIGS. 21 and 26), and CP, (as shown in FIG. 22), which can provide a desired safe margin that can be set based. at least in part by the potential divider, comprising the resis- tors Ra and Rss, wherein diode D, can be employed for use with capacitor C,, and resistors Rs and R,;, and wherein capacitor C,, can be employed for use with comparator CP, and resistors R34 and Ras. The output of comparator CP, can be provided to transistors Q,, and Q,;, which can be associ- ated with resistor Ra to facilitate controlling switching of switch 2110. In another aspect, the voltage of capacitor Cis\uff0c which can be stabilized by the zener diode Dz,, can be the power supply for the comparators CP,, CP,, and CP, wherein resistor Rss can be employed for use with capacitor C,,; as well as other associated components, as shown in FIG. 21. The capacitor Cis will be charged up to the designated voltage before the voltage of capacitor Cis increases to reach voltage high enough for the comparators CP,, CP,, and CP, to operate. This arrangement of the SDGD subsystem, includ- ing SDGD component 2122, can ensure that the low-side switches, switch 2108 (M,), switch 2110 (Ms), and switch 2112 (M,), to be switched only when the SDGD subsystem has completed the start-up phase and reaches\n\nappreciated and understood that, due at least in part to the symmetry of the system 2100, the system 2100, as disclosed herein with regard to operation of the system wherein the output phase changes from phase A to phase B, can corre- spondingly operate as the output phase changes from phase B to phase C, and from phase C to phase A. As a result, corre- sponding components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, transistors, diodes, zener diodes, switches, etc.) of SDGD component 2118 can operate in a same or similar manner as the SDGD components 2114 and 2116 (e.g., in the high-side portion of the SDGD subsystem), and the SDGD components 2120 and 2124 can operate in a same or similar manner as the SDGD component 2122 (e.g., in the low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem).

The methodology 3400 can be uti- lized in single-phase and multi-phase systems. At 3402, a rectified power signal can be generated from an input power signal received by a subset of power switches, wherein power switches in the subset are arranged in relation to each other to emulate functionality of a diode rectifier. At 3404, at least a portion of the rectified power signal can be supplied to an SDGD subsystem associated with the subset of power switches to facilitate controlling respective switching of respective power switches of the subset of power switches in order to facilitate rectifying the input power signal.\n\nAt3606, a low-side portion ofthe SDGD subsystem, which can be associated with at least two other power switches of the plurality of power switches, can be formed. In an embodi- ment, the two other power switches (e.g., low-side power switches) can be CCSD MOSFET switches.\n\n3608, at one zero-crossing component can be formed, wherein the at least one zero-crossing con- troller component can be associated with at least one power switch of the plurality of power switches to facilitate switch- ing the at least one power switch to (or maintaining the at least one power switch in) an off state at or near a zero-crossing point (e.g., zero-voltage-crossing point at each half-cycle of an input AC voltage signal) associated with the at least one power switch. In an aspect, a zero-crossing controller com- ponent can supply a relatively small positive voltage signal to a non-inverting input of a comparator associated with the at least one power switch to facilitate ensuring that the at least one power switch is turned of at or near the zero-crossing point, wherein the comparator can be employed to facilitate controlling switching of the at least one power switch com- ponent. The zero-crossing controller component can thereby facilitate preventing an undesirable short circuit situation in the rectifier.\n\nTurning to FIG. 35, illustrated is an example methodology 3500 that can facilitate rectifying an input power signal in accordance with various aspects of the disclosed subject mat- ter. The methodology 3500 can be utilized in single-phase and multi-phase systems. At 3502, an input power signal (e.g., high power signal, such as 110 volts or 220 volts) can be received by a synchronous rectifier (e.g., SDSR).\n\nAt 3504, during at least a start-up phase of operation when SDGD system associated with the synchronous rectifier is not operating at steady state, switching of the subset of power switches can be controlled to maintain the subset of power switches in an off state.\n\nSome portions of the detailed description have been pre- sented in terms of algorithms and/or symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and/or representations are the means employed by those cognizant in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others equally skilled. An algorithm is here, generally, conceived to be a self-con- sistent sequence of acts leading to a desired result. The acts are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quan- tities. Typically, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical and/or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and/or other- wise manipulated.\n\nDC output voltage is ready to power up the control circuitry (e.g., SDGD system) for the switches (e.g., MOSFETs), the body diodes of the switches, which are arranged in relation to each other to form the traditional diode bridge rectifier circuit, can provide the initial rectification function. During the initial start-up stage (prior to steady-state operation of the SDSR), the conduction loss can be equivalent to that of a power diode bridge, however, the start-up stage lasts for only a short period of time. Once the rectified DC output voltage is available to power the control circuitry for the switches, the normal syn- chronous rectification of the SDSR with the relatively low conduction loss (as compared to conventional rectifier bridges) can begin. It is noted that, for a single-phase SDSR, the diagonal pair of switches can be turned on and off together to form a conducting path. For instance, with regard briefly to FIG. 1, switches 102 and 108 can form one pair, and switches 104 and 106 can form the other pair. However, these two pairs respective pairs of switches can be turned on and off in a complementary manner. That is, when switch 102 and switch 108 are turned on, switch 104 and switch 106 are turned off,\n\nIt has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, ele- ments, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be bore in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quan- tities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quan- tities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the foregoing discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the disclosed subject matter, discussions utilizing terms such as processing, computing, calculating, determining, and/or dis- playing, and the like, refer to the action and processes of computer systems, and/or similar consumer and/or industrial electronic devices and/or machines, that manipulate and/or transform data represented as physical (electrical and/or elec- tronic) quantities within the computer\u2019s and/or machine\u2019s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the machine and/or computer system memories or registers or other such information stor- age, transmission and/or display devices.\n\nAt 3506, a desired rectified power signal (e.g., rectified DC power signal) can be generated based at least in part on controlling of the switching of the power switches.
