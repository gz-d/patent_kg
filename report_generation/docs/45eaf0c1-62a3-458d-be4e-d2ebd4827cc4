The system includes a membrane-based thermochemical reactor. The reactor includes a solution channel having an absorbent-containing solution flowing therethrough and a refrigerant channel having a refrigerant flowing therethrough along with first and second fluid chan- nels. A porous membrane is positioned between the refrig- erant channel and the solution channel; the porous mem- brane permits flow of vapor molecules therethrough while restricting flow of absorbent molecules. The system further includes a solution storage repository in fluid communica- tion with the solution channel and a refrigerant repository In fluid communication with the refrigerant channel. The sys- tem can be used in high-density, high-efficiency, and low- temperature energy storage systems. The membrane-based reactor offers a large specific surface area and integrates solution/refrigerant flows, which enables formation of a highly compact reactor exhibiting strong heat/mass transfer. In some embodiments, direct diffusion of water molecules through the membrane makes it possible to lower the\n\nF28D 20/00\n\nFOLK 3/18\n\n(2006.01) (2006.01)\n\nrequired charging temperatures.\n\nOa a a a a a a a a a \u5e01 \u5168 a * \u7ad9 RRR OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OE OF OE OE OE OF OE OE OE OE E> pom ERSPATHON \u201c y, W WwW \u548c \u548c Coal at oat \u00a9 NOAM \u2018 \u00a9 ARR RR ANN RR AN A 8 RR RRS SO RR \u7ad9 a oe ST a \u00ab i\u201d woe vvv \u7ad9 AN Ak ROSA A A eS an mn \u00a9 RAR \u662f oe vvv wor \u00a9 a * Ca \u56db AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTT T AIR 3 \u00a9 a \u00ab i\u201d \u4e8c yy \u00a9 vvv aan ee ee oe vvvvvvv aan ee ee SOE OG \u8aaa vv ree kore hoe MMMM MAMMA MMMM MMM MG\n\nPatent Application Publication\n\nMar. 9, 2023 Sheet 1 of 10\n\n* a * \u201cOOG wor ON \u548c \u548c ae eo ee oe St > ae ae fod aia \u5230 + \u5230 Yu ae ai > * \u4e2d \u53f0 * * \u4e8c * Re oe 1 ra * we +> ie \u4e8c \u53f0 * \u7ad9 * hae ae ae de ae ae a\" * ae S \u53f0 \u53f0 5 \u53f0 \u53f0 ~ 5 1\u201d ie ie > ee = \u4e0b *,! ai ae\" ae ii ae \u4e2d * \"a \u7ad9 * \"a ss! yt 1 ra i We \u548c GO \u4e8c \u53f0 \u7ad9 * ae ae ae de ae ae ae\" * ae 5 * * 5 \u53f0 roe * ~ a ~ \u4eba \u548c \u53f0 \u4e0b a \u53f0 i ae ae Si ie ae \u7ad9 6 a YY Y \u5212 > \u548c www \u53f0 ee cd \u4e8c \u6709 a of \u7684 oy * Poe \u7684 \u7684 \u7684 \u7684 \u7684 \u7684 iG va ve oe Oe \u4e0b \u548c fot fot fot \u7ad9 \u00bb \u7ad9 \u7684 \u7ad9 va ee. ae \u53f7 \u7684 \u7684 \u53f7 \u2018* ai of of \u7684 \u4e86 \u7684 \u7684 \u2018x \u7684 va \u2018x ve if fot *, \u548c a, \u548c \u548c hs \u7ad9 \u7684 \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 an \u00a9 ae * \u00a9 a \u00a9 se ~ Cnt pt tant eC ent ate re a nt le et rr nn rn a ri tra ar re re a \u00bb , +9, *, Wo \u5167 oo Wo Wo oo oo AAAS AAAS BRAAAAAS AAS Wo Wo \u672c 4 mm Me \u4eba le % > fo ee \"4 4 ie ae rot \u7684 yy ae ~ ~ fot. coceoooco2sx ~ ren xx 1G x 9 va ae \u3010 xx X \u751f \u751f ~ te! ~ yy a yy foes X yy xx ~ a ae ~ . ~ foe. ~ ee ~ wa ha ee yy ~ *, \u548c Pe\" \u548c i a hs fats \u7684 ~ a ae ~ ~ ~ ~ ee a ea a ea ae oe oe \u8aaa \u548c \u548c \u4e8c \u548c \u548c (a7 \u548c yu yy ~ \u7684 ~ ~ \u5230 ~ \"x! ~ va ae ee a re ra ww ww av ww va ww se te! ee CC ee va . \u5230 va ea at OG + *, \u548c Ae a a foes \u7684 \u7684 ~ \u7684 \u2018x! ~ a \u2018x! va it 5 yy + *, a, \u548c \u548c hs yu yy \u548c ~ ~ \u548c ~ ee \u673a va oe ee Oe \"x! te! ~ ai a yy y yy \u7684 ~ \u7684 \u751f ~ \u2018x! va ha ee a *, *, \u548c ii i hs \u7684 \u7684 ~ ~ \u548c ~ . so va oe ee Oe te! ~ ai a i a fot rot fot fot \u4e8c \u751f \u96fb\u96fb \u548c \u548c \u672c \u548c on x a, wx FA ~ 4 RAR PE SOIAR \u4e00 SS \u2014~\n\nx\n\nA\n\n\u00a9\n\noe a ~ a \u4e8c \u4e8c ~ re at ~ oy \u4e8c \u4e8c ~ oe a ~\n\nCe MOMMA\n\n\n\nRR:\n\nCe MMMM MMM MMM MMMM?\n\n> a \u4e8c + te ae Oe ae ae * + ae Oe ie ae *\n\n\u5247\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\nUS 2023/00735850 Al\n\nT Did\n\nPatent Application Publication\n\nMar. 9, 2023 Sheet 2 of 10\n\nUS 2023/00735850 Al\n\nZ \u2018Did aa Lx) 74. + + 4 4 + + + * 504 OO Wo he) . \u65e5 . . . . . . \u65e5 . \u65e5 . we . . . we . . . . ee +4 + * * * ++ * are: \u2018area e te We vate tae. + * 2 Pat tat tad at ot at ae ee ee Si Si oi a Si i Si Si Si fe fat tata at Se aa Oa Pate aa Pa a a Pa ae a Pa. ae at Mat, TM Mt te, als a a TS ee EEE EE EEE PEPE PEPE PEPE PEPE PEPE PEEP PEPE 4: % ueseujou oF \u2018\u20ac Ct ee ee.

Within the category of building energy consumption, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) generally accounts for the largest proportion. Energy saving and emission mitigation by utilizing renew- able energy and waste heat in HVAC have been widely encouraged.\n\n[0003] Cooling, heating, and dehumidification by renew- able/waste energy are promising for building energy usage reduction and emission mitigation. However, the intermit- tent nature of renewable/waste energy results in inefficient and under-utilization of these energy sources.\n\nThermal\n\nis able\n\n[0004] energy storage to play a significant role in balancing the energy supply and energy demand. Thermal energy storage may be considered as temporarily maintaining thermal energy in the form of hot or cold substances, phase changes of phase change materials, or chemical reactions. By reversing the energy storage (for example changing phase from liquid to solid), the stored energy is released at a later time for use. Thermal energy storage can increase the efficiency of building energy sys- tems by storing energy between the time when thermal energy is produced and the time when the stored energy can be used by the building. For example, a peak load demand can be shifted to off-peak hours by utilizing stored heat from thermal unit.\n\nenergy\n\na\n\nenergy storage\n\n[0005] There are three types of thermal energy storage systems:\n\n[0006] Sensible: heat transfer to store and release heat temperature change\n\n[0007] Latent: for example, phase change materials using the latent heat of fusion\n\n[0008] Chemical: for example, absorption/desorption and thermochemical (a reversible chemical reaction that absorbs thermal energy and releases thermal energy).\n\n[0009] Absorption-based thermochemical energy storage outperforms the conventional sensible and latent thermal energy storage owing to its excellent energy storage density, energy storage efficiency, flexibility (cooling/heating/dehu- midification), and charging temperature. However, for exist- ing absorption-based thermochemical energy storage sys- tems, there are two major issues to be addressed for wider applications: reducing reactor size to improve energy stor- age density, and lowering the charging temperature to utilize low-grade thermal energy that otherwise is unusable. The widely-used immersed and falling-film reactors have limited absorption rates and separated solution/refrigerant flows, which significantly constrain the energy storage perfor- mance.\n\nvia\n\nMar. 9, 2023\n\n[0010] \u2018Therefore, there is a growing need to develop novel reactors to maximize energy density, lower the charging temperature, increase energy efficiency, and reduce capital cost.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0011] The present invention presents a novel thermo- chemical energy storage system using a microchannel mem- brane-based reactor; the reactor can be used in high-density, high-efliciency, and low-temperature energy storage sys- tems. The microchannel membrane-based reactor offers a large specific surface area and integrates solution/refrigerant flows, which enables formation of a highly compact reactor exhibiting strong heat/mass transfer. In some embodiments, direct diffusion of water molecules through the membrane makes it possible to lower the required charging tempera- tures.\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention presents\n\n[0012]\n\na thermochemical energy storage system.

For example, an absorption/desorption between a gas such as water vapor (H,O), ammonia (NH;) vapor, alcohol, hydro- fluorocarbon (HFC), hydrofluoroolefin (HFO), or CO, and a reagent such as salt, water, 1onic liquid, or other absorbents. The charging and discharging processes are represented by the equation below (diluted solution means a lower fraction of absorbent; concentrated solution means a higher fraction of absorbent):\n\n. charge \u4e00 Diluted + heat Concentrated + Refrigerant solution discharge solution\n\n[0025] In the charging process, the diluted solution is heated by thermal energy and becomes a concentrated solution after some refrigerant is generated (desorption); the thermal energy is stored in the concentrated solution. In the discharging process, the concentrated solution 1s mixed with the refrigerant (absorption) and becomes a diluted solution. The heat release is the useful output if the purpose is heating supply, while the cooling effect caused by the refrigerant evaporation is the useful output if the purpose is cooling supply.\n\n[0026] H.,O-based solutions (e.g., H,O/LiBr, H,O/LiCl) and NH,-based solutions (e.g., NH3/H,0, NH3/LiNO,) are widely used absorption working fluids. The energy storage mechanism of H,O-based solutions can be represented by the equation below:\n\nDiluted H50/ __ charge Concentrated H,O/ + heat <\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Absorb HyO Absorbent discharge sorbent\n\n[0027] The energy storage mechanism of NH,-based solu- tions can be represented by the equation below:\n\ncharge Concentrated Absorbent NH3/ Absorbent + heat discharge\n\nDiluted\n\nNH3/\n\nMar. 9, 2023\n\nNH, FIG. 1 depicts a membrane-based reactor 10 for ther- mochemical energy storage according to one embodiment of the present invention. The reactor 10 includes plural chan- nels for solution (refrigerant/absorbent mixture), refrigerant, and heat source/sink liquids. The heat source/sink liquids, which may be hot water, conduction oil, cooling water, chilled water, antifreeze, etc. depending on the role of the fluid in different operation modes, flow through liquid channel 20 and liquid channel 30, respectively. The refrig- erant channel 40 is positioned adjacent to the solution channel 50 and is separated by a porous membrane 45 and optional hollow membrane support plate 47. Note that the depiction of the reactor 10 is schematic only; the cross- sections of the various channels may be arbitrarily selected to be square, rectangular, circular, curved, and other selected shapes.\n\n[0028] The membrane 45 used in the membrane-based reactor 10 is a porous membrane that acts as a semi-barrier, allowing small-sized molecules (e.g., vaporized refrigerant) to pass through the membrane, while restricting larger-sized molecules (e.g., absorbent molecules) from passing through the membrane. Owing to the large specific surface area (interfacial area per unit volume) of the membrane, the membrane-based reactor provides a_ high-performance absorption/desorption process in a small volume, which is beneficial to the energy storage performance enhancement. Furthermore, the microchannels having a high specific sur- face area can be integrated with the membrane to obtain a highly-compact and highly-efhicient energy storage reactor. In one embodiment, the membrane may have a pore diam- eter in a range from approximately 0.2 to 6 microns with a thickness in a range from approximately 20 to approxi- mately 175 microns; porosity ranges from approximately 0.4 to 0.85. The porous membrane 1s selected from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), their composites, and other materials.\n\nporous\n\n[0029] FIG. 2 depicts a thermochemical energy storage system 100 that includes the membrane-based thermochemi- cal reactor 10 of FIG. 1. As seen in FIG. 2, a solution tank 110 acts as a receptacle for the solution (refrigerant/absor- bent mixture) while a refrigerant tank 120 acts as a recep- tacle for the refrigerant. A solution pump 112 may be used to circulate the refrigerant/absorbent solution and a refrig- erant pump 122 may be used to circulate the refrigerant.\n\n[0030] A charging process of the system is depicted in FIG. 2. A diluted solution in the solution tank 110 is pumped via pump 112 into the solution channel 50 of the reactor 10. A heat source (e.g., solar energy or waste energy) 130 generates heat that heats the liquid (e.g., water) in the liquid channel 30. Thermally driven by the heated liquid produced from the heat source, the diluted solution generates vapor- ized refrigerant whilst flowing inside the solution channel 50. The vaporized refrigerant passes through the porous membrane 45 and enters the refrigerant channel 40. Cooled by the cooling water produced from heat sink 140 (e.g., a cooling tower or evaporative cooler), the vaporized refrig- erant is condensed into liquid refrigerant in the refrigerant channel 40 and then flows into the refrigerant tank 120. The diluted solution becomes concentrated after the vapor gen- eration process and flows back to the solution tank 110. As the solution becomes increasingly concentrated, the thermal energy is stored in the form of thermochemical energy via solution concentration in the solution tank 110.\n\nthe\n\nglide\n\nUS 2023/0075850 Al\n\n[0031] With its selectivity characteristic, the porous mem- brane 45 separates the feed solution into a retentate (con- centrated solution) and a permeate (refrigerant) by control- ling the movement of molecules across the membrane. Vaporized refrigerant is separated from the solution due to the vapor refrigerant pressure difference even at low driving temperatures. Thus, the desorption (generation) process occurs before the solution is heated to the boiling point, making it possible to apply low-grade energy in the mem- brane-based thermochemical energy storage system. These low-grade energy sources are typically unusable in conven- tional systems, resulting in wasted energy.\n\n[0032] Note that all the figures only depict one module of the membrane-based reactor, more reactor modules can be combined in series or in parallel to enlarge the energy storage capacity.\n\ncan be discharged and used for\n\nThe stored\n\n[0033]\n\nenergy cooling and heating. The cold discharging process of the system 100 1s shown in FIG. 3. The concentrated solution in the solution tank 110 1s pumped into the solution channel 50 of the reactor 10 by the solution pump 112. Cooled by the cooling water produced from heat sink 160, the saturated partial vapor pressure decreases inside the solution channel 50. The liquid refrigerant in the refrigerant tank 120 is pumped into the refrigerant channel of the reactor by the refrigerant pump 122. Extracting low-grade heat from the chilled water in liquid channel 20, the liquid refrigerant evaporates and becomes vaporized refrigerant, which then passes through the membrane 45 and gets absorbed by the concentrated solution in the solution channel 50. The con- centrated solution becomes diluted after the vapor absorp- tion process and flows back to the solution tank 110. As the solution becomes increasingly diluted, the thermochemical energy is discharged for cooling via the evaporation effect in\n\nliquid channel 20.\n\n[0034] The heat discharging process of the system is shown in FIG. 4. The heat/mass transfer process is similar to that of the cold discharging process, except that the evapo- ration process extracts low-grade heat from the source liquid in liquid channel 20. The thermochemical energy is dis- charged for heating to the heat demand side 180 via the absorption effect in liquid channel 30.\n\n[0035] The membrane 45 pores are filled with vaporized refrigerant evaporated from the refrigerant channel 40 while the solution is constrained inside the narrow solution flow channel 50 by the membrane 45 due to its selective perme- ation characteristics. The feed solution flows inside the solution channel 50, and the vaporized refrigerant is driven to the feed solution for absorption by the partial vapor pressure difference. Apart from enhanced heat/mass transfer, this reactor geometry also makes the energy storage system more resistant to mechanical shock and less sensitive to orientation.\n\n[0036] The solution (refrigerant/absorbent mixture) of the energy storage system can be various, including H,O-based solutions, NH,-based solutions, alcohol-based solutions, hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-based solutions, hydrofluo- roolefin (HFO)-based solutions, CO,-based solutions, and other solutions. In these solutions, the absorbent can be salt, hydroxide, water, ionic liquid, or other inorganic/organic absorbents. In addition, the refrigerant can be pure refrig- erant or blend refrigerant, and the absorbent can be pure absorbent or blend absorbent.\n\nMar. 9, 2023\n\n[0037] Another embodiment of a membrane-based reactor is shown in FIG. 5. The FIG. 5 reactor 200 includes at least five channels, a solution channel 250, a refrigerant channel 240, two fluid channels 220 and 230, and a vapor channel 242. The additional vapor channel 242 can eliminate heat conduction between the solution channel 250 and the refrig- erant channel 240, avoiding heat interference with each other. Accordingly, two layers of membrane 245, 246 and two layers of hollow support plate 247, 248 are used.\n\n[0038] FIG. 6 depicts a thermochemical energy storage system 300 that includes the membrane-based thermochemi- cal reactor with a vapor channel 200 of FIG. 5. The charging process of the modified system is shown in FIG. 6. The operation process is similar to that of the system shown ln FIG. 2; the difference is that the vaporized refrigerant generated from the solution channel 250 initially passes through membrane 246 to enter the vapor channel 242, and then passes through membrane 245 to enter the refrigerant channel 240, and finally gets condensed in the refrigerant channel 240.\n\n[0039] The cold discharging and heat discharging pro- cesses of the 5-channel reactor-based system 300 are respec- tively shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. The operation processes are substantially similar to those shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4; the difference is that the vaporized refrigerant evaporated from the refrigerant channel 240 initially passes through membrane 245 to enter the vapor channel 242, and then passes through membrane 246 to enter the solution channel 250, and finally gets absorbed in the solution channel 250.\n\n[0040] The microchannel membrane-based reactor is com- pared to other types of reactors, including plate heat exchanger reactors, horizontal falling-film reactors, and ver- tical falling-film reactors. FIG. 9 compares the absorption/ desorption rate, while FIG. 10 compares the coefficient of performance. These FIGS. demonstrate that the microchan- nel membrane-based thermochemical energy storage sys- tems of the present invention can outperform existing ther- mochemical energy storage systems while being more compact, more efficient, and having lower charging tem- perature.\n\n[0041] The foregoing description of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and description.
