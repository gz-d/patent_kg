Each of the antenna units includes a planar dipole antenna arranged on the substrate; a loop antenna arranged on the substrate and operably connected with the planar dipole antenna; and a feed net- work for connection with a feed source. The feed network is operably connected with the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna for feeding an electrical signal from the feed source to the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna so as to form an electric dipole at the planar dipole antenna and. a magnetic dipole at the loop antenna. The planar dipole antenna, the loop antenna and/or the feed network may be formed by conductive strips (e.g., Copper strips).
