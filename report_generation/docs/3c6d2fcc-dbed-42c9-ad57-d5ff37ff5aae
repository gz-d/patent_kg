In particular, the monomeric units form a self-assembly polymer. The present invention also relates to a method of preparing a composition, and a method of killing or controlling the growth of microorgan- isms.\n\n[0010] In one embodiment, the cyclic group is a 6 mem- bered aryl group and R has a structure of Formula (IIa):\n\nFormula (Ia) Ry Ro aoe Rs Ry\n\nBACKGROUND OF INVENTION\n\n[0002] Compositions that are capable of directional and reversible intermolecular self-assembly are of great interest and can be effective candidates for antimicrobial coatings due to their superior biocompatibility and antimicrobial capability.

However, these materials lack selectivity and can inhibit and kill pathogenic microbes as well as normal cells in the human body, qualities which are detrimental to, and limit, wide practical application. These materials also tend to inevitably suffer from damage during use, which reduces service life and increases costs remarkably.\n\n[0013] R,, Ry, Rs and R, are independently selected from the group consisting of (i) a linear or branched alkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkenyl group, optionally com- prising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkyny. group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (ii) a cycloalkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroa- tom; (iii) an aryl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (iv) a heteroatom; and (v) a hydrogen atom; and\n\nqualities such as strong mechanical, antimicrobial and pro- longed release properties are desired.\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n[0005] A first aspect of the present invention relates to a composition comprising one or more monomeric units hav- ing a structure of Formula (1), and wherein the one or more monomeric units encapsulate a hydrophobic material.\n\n[0014] the dotted line denotes no double bonds, one double bond, two double bonds, or three double bonds in the cyclic group.\n\nSNH oO 0 \u548c \u592a \u548c \u548c \u548c \u548c \u87ec \u7ad9 TY Ne.

The cyclic group may be aromatic or non-aromatic.\n\n[0078] As used herein, \u201ccomprising\u201d means including the following elements but not excluding others. \u201cEssentially consisting of\u2019 means that the material consists of the respec- tive element along with usually and unavoidable impurities such as side products and components usually resulting from the respective preparation or method for obtaining the material such as traces of further components or solvents. \u201cConsisting of\u201d means that the material solely consists of, i.e. is formed by the respective element.\n\n[0086] The term \u201csubstituted\u201d as used herein includes all substituents of compounds permissible in the context of the chemical rules of valence known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some cases, substituted may generally refer to replacement of a hydrogen atom with a substituent as\n\n[0079] present provides a composition includes one or more monomeric units.

The one or more monomeric units encapsulates a hydrophobic material.\n\n[0081] nis an integer indicating the number of methylene bridges, i.e. \u2014CH,\u2014 groups, and is preferably selected from 1 to 5, more preferably selected from 1, 2, 3 or 4, further preferred from 2, 3 or 4 and in particular embodi- ments of the present invention, n is 3. For example, if n is 1, there is one methylene bridge present at the respective position.\n\n[0087] The term \u201chydrophobic material\u201d as used herein relates to a material that repels water. Hydrophobic materials are generally non-polar. The hydrophobicity of a material may be determined by measuring water immiscibility and water solubility. Hydrophobic materials are generally water immiscible and insoluble in water. The hydrophobicity of a material, particularly solid materials, may also be deter- mined by measuring water contact angles, i.e. wherein a liquid-vapour interface meets a solid surface. If a water contact angle on the solid surface is larger than 90 degrees, the solid surface is considered hydrophobic.\n\nmeric units can connect to each other to form a network or networks that define a core structure or backbone of the composition. The term \u201cconnect\u201d encompasses any type of interaction which allows the formation of a network as described herein, and includes, without limitation, nonco- valent bonding, for example, hydrogen bonds, metal-ligand interactions, pi interactions, ionic bonds, Van de Waals interactions, hydrophobic bonds, other reversible interac- tions and the like, and covalent bonding. In an example, the one or more monomeric units connect to each other via a host-guest interaction through non-covalent bonding that maintains the 3D structure of the one or more monomeric units. In an embodiment herein, the monomeric unit forms at least one hydrogen bond with adjacent monomeric unit, thereby forming a crosslinked network. In another example embodiment, the one or more monomeric units repeat con- tinuously in a linear fashion to form a network.

Particularly, the inventors have found that varying the amount of essen- tial oil in the composition can vary the mechanical strength of the composition and the hydrophobic material, particu- larly the essential oil, affect the mechanical strength by disrupting weak hydrogen bond crosslinks. Thus, the hydro- phobic material disrupts bonding in the monomeric units while at the same time forms non-covalent linkage with the monomeric units.

(UPy-NCO),Priamine. (UPy-NCO),Priamine was obtained by reacting 2 equiva- lents of UPy-NCO and 1 equivalent of priamine 1074. A 500-mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux cooler was charged with priamine 1074 (1.593 g, 3 mmol) and DMSO (150 mL), then UPy-NCO (1.758 g, 6 mmol) was added drop wise. After reacting at 90\u00b0 C. under the protec- tion of nitrogen for 6 hours, the solvent DMSO was removed, and the solid product was washed 3 times with 60 mL portions of acetone. (UPy-NCO),Priamine was then collected by centrifugation and dried overnight under high vacuum at 60\u00b0 C.\n\n[0129] It would be appreciated that the present invention also pertains to a kit comprising the composition described above as well as use of the composition medical purposes such as topical administration.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1A\n\n[0137] Preparation of Composition of the Present Inven- tion\n\nMolecular Design of the Composition\n\n[0130] The claimed invention relates, in one aspect, to a composition comprising one or more monomeric units encapsulating a hydrophobic material. In one embodiment, the monomeric unit consists of a dimer diamine end-capped with ureidopyrimidinone (UPy). The inventors unexpectedly found that the composition of the present invention can be constructed through polymerization and intermolecular crosslinks, wherein a hierarchical hydrogen-bond cross- linked network can facilitate the composition with high mechanical strength and fast healing properties.\n\n[0138] 1 equivalent of (UPy-NCO),Priamine powder was stirred and dissolved in 2 equivalent carvacrol at 80\u00b0 C. and evaporated at room temperature for 12 hours to promote full network formation. Preparation of compositions with dif- ferent weight ratios of monomeric units and hydrophobic material were prepared according to the method described above and are summarised in Table 1 below. UP denotes monomeric unit (UPy-NCO),Priamine, C denotes hydro- phobic material, particularly essential oil.\n\n[0131] Ureidopyrimidinone motifs were found to form strong quadruple hydrogen bonds that promote linear chain extension and advantageously enable monomeric properties. Weak hydrogen bond interactions between urea units were found to provide intermolecular crosslinks between the monomeric backbones. The introduction of a hydrophobic material, for example carvacrol, into the one or more mono- meric unit network disrupted the weak hydrogen bond crosslinks and facilitated the formation of a gel-like com- position. The inventors beneficially found that the content of hydrophobic material, particularly carvacrol in this example, could be controlled to regulate the mechanical strength of the composition.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nWeight ratio of different samples of the composition of the present invention Composition Weight Ratio (UP:C) UP|-Co 1:0 UP)-Cy Ll UPi-C2 12 UP\\-Cs 15\n\nExample 1C\n\n[0132] FIG. 1 illustrates the monomeric unit in accordance with an example embodiment. The monomeric unit is end- capped by a ureidopyrimidinone dimer (shown in L-shaped blocks), which is associated and dissociated under certain stimuli, enabling self-healing of the composition when dam- aged and directional and reversible intermolecular self- assembly. Strong quadruple bond hydrogen bonding between the ureidopyrimidinone is represented by the L-shaped blocks, weak hydrogen bonding interactions between urea motifs in the one or more monomeric units is shown in cylindrical blocks, and hydrophobic material mol- ecules, particularly carvacrol oil molecules in a one embodi- ment, is shown in spherical blocks. The arrow illustrates the advantageous self-assembly of the one or more monomeric units and hydrophobic material form the composition.\n\nMechanical and Self-Healing Analysis\n\n[0139] For mechanical tensile-stress and self-healing tests, sample size of 30 mm lengthx6 mm widthx3 mm height, gauge length of 10 mm, and strain rate of 10 mm/min were adopted.\n\n[0140] The tests were repeated at least three times and the average values were recorded. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted on TA instruments (Q800 DMA). For self-healing tests, the polymer film was cut into two pieces and then put together. Healing tests on various samples can be conducted at different conditions. The healed samples followed the same procedure to obtain the tensile stress- strain curves. Rheology tests of gels were carried out by using Malvern Kinexus Lab* implemented with a 20-mm diameter parallel plate. The gap in the setup for rheological testing of the gels was 1.0 mm. Frequency sweeps were performed from 0.01 rad/s to 100 rad/s. Temperature sweeps conducted from 20\u00b0 C. 100\u00b0 C.\n\nExample 1B\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n[0141] FIG. 2 shows the results of a nano-indentation test to test the mechanical tensile-stress of samples of the composition. For UP,-C,, i.e. composition comprising a weight ratio of 1 monomeric unit to 0 hydrophobic material, particularly carvacrol, a Young\u2019s moduli 1.44 GPa reflected a very high stiffness.

FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate in-situ microscope photographs of the UP,-C, sample at different time points. FIGS. 4B and 4C show the sample at 20 minutes and 40 minutes, respectively, at 80\u00b0 C. The results show that the self-healing efficiency of the composition increases with time. Heating the composi- tion to 70\u00b0 C. also significantly accelerates the healing process, which correlates with the rheological and DMA analysis showing that the modulus of the composition decreases above this temperature.\n\n[0153] Compared to the control sample UP,-C, (FIG. 7C and FIG. 7F), the composition comprising one or more monomeric units and hydrophobic material, i.e. essential oil in this embodiment, exhibited anti-bacterial ability to gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria. Bactericidal ability of the composition also positively correlated with the content of essential oil in the composition. When FIGS. 7A-7C were compared with FIGS. 7D-7F, samples of the composition at the same concentration appear to have a stronger bacteri- cidal effect on gram-positive bacteria when compared with gram-negative bacteria.\n\nhealing times was also conducted and is illustrated in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6. The healing efficiency of the sample at 40 minutes was 96.5% relative to pristine sample, potentially attributable to the chain motion and dynamic hydrogen bonding association.\n\n[0154] Time Dependent Disinfection Efficiency\n\n[0155] 1 cmxl cm glass slides coated with varying amounts of essential oil, particularly carvacrol, UP,-C,, UP,-C, or UPi-Cs (10 mg of each coating) were immersed in 1 mL S. aureus or E. coli solution in 24 well plates. Every thirty minutes the bacteria solution was mixed by vortex an 100 wL aliquots of the bacteria samples were removed, anc used for serial dilution on agar plates. The appropriate numbers of colonies formed were counted and the tota amount of bacteria in the solution was calculated. The experiment was performed independently three times.\n\n[0145] FIG. 9 is a table showing properties of samples of the composition with different amounts of hydrophobic material, i.e. UPi-Co, UP,-C,, UP,-C;. The mechanical properties of the composition samples studied include maxi- mum stress, maximum strain, Young\u2019s modulus-tensile test, storage modulus G'-0.1 rad/s, Young\u2019s modulus-indentation, and glass transition temperature (T,).\n\n[0156] FIG. 8A illustrates time-dependent antimicrobia: activity of sample UP, -Cs and UP,-C, towards S. aureus by analysis of reduction of colony forming units (CFU). FIG. 8B illustrates time-dependent antimicrobial activity o: sample UP,-C, and UP,-C; towards E. coli by analysis o: reduction of CFU. The results illustrated that UP,-C, and UP,-Cs were able to reduce S. aureus and FE. coli colony forming units by more than 5 orders of magnitude after 90 min, corresponding to more than 99.999% reducing effi- ciency.\n\n[0146] FIG. 10 is a scatter diagram showing the frequency sweep in rheology measurement for monomeric units assembled in thymol oil. Over the entire range of frequen- cies storage modulus (GO is higher than loss modulus (G\"), illustrating solid-like properties. FIG. 10 also advanta- geously shows thymol oil as an effective hydrophobic mate- rial for encapsulation in the one or more monomeric units.\n\n[0147] FIG. 11 is a line graph showing samples of the composition with two different amounts of hydrophobic material, i.e. UPi-Co and UP,-C,, display good transmit- tance as high as 90% in the visible region.\n\n[0157] These results showed the superior antimicrobia. ability of the composition of the present invention.\n\n[0148] advantageously varying content of hydrophobic material in the composition can be used to alter or control the mechanical strength of the composition, and that the composition exhibits self-healing characteristics.\n\nExample 1E\n\nRelease of Carvacrol Encapsulated in Composition in Air or Underwater\n\nExample 1D\n\n[0158] The amount of carvacrol, i.e. the hydrophobic material in the composition, released in air was calculated weight loss and is illustrated in FIG. 8C.

The cumulative release of carvacrol from the composition samples could last for up to 60 days, demon- strating controlled or sustained release properties of carvac- rol when encapsulated into the composition samples. This may be attributed to the strong noncovalent interactions between carvacrol oil and the one or more monomeric units. Thus, the composition of the present invention shows strong prolonged release behavior this providing a highly advan- tageous composition with wide applicability, such as in the preparation of sustained release dosage forms for various medical purposes.\n\nFormula (Ia) Ri Ro \u201c co) * Rs Ry\n\nin which:\n\nR, and R, are independently selected from the group consisting of (i) a linear or branched alkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkenyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom: a linear or branched alkynyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (ii) a cycloalkyl group optionally comprising a heteroatom; (iii) an aryl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; and.

The composition has been shown to display mechanical robustness, fast healing, strong adhesiveness and sustained release antibiotic properties. Based on the supramolecular polymerization and polymer chains cross- linked networks, hierarchical hydrogen-bond interactions enable high mechanical strength and fast healing at elevated temperatures. Specifically, strong quadruple hydrogen bonds enable the polymerization of monomeric units, and weak intermolecular hydrogen bond contribute to the crosslinks and aggregations of the monomeric units. Carvacrol oil has been shown to readily affect the mechanical strength of the composition through damage to the intermolecular weak hydrogen bonding.
