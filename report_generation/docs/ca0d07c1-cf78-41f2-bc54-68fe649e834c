Power adaptors (or AC-DC power converters) are traditionally used to charge the batteries in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic prod- ucts, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable electronic equipment.\n\npatent application GB2399225A generates an AC electro- magnetic flux with the flux lines 102 flowing \u201chorizontally\u201d along the charging surfaces 102 as shown in FIG. la. A distributed winding is used in this charging platform for gen- erating the AC flux. This principle is in fact similar to the AC electromagnetic flux generated in a cylindrical motor, except that the cylindrical structure is compressed into a flat pancake shape. As the flux needs to flow horizontally along the upper and lower surfaces, two inherent limitations arise. Firstly, an electromagnetic flux guide must be used to guide the flux along the bottom surface. This is usually a layer of soft mag- netic material such as ferrite or amorphous alloy. In order to provide sufficient flux, this layer must be \u201cthick\u201d enough so that the flux can pass along the layer of soft magnetic material without magnetic saturation. Secondly, a similar problem applies to the secondary device that has to pick up flux (and energy) on the upper surface of the charging platform. FIG. 16 shows the device required for the charging platform of FIG. 1a. It consists of a magnetic core 104 and a winding 106. In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area 108. Therefore, this cross-sec- tional area must be large enough so that enough flux and energy can be picked up by the secondary device. It should be noted that this secondary device must be housed inside the electronic equipment to be charged on the charging platform. The thickness of the secondary device is crucial to the appli-\n\nplanes as shown in FIG. 3, it has been shown that both energy and signal can be transferred from one planar winding to another. This planar PCB transformer technology has been applied in a range of applications. In 2004, it was used for a contactless battery charger for mobile phones (Choi B., Nho J., Cha H. and Choi 8.:, \u2018Design and implementation of low- profile contactless battery charger using planar printed circuit board windings as energy transfer device\u2019, JEEE Transac- tions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 51, No. 1, February 2004, pp. 140-147). Choi uses one planar winding 400 as a primary charging pad and a separate planar winding 402 as a second- ary winding as shown in FIGS. 4a and 44. FIG. 5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit diagram 500 of this contactless charging system. It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described by Hui and Tang, while the front power stage of the secondary circuit is a standard winding with a diode rectifier that provides the rec-\n\nTwo main problems suffered by the prior art charging of FIG. 5 include:\n\nAnother planar inductive battery charging platform was proposed in WO03/105308. Unlike GB2399225A, the charg- ing platform 200 proposed in WO03/105308 uses a multi- layer planar winding array to generate an AC flux that has almost uniform magnitude over the entire charging surface. The lines of flux 204 of this charging platform flow \u201cperpen- dicularly\u201d in and out of the charging surfaces (FIG. 2).

The soft magnetic sheet may be, for example, square, rectangular or other polygonal shapes as shown in FIG. 11(a), or may be circular or oval as shown in FIG. 11(6). The winding and soft magnetic sheet form an energy pick-up coil or inductor as shown in FIG. 11(a) or 11(6), which then forms a resonant tank with the small resonant capacitor. When sensing a high-frequency AC magnetic flux flowing perpendicularly (or vertically) from the surface of the planar inductive battery charging platform, the energy pick-up coil will develop an AC voltage by Faraday\u2019s law and picks up the energy transmitted from a planar charg- ing platform. This coil enclosing the soft magnetic sheet (as a low-profile magnetic core) is essentially a planar inductor. This planar inductor and the series-connected AC capacitor form a series resonant tank that can amplify the AC voltage for the diode rectifier.

Most battery chargers for mobile phones provide a DC voltage of 4-6V. The functional block diagram 600 of a power adapter is shown in FIG. 6. When the power adaptor is plugged into the electronic equip- ment (to be charged), the two outputs DC+ 602 and DC- 604 are connected to the mechanical contacts of the charger socket of the electronic equipment.\n\nIn order to effectively pick up the perpendicular AC mag- netic flux generated by the planar inductive charging platform of FIG. 2, a planar winding 1100 with a certain number of turns (e.g., 12 turns) in the secondary module is wound. around a thin sheet of soft magnetic material (1102, 1104) as shown in FIGS. 11(a) and 11(4). The height of this winding is Jess than the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet. This thin or low-profile structure can be placed or glued, for example, on the active side of the battery inside the battery pack. The thin soft magnetic sheet serves as a magnetic core for the winding and guides the perpendicular AC magnetic flux (generated by the charging platform) through the winding. It should be noted that the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet can be very small (e.g., 0.5 mm) because the cross-sectional area for the magnetic flux to flow is the large flat surface of the soft sheet the flux lines flow\n\nFIG. 7 depicts a battery pack 700 with several external mechanical contacts (e.g., contact 702) that are accessible. Inside the battery pack are the electric \u201ccells\u201d 704 and a \u201ccharging protection circuit\u201d 706 as shown in FIG. 8. Two mechanical contacts 702 and 708 are connected to the posi- tive and negative terminals of the battery through the charging protection circuit. The cells form the battery and the charging protection circuit ensures that the battery is charged in a specified manner.

This highlights the huge advantage of the perpendicular flux generation of the induc- tive battery charging platform of WO03/105308 over the horizontal flux generation of GB2399225A. The \u201cthin\u201d struc- ture of the proposed device of the present invention makes it easy to modify existing battery packs without substantially increasing the thickness of the battery pack. This makes it attractive for \u201clow-profile\u201d portable electronic equipment such as mobile phones.\n\nuse capacitor a designer the freedom to select the appropriate operating fre- quency for the entire charging system in order to optimize the system performance for meeting various requirements and international standards. It has been explained in WO03/ 105308 that the primary circuit (ie. equivalent circuit of the inductive battery charging platform) is essentially a L-C reso- nant circuit. By choosing the resonant frequencies of both primary and secondary resonant circuits to be identical or as close as possible, energy transfer between them can be opti- mized. With the use of a core-based planar inductor in this proposal, the inductance value of Lr can be much greater than that of a coreless spiral winding as in the prior art. Therefore, according to the above equation, the resonant frequencies of both of the primary and secondary circuit can be selected at a relatively low frequency range (e.g. 100 kHz to 450 kHz) instead of 950 kHz as in the case of the prior art.\n\nIt should be noted that while the present invention is par- ticularly suited for use with the battery charging platform of W003/105308 it is not limited to use with that platform and. could be used with any battery charging platform in which the lines of flux extend generally perpendicular to the charging surface.\n\nplanar winding 11(a) and 11(4) is shown in FIGS. 12(a) and 12(4). A sec- ondary energy receiving element may be added to the first energy receiving element. In particular, additional spiral windings can be added (connected in parallel) to the pick-up coil (i.e. the first winding that encloses the soft magnetic core) by printing one or more spiral windings 1200 on a printed circuit board (PCB) 1202 that is placed on top of a magnetic sheet 1204. The PCB is placed on the side of the magnetic sheet that in use would face the primary winding(s). It should also be noted that the PCB can be very thin (e.g., 0.2 mm) so the combination of the PCB and the magnetic sheet is stil very thin. By connecting (1214) terminal 1208 of the addi- tional winding to terminal 1206 of the first winding 1207, and connecting (1216) terminal 1212 of the additional winding to terminal 1210 of the first winding, as shown in FIG. 124, the two windings are connected in parallel. The extra planar winding(s) can improve the energy pick-up in the secondary\n\ntronic equipment has the active side of the battery pack near and parallel to the charging surface of the charging platform, which produces a magnetic flux flowing in and out of the charging surface perpendicularly. By Faraday\u2019s law, an AC voltage will be induced in the secondary winding. In this invention, the two terminals of the secondary resonant tank are connected to a diode rectifier and a capacitor as shown in FIG. 13. The use of this diode rectifier and a smoothing capacitor is important. Firstly, the diode rectifier turns the induced AC voltage in the winding into a rectified DC voltage and the DC capacitor reduces the AC voltage ripple so that a fairly constant DC voltage can be made available for the charging protection circuit. Secondly, the diode rectifier pre- vents any current from flowing into the secondary resonant tank 1400 formed by Lr and Cr when a traditional battery charger is plugged into the charged equipment. This feature can be explained with the use of the block diagram as shown in FIG, 14. As the introduction of the proposed inductive charging device should not affect the use of a traditional power adaptor, it is important that the new circuit should allow the electronic equipment to be charged by both a planar inductive charging platform and a traditional power adaptor. Ifa traditional power adaptor 1402 is plugged into the charg- ing socket of the electronic equipment, the terminals DC+ 1404 and DC- 1406 will be connected to IN+ 1408 and IN- 1410 of the battery pac the charging socket. TI through the mechanical contacts in he presence of the diode rectifier is crucial here because it prevents any current from the tradi- tional power adaptor from flowing into the \u201csecondary wind-\n\nIt should also be noted that a coil formed on a printed circuit board in addition to acting as a secondary energy receiving element in the abovedescribed embodiment, may alternatively serve as a single energy receiving element on its own.\n\npick up a sufficiently large voltage from the primary circuit at high frequency (950 kHz). The use of such high frequency leads to many shortcomings such as high AC resistance in the windings, reduced energy efficiency, high switching losses and high EMI emission in both primary and secondary cir- cuits. Unlike the standard secondary winding used in this prior art, the winding of the present invention (FIGS. 11 and. 12) serves as both an energy pick-up coil and a resonant inductor (Lr). A small AC capacitor (Cr) is connected in series (or possibly in parallel in FIG. 13 (FIG. 135 ) with this coil (an inductor) as shown shows a circuit diagram 1311 of FIG. 13a) to form a resonant tank, which is then connected to the diode rectifier with a DC capacitor (Cdc). The diode rectifier turns the resonant AC voltage picked up by the resonant tank into a DC voltage and the DC capacitor reduces the voltage ripple in order to maintain a fairly stiff DC voltage for the charging circuit. It should be noted that the diode rectifier can be of a standard type as shown in FIG. 13(4), or it can be of a type 1312 with voltage doubling (sometimes called voltage doubler) as shown in FIG. 13(c). The use of a voltage regu-\n\nA further proposal in this invention is to incorporate the resonant capacitor Cr, the diode rectifier and the DC capacitor Cdc into the existing charging protection circuit as shown in FIG. 15. In this way, the two terminals 1500, 1502 of the secondary winding can simply be connected to the inputs of the modified charging protection circuit 1504. The DC power terminals 1506, 1508 of a traditional power adaptor or charger, if used, will be connected to IN+ 1510 and IN- 1512 of the modified circuit as usual (FIG. 15).
