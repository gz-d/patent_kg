In addition, neither do these techniques may be adopted for coating bulk Ag materials with topological nanostructure surface.\n\n[0030] In one aspect of the present invention, the voltage or current waveform is square-shaped, triangular-shaped, or sinusoidal-shaped.\n\n[0050] Furthermore, although Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) was first found in the electrochemi- cally roughened silver, it has been notoriously difficult to obtain SERS substrates with both high sensitivity and hig! uniformity, which severely hampered their commercializa- tion. Therefore, silver with topological nanostructure surface attracted increased interest in various fields.\n\n[0031] In one aspect of the present invention, the metallic structure is in the form of a wire, a foil, a mash, a foam, structure or a needle.\n\n[0032] In one aspect of the present invention, the metallic structure is a substrate for Surface Enhanced Raman Spec- troscopy (SERS), sensing, catalysis, therapeutics or plasmo- electronics.\n\n[0051] The present invention relates to a facile and robust electrochemical method which bestows Ag metals with nanostructured surface based on the pulse electrochemical techniques in a one-pot one-step manner. Metal nanostruc- tures are constructed at Ag substrate at nanoscale throug! rapid pulse electrochemistry and as a result, the Ag substrate is evenly coated by various metal nanomaterials. The whole procedure may be carried out in a typical three electrode aqueous system using pulse electrochemistry at ambient conditions. The compositions and specific texture of the thus-created surface is well controlled through adjusting the electrochemical parameters and the electrolyte recipes. Thus, the present invention shows great potential for large scale production.\n\n[0033] It is an object of the present invention to address the above needs, to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages or, more generally, to provide an improved method for treating a surface of a metallic struc- ture, and in particular, a needle made of noble metals.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0034] Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accom- panying drawings in which:\n\n[0035] FIG. la is a flow diagram showing a schematic illustration of fabrication procedure for nanostructuring bulk Ag in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;\n\n[0052] Referring initially to FIG. 1a, there is provided a method for treating a surface of a metallic structure 10, the metallic structure 10 being made of a first metallic material, the method comprising the steps of: (a) releasing metallic ions 12 from the surface of the metallic structure 10; and (b) depositing a nano-structured metallic layer 20 onto the surface of the metallic structure 10 from the released metal- lic ions 12, wherein the nano-structured metallic layer 20 includes uniform nanoparticles 22.\n\n[0036] FIG. 14 is a schematic diagram showing the sur- face texture modification of Ag needle with a pulse potential method in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;\n\n[0037] FIG. 1c depicts the tuning surface texture of Ag needle from (b) by altering time frames of the pulse;\n\n[0038] FIG. 1d provides SEM images of the surface tex- ture of Ag needle treated with a typical pulse current method;\n\n[0053] The metallic structure 10 may be embodied various forms such as a wire, a foil, a mash, a foam, a porous structure or a needle.

The electrolyte is an\n\nsize distribution chart depicted in FIGS . 2c and 2d , the\n\naqueous solution of 0.1 M nitric acid .\n\naverage size of silver particles 22 is reduced from 310 nm\n\n[ 0062 ] A voltage / current waveform is then applied to the\n\n( size of nanoparticles 24 ) to 75 nm ( size of nanoparticles 25 )\n\nelectrochemical cell throughout the electrochemical process .\n\nwith relative standard error dropped from 27.1 to 13.5 % .\n\nMay 6, 2021\n\nUS 2021/0130973 Al\n\nIllustratively, the voltage/current waveform consists of peri- odically modulated potential/current between two extreme values for n cycles: a potential/current of Pi /I, for a time duration oft for oxidizing Ag structure 10 to release the Ag jon (Ag*) 12, and a potential/current of P./I, for a time duration of t, for reducing the released Ag ion (Ag*) 12 into Ag nanoparticles 22.\n\nstructured metallic layer 20 onto the metallic structure 10, the metallic structure 10 is subjected to electrochemical treatment under a periodically modulated potential. In par- ticular, the electrochemical treatment involves the alternat- ing electrochemical oxidation and reduction of the metallic structure 10, which may be triggered by applying different first and second voltages or currents to the metallic structure 10 for first and second durations e.g. time ranges from 0.001 s to 7200 s respectively for a number of cycles e.g. 10-15000 cycles. The first voltage is a positive or zero voltage and the second voltage is a negative voltage. For instance, the first voltage may be OV and the second voltage may be -8V.\n\n[0063] In particular, a pulsed voltage waveform is applied for over 1000 cycles with each cycle consisting of two steps: 0 V (oxidation) for tens of microseconds for releasing the Ag ion (Ag*) 12 in step 102, followed by -0.8 V (reduction) for tens of microseconds to deposit Ag nanoparticles 22 in step 104. Uniform and densely packed Ag nanoparticles in the form of nanospheres 22 with average diameters of 310 nm are then produced at the surface of SAN 10 and deposited as a nano-structured Ag layer 20 as depicted in FIG. 15.\n\n[0057] Preferably, the voltages or currents waveform may be in the form of square-shaped, triangular-shaped, sinusoi- dal-shaped or other profiles in which the first and second voltages or currents would remain constant in each cycle. The size of the nanoparticles 20 would be determined by the selection of the applied first and second voltages or currents and corresponding duration.\n\n[0064] In sharp contrast to conventional roughening tech- niques, during the ultrashort oxidation step 102, Ag ion (Ag*) 12 released tends to reside in close contact with the surface of the SAN 10 i.e. the stern layer 30, rather than enters the diffusion layer 40 where they would be unevenly distributed, and thus contributes to the narrow size distri- bution of Ag nanospheres 22 formed in the reduction step 104. On the other hand, the ultrashort reduction step 104 prohibits overgrowth of silver nuclei, which facilitates the formation of uniform and densely packed Ag nanosphere films 20. Naturally, the resultant morphologies are tailorable by modulating the oxidation and reduction steps 102 and 104 respectively.\n\n[0058] In one exemplary configuration, the electrochemi- cal treatment of the metallic structure 10 may be performed in an electrochemical cell having a working electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte in electrical connection. Optionally, the electrochemical cell may also include a reference electrode, which serves for voltage measurement purpose. A metallic structure 10 made of a first metallic material is used as working electrode and a wire made of a second metallic material is connected to the counter elec- trode respectively. The solution of the electrolyte is an acid and preferably a diluted acid solution such as nitric acid or citric acid.\n\n[0065] Advantageously, the dimensions and density of Ag nanosphere 22, i.e., the morphology at the surface 20 of the SAN 10, can be precisely controlled in the range from ~100 to 600 nm as depicted in FIG. lc through altering the electrochemical parameters (e.g., P,, Ps, t, and t,). Four SEM images of nanosphere 22 with different dimensions are depicted in FIG. 1c, with scale bars indicate 2 hm and 500 nm for the low and high magnification images respectively.\n\n[0059] The resultant surface nanotexture and ingredients of the nano-structured metallic layer 20 may be further tuned by the presence of additives in the electrolytes. For instance, the electrolyte may further include an additive that may alter the size of the nanoparticles 22 forming the nano-structured metallic layer 20. The additive may be acid, or metal salts. For instance, the cations of the metal salts may be Cu**, Ni?*, Co?*, Fe**, or Fe** and the anions of the metal salts may be NO,~, SO,\u00b0>, CI\u2019, or Br-. The additive may also be water soluble polymer e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), or other compounds such as sodium salts e.g. citrate sodium, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), polysalts e.g. polystyrene sulfonate, or cysteine.\n\n[0066] When a SAN 10 with a small content of Cu is subjected to the electrochemical treatment and cycled under galvanostatic mode i. constant current, for instance, between 20 mA (I,) and -20 mA (I,) with dwell time of several seconds for over 100 cycles, in an aqueous solution of 0.05 M citric acid, ultralong ordered Cu nanowires 23 as depicted in FIG. 1d are formed on the surface of the SAN 10.\n\n[0060] In each cycle, the metallic atoms of the metallic structure 10 are first oxidized to metallic ions 12 and released from the surface of the metallic structure 10 during oxidation stage. In the same cycle, the released metallic ions 12 are then reduced to metallic atoms 22 and form the nano-structured metallic layer 20 at the surface of the metallic structure 10 during reduction stage.\n\n[0067] Optionally, various Ag nanoparticles, such as Ag nanocubes 31, nanopyramids 32, nanospheres 33, nanocones as depicted in the SEM images of FIG. le may also be obtained by centrifugation of resultant electrolytes after the electrochemical treatment.\n\n[0061] In one example embodiment as shown in FIG. 1a, the metallic structure 10 is embodied as a Silver acupuncture needle (SAN) that is suitable for the surface treatment method 100 of the present invention. The SAN 10 is washed via sonication sequentially in acetone, ethanol, and water, each for 15 minutes. Afier dried under a steam of nitrogen, the SAN is used as the working electrode of the electro- chemical cell. On the other hand, a platinum wire acts as the counter electrode and a silver/silver sulfate electrode acts as the reference electrode respectively. The electrolyte is an aqueous solution of 0.1 M nitric acid.\n\n[0068] In one alternative embodiment, citric acid is added into electrolyte as additive while the other experimental conditions in the previous example embodiment remained unchanged, nanoparticles 24 of the structured metallic layer 20 formed by electrolyte without additive and nanoparticles 25 of the structured metallic layer 20 formed by electrolyte with additive are depicted in FIGS. 2a and 25 respectively, with scale bars indicate 2 hm for the low magnification images and 500 nm for insets respectively. Comparing the size distribution chart depicted in FIGS. 2c and 2d, the average size of silver particles 22 is reduced from 310 nm (size of nanoparticles 24) to 75 nm (size of nanoparticles 25) with relative standard error dropped from 27.1 to 13.5%.\n\n[0062] A voltage/current waveform is then applied to the electrochemical cell throughout the electrochemical process.\n\n34\n\nMay 6 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0130973 A1\n\n4\n\nmentally friendly and amendable to mass production , which\n\nThus , the particle size of the nanostructure 22 can be\n\nhold great potential for fundamental investigation and prac\n\nmanipulated by the relative content of the additive within the\n\ntical applications .\n\nelectrolyte .\n\n[ 0077 ] Some technical advantages of the embodiments of\n\n[ 0069 ] The dimensions and aggregates status of the nano\n\nthe present invention include :\n\nstructured surface can be actively controlled by electro\n\n[ 0078 ] The whole treatment progress is accomplished in\n\nchemical parameters and electrolytes compositions / recipes .\n\na simple aqueous three electrode system at ambient\n\nAccordingly , the final surface texture and density of the\n\nconditions in a one - pot one - step manner .

Accordingly, the final surface texture and density of the thus-created metal nanoparticles 22 can be conveniently manipulated and altered. This greatly enhances the perfor- mance of the substrate and the Ag-based devices.\n\n[0078] The whole treatment progress is accomplished in a simple aqueous three electrode system at ambient conditions in a one-pot one-step manner. Neither harsh conditions such as vacuum and clean room nor sophis- ticated and expensive control systems which are gen- erally required by other micro-processing technologies are needed.\n\n[0070] In one example embodiment, a pulsed voltage with different potential extremes (P1, P2) are applied to the electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Ag dendrite 26 at nanoscale can be obtained at the surface of the metallic structure 10 as depicted in FIG. 3a and Ag hill-and-valley structure 27 at nanoscale can be obtained at the surface of the metallic structure 10 as depicted in FIG. 36 respectively.\n\n[0079] Silver metals acted as silver resources and deposit substrate at the same time. By contrast, for the previous methods, expensive silver salts are needed.\n\n[0080] morphological uniformity Ag nanostructure is conveniently achieved, due to the localization of Ag* in the stern layer and the suppressed growth of Ag nanoparticles enabled by the pulsed oxidation and reduction.\n\n[0071] In another example embodiment, upon the Cu salts are added into electrolyte during electrochemical oxidation and reduction, grapes-like Cu nanomaterials 28 and verti- cally aligned Cu nanoplates 29 are formed at surface of Ag and as depicted in FIGS. 3c and 3d respectively.\n\n[0081] Fine control of surface nanotextures and com- positions are easily realized by adjusting the electro- chemical parameters and additives in the electrolytes.\n\n[0072] Preferably, Ag metals 10 featuring nanostructured surface 20 is suitable for many different fields, such as energy storage and conversion, sensing, and surface-en- hanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The SERS perfor- mance of SAN obtained from the present invention is evaluated whereas the feasibility and advantages of the invented techniques for nanostructuring the surface of SAN is demonstrated.\n\n[0082] A wide range of metal microstructures such as nanoneedles, nanowires, nanosheets, nanocubes, and nanopores, dendrites, and grapes, can be conveniently fabricated.\n\n[0083] Further/other advantages of the present invention terms of cost, structure, function, ease of manufacture, economics, etc., will become evident to a person skilled art upon reading the above description and the reference drawings.\n\n[0073] In one example embodiment, Ag acupuncture needle (SAN) 10 is treated with the method in accordance with the present invention (P,=0 V, P,=-0.8 V, t,=t,=0.02 s, 1600 cycles). The SANs 10 are readily coated with a layer of densely packed Ag nanospheres 22, which are either uniform in size or at least has a very narrow size distribution.\n\n[0084] Embodiments of the present invention can applied to various applications and fields, for example:\n\n[0085] SERS substrates\n\n[0086] Embodiments of the present invention can be used to produce Ag needle with tailorable advanced nanostructures, making them attractive SERS sub- strates. Especially, such novel SERS substrate can be readily inserted into sample, facilitating sampling pro- cess, which is favorable for fast analysis.\n\n[0074] The treated needle 10 is then applied as an enhanced SERS substrate for trace analysis and detection of 4-nitrothiophenol (4-NTP), a commonly used Raman reporter/label. After soaking in 10-* M 4-NTP for 10 min- utes, Raman signals of 4-NTP absorbed at SAN from different spots on the substrate and the mapping images (2 um stepwise) were recorded, showing excellent reproduc- ibility (FIG. 4). The detection limit was found to be as low as 10-* M. Thus, the present method exhibited a detection limit five orders of magnitude lower and shows enhanced Raman signals with a much improved reproducibility/re- peatability (SD<15%) for trace detection of 4-NTP over untreated ones. Thus, the SERS substrate is conspicuously superior to the common commercial SERS substrates.\n\n[0087] Industrial Catalyst\n\n[0088] Embodiments of the present invention can be used to provide Ag materials with remarkably increased surface volume ratio, i.e. active catalytic sites. This shows a great potential in various catalysis reaction. Furthermore, the metal nanoparticles on silver are free from other surfactants or reductants, reducing reaction activation energy barriers and thus leading to better catalytic efliciency.\n\n[0090] Ag nanoparticles exhibit extraordinary UV-vis light absorption, enabled by surface plasmon reso- nance, which is very promising for solar energy con- version and storage\n\n[0075] These observed remarkable enhancement behav- iors are ascribed to the densely packed Ag nanospheres 22 on the surface 20, which substantially amplify the near electric field, creating a large quantity of hot spots for Raman enhancement. As the \u201chot spots\u201d are evenly distrib- uted on the surface 20, uniform and densely packed Ag nanospheres 22 can be utilized as the sensitive SERS substrate with excellent reproducibility.\n\n[0091] Supercapacitors\n\n[0092] Embodiments of the present invention can be used to provide electrode substrate materials e.g. Ag substrates for supercapacitors.\n\n[0093] Sensors\n\n[0094] Embodiments of the present invention can be used to deliver enhanced performance for nanostruc- tured materials e.g. Ag substrates that are used as electrode in sensors.\n\n[0076] Overall, the SAN 10 with nanostructured surface 20 obtained here is very promising for commercial SERS substrate for rapid and label-free detection.
