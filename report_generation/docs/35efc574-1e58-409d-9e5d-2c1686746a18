The device includes a body having a portion formed with a circumference extending about an axis, a rechargeable battery housed within the body, a first connec- tion circuit in connection with the rechargeable battery dis- posed within the body, and a removable cap adapted to fit over and at least partly surround the body portion. The cap includes an integrally formed secondary winding surrounding the body portion about the axis, the secondary winding being adapted to receive magnetic flux extending from a planar charging surface. The cap further includes a layer of magnetic material disposed between the secondary winding and the body portion for reducing current induced in the body of the electrical device, anda second connection circuit for connect- ing the secondary winding to the first connection circuit so as to charge the rechargeable battery in the body. The cap is arranged to be in contact with the planar charging surface and to support the electrical device on the planar charging surface during charging of the electrical device, and the secondary winding is arranged to be substantially parallel to the planar charging surface so that lines of magnetic flux extending from the planar charging surface pass substantially perpendicu- larly through the secondary winding during charging of the\n\nA disadvantage with such conventional arrangements, however, is that with the proliferation in various types of portable electrical devices most users of such devices have to have a corresponding number of charging adaptors which may be mutually incompatible.

One example of such a wireless platform is described in HUI, Ron, Shu-yuen, International Publication No. WO 03/105308 Al, entitled \u201cPlanar Induc- tive Battery Charger,\u201d published on Dec. 18, 2003 (hereinaf- ter referred to as \u201cWO03/105308\u201d), and which is herein incor- porated by reference in its entirety. In this design, a planar wireless charging platform is proposed upon which devices to be charged may be placed. Underneath the surface of the charging platform there is an array of primary coils that generate lines of magnetic flux that extend generally perpen- dicular to the surface of the charging platform. A device to be charged (for example, a mobile phone) is provided with an integral (or external) secondary coil so that when the device is placed on the charging surface, magnetic flux passes through the secondary coil and generates a voltage therein. The volt- age that is generated may be used to charge the battery within\n\nIn preferred embodiments of the invention the body portion may have a generally circular cross-section and the secondary winding may therefore also be circular. Examples of such products include, for example, a handheld flashlight having a basically circular body and head portion or a camera having a lens portion extending from the camera body. The invention could also, however, be applied to other devices having por- tions with other cross-sections such as oval or square cross- sections. What is critical is that the secondary winding can extend around a circumference of a portion of the device, and that the device can then be placed on the charging surface such that the secondary winding is parallel and close to the charging surface for maximum charging efficiency.\n\nInprinciple, the arrangement disclosed in WO03/105308 is advantageous, since a large number of different devices can be charged (potentially simultaneously) by simply placing the devices on the single charging surface, and consequently the need for multiple charging adaptors can be reduced. In practice, however, there may still be some issues that need addressing for the charging platform of WO03/105308 to gain widespread acceptance. One issue, for example, is use of the charging platform with electrical devices that are not provided with an integral secondary coil. One approach to this is also described in WO03/105308 and uses adaptors that are provided with secondary coils that can receive magnetic flux from the surface of the charging platform and output a DC to conventional socket.\n\nThe secondary winding may be formed either integrally the body portion of the device itself, or may be formed integrally with a cap or other form of protective device that adapted to fit over the body portion.\n\nPreferably, especially if the body of the electrical device is formed of metal either completely or substantially, magnetic\n\nFurthermore, even with electrical devices provided with an integral secondary coil, for certain devices locating a second-\n\nThis application claims priority to United Kingdom Appli-\n\nTo overcome this problem, at least one wireless charging\n\nthe device.\n\nvoltage\n\na\n\ncharging\n\n10\n\n15\n\n30\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n65\n\ncoil in\n\nsuitable\n\nbe easier than it\n\nbe for\n\ncoil will be close to and parallel to the charging surface.\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided an\n\nelectrical device.\n\nwith\n\nis\n\nUS 8,836,278 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nshielding may be provided between the secondary winding\n\nrechargeable batteries (e.g., rechargeable battery 3) that are\n\ndesigned to be charged by the charging platform.

The flashlight 1 is provided with one or more\n\nUS 8,836,278 B2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nshielding may be provided between the secondary winding andthe remainderofthebody ofthe device so as to minimize the amount of flux that passes through the metal body and minimize consequential induction heating in the body.\n\nrechargeable (e.g., rechargeable battery 3) are designed to be charged by the charging platform. The flash- light has a generally cylindrical main body portion 11 that houses the battery, and a head portion 4 that houses the light ulb, reflector and protective glass or plastic (not shown) ina conventional manner. The head portion 4 has a circular cross- section perpendicular to an axis A-A that extends through the head portion 4 and also through the main body portion 3 of the ashlight. It will be seen from FIG. 1 that when the flashlight 1 is to be charged, it is preferably placed on the charging surface 10 vertically so that the flashlight 1 is stood on one end with the head portion 4 of the flashlight contacting the charg- ing surface. In this position, the axis of the flashlight is per- endicular surface.\n\nThe cap is removably fitted over and at least partly surround- ing a body portion of an electrical device, and includes an integrally formed secondary winding surrounding the body portion, the secondary winding being adapted to receive mag- netic flux extending from a planar charging surface, a layer of magnetic material disposed between the secondary winding and the body portion of the electrical device for reducing current induced in the body of the electrical device, and a connection circuit for connecting the secondary winding to the electrical device so as to charge a rechargeable battery in the electrical device. The cap is arranged to be in contact with the planar charging surface and to support the electrical device on the planar charging surface during charging of the electrical device, and the secondary winding is arranged to be substantially parallel to the planar charging surface so that lines of magnetic flux extending from the planar charging surface pass substantially perpendicularly through the sec-\n\ncharging platform, it is necessary to provide a secondary winding (the primary winding is provided as part of the wire- less charging platform) that is adapted to receive magnetic lux from the charging surface 10 and to generate a charging voltage as a consequence of the received magnetic flux pass- ing through the coil. In the example of FIG. 1, a secondary winding 5 is formed integrally with the head portion 4 of the flashlight 1. In particular, the secondary winding 5 comprises at least one coil (and preferably multiple coils) of a conduc- tive material extending around the circumference of the head ortion 4 of the flashlight. In this way, the secondary winding 5 can be formed ina very simple manner and yet be integrated with the structure of the flashlight 1. When the flashlight 1 is stood on the charging surface 10 with the head portion 4 oriented down so that it contacts the charging surface, then the secondary winding 5 will be parallel to the charging surface and close to the charging surface so that the maximum amount of magnetic flux will pass through the secondary winding 5. This will optimize the charging of the recharge- able battery. Suitable circuitry (not shown), including, for example, a DC voltage regulator, may be provided connecting\n\nincludes a cap for an electrical device, the cap being adapted to be removably fitted over and at least partly surround a body portion of an electrical device. Further, the cap includes an integrally formed secondary winding to surround the body portion when present, the secondary winding being adapted to receive magnetic flux extending from a planar charging surface when present, and a layer of magnetic material situ- ated such that when the cap is removably fitted over the body portion, the layer of magnetic material is disposed between the secondary winding and the body portion of the electrical device for reducing current induced in the body of the elec- trical device. The cap is configured for placing in contact with the planar charging surface when present and to support the electrical device on the planar charging surface during charg- ing of the electrical device, and the secondary winding is arranged to be substantially parallel to the planar charging surface when present so that lines of magnetic flux extending from the planar charging surface pass substantially perpen- dicularly through the secondary winding during charging of\n\nFIG. 2 shows a variation of the example of FIG. 1, but where the secondary winding 12 comprises at least one coil, and preferably multiple, that is provided in a cap 6 that may be used to cover and protect the head portion 13 of the flashlight. Insucha case, the secondary winding 12 may be connected to the rechargeable battery using a charging cable (not shown), which may be fixed if the cap 6 is designed to be permanently attached to the flashlight 1, or may plug into the flashlight body 14 to connect to a charging circuit ifthe cap is designed. to be removed completely from the flashlight.\n\n45\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:\n\nThe embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2 are particularly suitable if the body of the flashlight is made of plastic or some other form of non-conductive material. However, if the flashlight body is made of metal or some other conductive material, then there may be problem in that the magnetic flux from the charging surface may induce currents in the body of the flashlight. Apart from being inefficient, this could cause the flashlight body to heat and either damage the flashlight or cause potential injury to anybody picking tip the flashlight.\n\nFIG. 1is aside view of one example of an electric flashlight according to one aspect of the invention placed upon a planar inductive charging platform,\n\nFIG. 2 is a side view of another example of a flashlight according to another aspect of the invention, and\n\nFIG. 3 shows detail for a variation of the example of\n\nFIG. 3 shows a variation of the example of FIG. 2 that is designed to mitigate the above-noted problem. In particular, in the example of FIG. 3, the cap 15 is provided with an interior layer 7 of magnetic material that when in use will be located between the cap 15 (formed with secondary winding 16) and the remainder of the flashlight body. This layer of magnetic material serves to shield the main body of the flash- light from the magnetic flux and thus increases the charging efficiency and reduces the potential heating of the flashlight body.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nReferring to FIG. 1 there is shown an electric device such as a flashlight 1 that is placed on a planar charging surface 10 of a charging platform 2.
