Wearable devices require portable power sources such as example batteries. Portable power sources often can suffer from power output capacity for a small footprint. A small portable power source often has a limited output capacity, while large portable power sources have a large enough power output but can be very heavy and are less suitable for wearable devices. Portable power sources can often be fragile and are limited by their size.\n\n[0014] In one configuration flexible substrate is bendable comprises a flexural modulus value such that the flexible substrate can bend or be wrapped around about a limb of human body while maintaining structural integrity.\n\n[0015] In one configuration the flexible substrate com- prises Polyimide or Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Poly- carbonate, Polypropylene, Polyethylene, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC).\n\n[0016] In one configuration the first electrode and the second electrode being coupled to either of the semiconduc- tor elements or the conductor member.\n\n[0003] Additionally common power sources for wearable devices are batteries e.g. Lithium ion batteries or other rechargeable batteries. Accidents related to batteries and battery systems can occur reasonably frequently. For example, Lithium ion batteries are easily prone to explo- sions at high temperatures or due to physical damage. Several current portable power sources also require constant recharging. There is a need for an improved power source.\n\n[0017] In one configuration the n type semiconductor ement the p type semiconductor element generating a flow electric current in response to heat or temperature gradi- applied to the device and the electric current flowing through the conductor member.\n\n[0018] In one configuration the p type semiconductor element comprises Tin Telluride (SnTe) or Bismuth Anti- mony Telluride (Bi, ;Sb, ;Te;) , and the n type semicon- ductor element comprises Lead Telluride (PbTe) or Bismuth Telluride(Bi,Te;).\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0004] The present disclosure relates to a thermoelectric device that converts applied heat ie. thermal energy to electricity. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a wearable thermoelectric device that can be worn by a user and generates electricity when exposed to body heat ie. a temperature difference caused by body heat. The thermo- electric device described herein induces a voltage and a current flow when exposed to a heat source.\n\n[0019] In one configuration the n type semiconductor element and the p type semiconductor element are elongate legs, each leg comprises a longitudinal axis that is longer than a transverse axis of the leg.\n\n[0020] In one configuration the n type semiconductor leg and the p type semiconductor leg being arranged adjacent and parallel to each other.\n\n[0005] The present disclosure further relates to a thermo- electric device that can be used as a wearable power source to power wearable electronic devices. The thermoelectric device as described herein can be worn such that the thermoelectric device coverts body heat to electricity, which allows the device to function as a wearable power source. The thermoelectric device disclosed herein can also function as a touch sensor to sense a touch from a person.\n\n[0021] In one configuration conductor member comprises metal that defines a current path for the current generated. semiconductor elements due to an applied heat or applied temperature gradient.\n\n[0022] In one configuration the flexible substrate com- prises a flexible sheet comprising a flexural modulus value such that the flexible substrate can bend about a limb of human body while maintaining structural integrity.\n\n[0006] According to a first aspect the present disclosure relates to a thermoelectric device for generating electricity, thermoelectric device comprising:\n\n[0023] In one configuration the conductor member aluminium or copper.\n\n[0007] a

The in-plane arrangement of the thermoelectric modules (i.e. the semiconductor elements) helps to increase the exposure area of the thermoelectric modules i.e. the area of the thermoelectric modules that are exposed to body heat. An increased area of exposure results in a larger current or voltage being produced by the ther- moelectric device 100, 200.\n\n[0156] The device 200 comprises three rows of thermo- electric modules 210A, 210B, 210C. The thermoelectric modules 210 within each row are connected in a series electrical connection i.e. a series arrangement. Each row may be in electrical communication with the adjacent rows. In one example form, the rows 210A, 210B, 210C may be interconnected to each other in a series electrical connection.

The encapsulation layer may be disposed over the thermoelectric modules (i.e. over the semiconductor ele- ments and conductor members). The encapsulation layer may encapsulate the device 100 or device 200. In one example the encapsulation layer may comprise a thin layer of polyimide that surrounds the substrate, the thermoelectric modules, electrodes and bridging members. The encapsula- tion layer provides protection to the devices 100 and 200 from environmental damage.\n\n[0162] The thermoelectric device 100, 200 is also advan- tageous because the thermoelectric generator 100, 200 power output capacity is not limited. The device 100, 200 is advantageous because the devices continuously harvests waste heat. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 as described provides a flexible, potable and wearable device that gen- erates electrical current and electrical power.

A finger touch is detected by the touch sensor 700 by detecting and measuring a change in voltage and current induced by the heat from the person\u2019s finger. The heat transfer between the finger and the sensor surface creates a temperature gradient on the material interface that leads to the generation of an impulse current i.e. a current pulse. A unique current pulse is generated each time the sensor 700 is touched by a user\u2019s finger.\n\npositioned at an opposing end of the substrate 702 to where the second electrode is located.\n\n[0174] The flexible substrate 702 is a flexible sheet of polyimide. As shown in the illustrated configuration of FIG. 7, the device 700 comprises a first flexible substrate 702 and a second flexible substrate 703. The first substrate 702 supports the p type semiconductor element 712. The second substrate 703 supports the n type semiconductor element 714. The first and second flexible substrates may be identical to each other in material, size and shape. Each flexible substrate 702, 703 is a rectangular sheet of polyimide material.

Each substrate may be flexible such that it can be bent or wrapped around a pipe.\n\n[0179] FIG. 8A shows a plot 800 of electrical pulses detected in response to a series of touches detected on the thermoelectric device i.e. touch sensor 700. The plot may be generated on a scope during testing of the touch sensor 700. FIG. 8A illustrates a plurality of pulses 810 which corre- spond to multiple detected touches. As seen in FIG. 8A each pulse represents a unique detected touch. Each pulse is a current pulse that is detected by the sensor i.e. each pulse is generated representing a detected touch. A unique touch represents the sensor 700 being touched and the finger being removed. Each current pulse is generated due to the body heat from the finger and due to a temperature difference created across the sensor by the finger touch. When the finger is removed the current drops to zero. FIG. 8A shows detected finger touches over 60 seconds. The rise and fall time of each electrical pulse is 150 ms and 200 ms respec- tively.\n\n[0175] The p type semiconductor element 712 is a planar member disposed on the first substrate 702. In the illustrated form p type semiconductor element 712 is attached to an inner surface of the first substrate 702. The p type semicon- ductor element 712 is in the form of a flexible planar film or a flexible planar sheet disposed on the substrate 702. The n type semiconductor element 714 is a planar member dis- posed on the second substrate 703. In the illustrated form the n type semiconductor element 714 is attached on an inner surface of the second substrate 703. The n type semicon- ductor element 714 is in the form of a flexible planar film or a flexible planar sheet disposed on the second substrate 703.\n\n[0180] FIG. 8B shows a plot of a single electrical pulse 810 i.e. a current pulse from the plot 800 of FIG. 8A. The current signal has a 0 current or low current region 812 which represents a non-contact time. When a finger contact is detected a voltage is induced and current flows through the thermoelectric modules. The pulse comprises a heating cycle 814 i.e. a period of rise time of the current signal. The time the pulse remains high indicates the contact time 816 between the sensor and the finger. Once the finger is lifted off the sensor 700 i.e. no contact or no heat the current is dissipated through a dissipation cycle 818.\n\n[0176] In the illustrated configuration the p type semicon- ductor element comprises Tin Telluride (SnTe). Alterna- tively, the p type semiconductor element comprises Bismuth Antimony Telluride (Bi, :Sb ;Te;). In the illustrated con- figuration the n type semiconductor element comprises Lead Telluride (PbTe). Alternatively, the n type semiconductor element comprises Bismuth Telluride(Bi,Te;). The first electrode 704 and the second electrode 706 comprise copper or aluminium contacts. The electrodes 704, 706 are prefer- ably thin film electrodes. The substrates, semiconductor elements and the electrodes are preferably formed of a thin film in order to create a device having a small footprint.\n\n[0181] The thermoelectric module 710 comprises a large seebeck coeflicient. The p type semiconductor elements 712 and the n type semiconductor elements 714 comprise low thermal conductivity. The large seebeck constant and the Jow thermal conductivity results in a sharp rise and fall time of the current signal e.g. a rise time of 150ms and a fall time of 200ms. The sensor 700 functions as an efficient touch sensor having a high responsivity. FIG. 8C illustrates a graph of the sensor responsivity. In one example form the thermoelectric device 700 ie. a sensor 700 comprise a sensor responsivity of about 0.2870 WV W-'. The sensor can be constructed to have a desired sensor responsivity depend- ing on the thickness of the p type and n type semiconductor elements 712, 714. The sensing junction ie. the region of overlap between the p type semiconductor element and the n type semiconductor element can be as required.\n\n[0177] The thermoelectric device 700 comprises a sand- wich structure comprising a plurality of layers. The layers comprise the first substrate 702, p type semiconductor element 712, n type semiconductor element 714 and the second substrate 704. The thermoelectric module 710 gen- erates electricity when exposed to heat or a temperature difference due to the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect results in charge movement in the p type and n type semiconductor elements 712, 714 and results in an induced voltage. The induced voltage causes current to flow. A portion of the p type semiconductor element 712 is attached to a portion of the n type semiconductor element 714. The p type semiconductor element overlaps a portion of the n type semiconductor element in a region where the p type semiconductor element contacts and is attached to the n type semiconductor element.\n\n[0182] The sensor 700 as described herein can be used for fast switching applications with high sensitivity. The sensor 700 construction provides a sensor that has faster switching and higher sensitivity as compared to resistive or capacitive sensors. For example, the sensor 700 can be used for touch heat mapping or imaging applications. Alternatively, the sensor could be used as a touch sensor in other suitable applications.
