Power adaptors (or AC-DC pow- er converters) are traditionally used to charge the batter- ies in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic products, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable elec- tronic equipment.\n\nPRIOR ART\n\n[0003] Recently, a number of types of planar inductive charging platforms have been proposed. One example is described in GB2399225A which generates an AC electromagnetic flux 1 with the flux lines flowing \"hori- zontally\" along the charging surface 2 as shown in Fig.1A. A distributed winding is used in this charging platform for generating the AC flux. This principle is in fact similar to the AC electromagnetic flux generated in a cylindrical motor, except that the cylindrical structure is compressed into a flat pancake shape. As the flux needs to flow hor- izontally along the upper and lower surfaces, two inherent limitations arise. [0004] Firstly, an electromagnetic flux guide must be used to guide the flux along the bottom surface. This is usually a layer of soft magnetic material such as ferrite or amorphous alloy. In order to provide sufficient flux, this layer must be \"thick\" enough so that the flux can flow along the layer of soft magnetic material without magnetic saturation. Secondly, a similar problem applies to the secondary device that has to pick up to flux (and energy) on the upper surface of the charging platform. [0005] Fig.1B shows the device required for the charg- ing platform of Fig.1A. This consists of a magnetic core 3 and a winding. In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area (shaded in Fig.1B). Therefore, this cross-sectional area must be large enough so that enough flux and energy can be picked up by the secondary device. It should be noted that this secondary device must be housed inside the electronic equipment to be charged on the charging platform. The thickness of the secondary device is crucial to the applicability and practicality of the device. If it is too thick, it simply cannot be housed in the electronic equipment. [0006] Another type of planar inductive battery charg-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n55\n\ning platform is described in GB2389720A. Unlike in GB2399225A, GB2389720A uses a multi-layer planar winding array to generate an AC flux 4 that has almost uniform magnitude over the entire charging surface 5. The lines of flux of this charging platform flow \"perpendicularly\" in and out of the charging surface as shown in Fig.2. This perpen- dicular flow of flux is very beneficial because it allows energy transfer over the surface on which the electronic equipment (to be charged) is placed. [0007] For both planar charging platforms described above, it is necessary to use an electromagnetic shield 6 on the bottom surface. If the charging platform is placed on a metallic desk, the AC flux generated in the charging platform may induce currents in the metallic desk, result- ing in incorrect energy transfer and even heating effects in the metallic desk. US patent 6,501,364 has been shown to be an effective electromagnetic shield for this type of planar charging platform. The electromagnetic shield in US6,501,364 simply consists of a thin layer of soft magnetic material (such as ferrite) and a thin layer of conductive material (such as copper). [0008] Regarding energy transfer from the planar sur- face, one coreless printed-circuit-board (PCB) transform- er technology pioneered by Hui and Tang [EP935263A; Chung, H., \u2019Coreless printed-circuit board transformers for signal and energy transfer\u2019, Electronics Letters, Vol- ume: 34 Issue: 11, 28 May 1998, Page(s): 1052 -1054; Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung; Tang, S.C., \u2019Core- less printed circuit board (PCB) transformers for power MOSFET/IGBT gate drive circuits\u2019, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Volume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 422 -430; Tang, S.C.; Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu- Hung Chung, \u2019Coreless printed circuit board (PCB) trans- formers with multiple secondary windings for comple- mentary gate drive circuits\u2019, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Volume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 431-437; Hui, S.Y.R.; Tang, S.C.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung, \u2019Optimal operation of coreless PCB transformer- isolated gate drive circuits with wide switching frequency range\u2019, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Vol- ume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 506 -514; Tang, S.C.; Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung, \u2019Coreless pla- nar printed-circuit-board (PCB) transformers-a funda- mental concept for signal and energy transfer\u2019, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Volume: 15 Issue: 5, Sept. 2000, Page(s): 931 -941] has been proven to be an effective way. [0009] Based on two planar windings on two parallel planes as shown in Fig.3, it has been shown that both energy and signal can be transferred from one planar winding to another. This planar PCB transformer tech- nology has been applied in a range of applications. In 2004, it was used by for a contactless battery charger for mobile phone in Choi B., Nho J., Cha H. and Choi S.:, \u2019Design and implementation of low-profile contactless battery charger using planar printed circuit board wind- ings as energy transfer device\u2019, IEEE Transactions on\n\n2\n\n3\n\nEP 1 915 809 B1\n\n4\n\nIndustrial Electronics, vol. 51, No.1, Feb. 2004, pp.140-147. Choi et al uses one planar winding as a pri- mary charging pad and a separate planar winding as a secondary winding as shown in Figs. 4A and 4B. Fig.5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit diagram of this con- tactless charging system. As explained in Choi et al, the circuit operation of the coreless PCB transformer is based on the theory proposed by Hui et al. It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described in Hui et al, while the front power stage of the secondary circuit is a standard winding with a diode rectifier that provides the rectified DC voltage for the charging circuit. [0010] Two main problems suffered by the charging system of Fig.5 proposed by Choi et al include: (1) The planar winding of the secondary module must be placed directly on top of the planar winding of the primary unit. If it is slightly misplaced, the energy transfer will be seri- ously hampered. (2) The use of one spiral planar winding in the secondary module to pick up energy emitted from the primary winding requires the choice of switching fre- quency to be very high. In Choi et al, the operating fre- quency has to be 950 kHz. Such high switching frequency leads to high switching loss in the primary inverter circuit, high AC resistance in the PCB copper tracks and more importantly high electromagnetic interference (EMI) emission. [0011] Problem (1) can be solved by using a planar inductive charging platform based on a multi-layer planar winding array structure, which allows the charged elec- tronic equipment to be placed anywhere on the charging surface as described in GB2389720A. However requiring a multi-layer charging platform increases the complexity of the charging platform undesirably. [0012] A planar inductive battery charging platform that generates magnetic field with lines of flux flowing per- pendicular to the planar surface (Fig.2) can be construct- ed in two ways. The first and simplest way is to excite a coil with an AC power source as shown in Fig.6A. A sec- ond method is to use a multi-layer winding matrix struc- ture as shown in Fig.6B similar to that described in GB2389720A. However, in both cases, it has been point- ed out (Liu, X.; Chan, P.W.; Hui, S.Y.R.;, \"Finite element simulation of a universal contactless battery charging platform\", IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference 2005. APEC 2005. Volume 3, 6-10 March 2005 Page(s):1927-1932) that a central voltage sag phenom- enon exists. In practice, a secondary module (or energy receiving element) is used to pick up the energy for charg- ing the load. Fig.7 shows that in one practical experimen- tal setup, the rectified DC voltage picked up by a sec- ondary module on the planar surface is not entirely uni- form over the planar surface and in particular is reduced in the central part of the planar surface. This is known as central voltage sag phenomenon. This voltage sag in- creases as the surface area of the charging surface in- creases.

[0015] Preferably the second winding is located con- centrically with respect to said first winding. [0016] The first and second windings may be planar windings preferably located in the same plane, or may be planar windings located in parallel planes. [0017] The first and second windings may be formed as conductive coils, or may be formed as conductive tracks on one or more printed circuit boards. [0018] The first and second windings may be connect- ed together in series or in parallel, and may be driven in the same phase and the same polarity or may be driven independently. [0019] The first winding may preferably extend about the periphery of the charging surface and the second winding may be located at the center of said charging surface. Preferably the second winding is a spiral wind- ing. The first winding and the second winding may be generally rectangular or circular. [0020] In cases where a single second winding is in- sufficient to compensate for voltage sag, a third winding is provide located within said area defined by said first winding.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0021] Some embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-\n\nFigs.1A and 1B show respectively a prior art induc- tive battery charging platform and a corresponding secondary energy receiving element for use there- with, Fig.2 shows another form of prior art inductive bat- tery charging platform, Fig.3 shows typical prior art planar windings as may be applied for example to opposite sides of a printed circuit board,\n\n3\n\n5\n\nEP 1 915 809 B1\n\n6\n\nFigs.4A and 4B show respectively planar windings on two parallel planes and their use in a prior art battery charging platform, Fig.5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit of the system of Fig.4B, Figs.6A and 6B show respectively a single coil for generating a magnetic field with lines of flux flowing vertically into and out of the plane of the coil and a multi-layer structure for generating perpendicular lines of flux, Fig.7 shows the voltage induced in a secondary mod- ule placed on the surface of a prior art planar induc- tive charging platform, Figs.8A and 8B show respectively (a) a schematic of a planar charging platform and (b) a schematic of a planar charging platform according to an embodi- ment of the present invention Fig.9 illustrates the induced voltages due to the mag- netic flux generated by the principal and auxiliary coils of the embodiment of Fig.8B, and Fig.10 illustrates the measured voltage picked up by an energy receiving element from the planar charg- ing platform of the embodiment of Fig.8(b).\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBOD- IMENTS\n\n[0022] In order to compensate for the voltage sag phe- nomenon in the central area of the planar inductive bat- tery charging platform, according to embodiments of the present invention a second auxiliary winding can be placed in the central region of the charging surface in order to boost the electromagnetic flux in that region to compensate for the voltage sag phenomenon. [0023] Fig.8A shows a schematic of a planar inductive charging platform based on a single planar primary wind- ing 7 that surrounds a charging surface. In this context the term \"primary\" is used in the same sense as a trans- former, and the energy receiving element will comprises the \"secondary\". Fig.8B shows a schematic of planar in- ductive charging platform with a second auxiliary winding according to an embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen from Fig.8B, this embodiment of the present invention includes a first primary planar winding 7 that as in Fig.8A surrounds the charging surface, but further includes a second spiral primary planar winding 8 that is located within an area defined by the first and principal primary winding. Preferably the second auxiliary winding is located generally concentrically with the principal wind- ing so that the center of the spiral of the auxiliary winding is located in the center of the principal primary winding where the voltage sag is at its most extreme. [0024] Fig.9 shows the corresponding induced voltag- es that would be picked up by the secondary module due to the two excited windings (the principal primary winding and the auxiliary winding). The additional voltage (Curve Y) due to the magnetic flux generated by the auxiliary winding in the central region compensates for the central\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nvoltage sag phenomenon in the planar charging platform. Fig.10 shows a practical example of a charging platform with such an auxiliary winding excited in the same way as the first primary coil. It can be seen that the voltage sag is greatly reduced. This experimental result confirms the improvement of the charging ability of the charging platform due to the auxiliary winding. [0025] It will be understood that the flux generated by the first primary winding is greater than the flux generated by the auxiliary second winding. The purpose of the sec- ond winding is to compensate for the voltage sag phe- nomenon and therefore the second winding is driven such that it generates sufficient flux to provide this com- pensation without going too far and resulting in a voltage peak where the second winding is located. [0026] It will be understood that a number of variations on the embodiment illustrated in Fig.8B are possible. For example the principal and auxiliary primary windings may be formed either as conductive coils or may be formed as conductive tracks on a printed circuit board (PCB). The principal and auxiliary windings may preferably be formed in the same plane (for example if they are formed on the same PCB), or may be formed in parallel but slight- ly spaced apart planes. In addition, while the windings are shown in Figs.8A and 8B in a rectangular form this is not essential and the windings may take other shapes such as circular windings. [0027] The auxiliary winding should be located at or close to the part of the charging surface where the voltage sag occurs. Generally this may be in the center of the platform, but depending on the design of the principal winding if the sag occurs elsewhere then the auxiliary winding should be located correspondingly. Generally one auxiliary winding may be sufficient to compensate for the voltage sag but if not, for example if the charging surface is particularly large, then two or more auxiliary windings may be employed. [0028] The principal and the auxiliary winding may be connected together in parallel or in series and may be driven in phase and the same polarity. Alternatively the auxiliary winding may be driven separately from the prin- cipal winding such that the flux generated by the auxiliary winding can be controlled so as to be sufficient to com- pensate for the voltage sag without generating any un- desirable flux peak as it is desirable that the flux gener- ated over the surface of the charging platform should be as uniform as possible. It will be understood that in preferred embodi- [0029] ments the present invention is particularly suitable for use with planar windings where the lateral dimensions (eg width and length of a rectangular winding or circum- ference of a circular winding) are substantially greater than the thickness or height of the winding whether it is a very thin winding such as a conductive track on a PCB, or a slightly thicker winding formed by a wire coil. Such windings may be considered in a general sense to lie in a plane even though they will nevertheless have a defined thickness even if it is small. However the invention may\n\n4\n\n7\n\nEP 1 915 809 B1\n\n8\n\nalso be applied to embodiments where the thickness or height of the winding becomes more significant and the term planar may not apply so readily.\n\nin said first winding (7) extends about the periphery of the charging surface and wherein said second winding (8) is located at the center of said charging surface.\n\n5\n\nClaims\n\n12.
