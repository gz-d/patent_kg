An in vivo zebrafish assay would eliminate those lead compounds, due to the toxic effects, from the list identified from the in vitro assays before entering a more expensive phase of in vivo validation. An in vivo zebrafish assay has been demonstrated as a useful method for screening angio- genic drugs (reviewed by (Kidd and Weinstein, 2003)). For example, Serbedzija and his coworkers described a screening methodology which was based on the counting number of subintestinal blood vessels formed on the surface of the yolk on both side of the embryo (Serbedzija et al., 1999). Blood vessels were stained for endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Transgenic zebrafish lines with fluorescent blood vessels have been developed (Cross et al., 2003; Lawson and Weinstein, 2002) such that the imaging and analysis of angio- genesis can be greatly simplified. However, there is still no methodology describing fully the procedures and tools how zebrafish may be used as a quantitative tool for angiogenic\n\nThis application is a 371 of PCT/CN2007/000034 application filed on Jan. 8, 2007.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nnew blood vessels from existing blood vessels (Risau, 1997). This process normally occurs in growth and development, and wound healing by restoring blood flow to tissues. How- ever, loss of control in angiogenesis is a common factor in most important diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (Liekens et al., 2001). These diseases may result from or progress when new blood vessels either grow exces- sively or insufficiently. Excessive angiogenesis occurs, for example, in cancer by abnormal production of excessive amounts of angiogenic growth factors in order to form new blood vessels for excessive demand of nutrient. On the other hands, insufficient angiogenesis occurs, for example, in coro- nary artery disease, causing tissue damage and death due to inadequate production of angiogenic growth factor for suffi- cient growth of blood vessels. Therefore, therapies aimed at treating the loss of the control in angiogenesis are actively\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nteleost embryos as a model to screen agents with angiogen- esis modulating activities and with no apparent toxicity. The present 3-tier screening system fulfills the criteria for an ideal quantitative angiogenesis assay listed above and provides an effective screening assay system to identify angiogenic modulating agent with least toxicity. The screening system consists of 3 hierarchical tiers: 1) lead identification; 2) gen- eral toxicity test; 3) organ-specific toxicity test. The preferred model of the present invention is zebrafish or medaka embryos. The advantage of the present invention is that it can rapidly identify potential angiogenic modulating agents at the first tier and these potential angiogenic modulating agents then subject to the tier 2 and 3 safety tests respectively. There- fore, the final candidates of the lead agents which pass all the 3 tiers will have the desirable angiogenic activity with the\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nesis-related therapeutics, it is difficult to find a suitable assay to assess the effect of angiogenesis response (Staton et al., 2004). The most widely used assays are in vitro assays in which new drugs are tested in endothelial cells cultured in plastic flasks. The drawback is that it is difficult to extrapolate the observation made in an in vitro assay to model the com- plex process of angiogenesis actually occurring in in vivo situations (Staton et al., 2004; Taraboletti and Giavazzi, 2004). On the other hand, in vivo assays using animal models, for example mice, are costly, time-consuming and difficult for quantification (Staton et al., 2004). Thus, multiple in vitro assays are commonly employed for the identification of lead. compounds. The efficacy of lead compounds on angiogenesis are subsequently validated by more than one in vivo assay. However, quantification is still an important key parameter for angiogenesis assays. Criteria for an ideal quantitative angiogenesis assay (Hasan et al., 2004) are that the assay\n\ncapable of inducing alteration in the vasculature pattern in teleosts. In this tier, embryos are treated by agents in wide range of concentration, covering 7 orders of magnitude. To visualize blood vessels in transparent embryos, color staining is applied to detect endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity predominantly in vascular endothelial cells. The pattern of intersegmental vessels is chosen as the target to be examined because the pattern is regular and the variation between indi- vidual is very little, making the interpretation of angiogenic effect much easier. The preferred stage of embryos to be examined is at least 72 hour-post fertilization (hpf).

The dose response relationship describes the change in the effects, i.e. death and malformation, caused by differing levels of concentrations of the agent. Studying dose response relationship is central to determine safe and hazardous levels for the agent under study. Dose response relationship is plotted as a graph, called dose response curve. The first point along the curve where a response, i.e. total effects inclusive death and malformation, above zero is reached is referred as the threshold concentration, or no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC).

It appears that an in vivo drug screening assay using zebrafish as model fulfill the criteria of an ideal quan- titative angiogenesis assay. An in vivo zebrafish assay has the advantages and convenience of in vitro assays (high through- put comparing to in vitro assays) and in vivo assays (being an intact organism), and thus is capable to serve as bridge or filter between in vitro screening and subsequent in vivo validation\n\nsaid\n\nPCT\n\nAngiogenesis is a physiological process of formation of\n\npursued by pharmaceutical companies all over the world.\n\nEven though there is a huge potential market for angiogen-\n\nshould:\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n(Epstein and Epstein, 2005; Goldsmith, 2004; Parng et al.,\n\ndrug discovery together with the corresponding toxicity test.\n\nThis invention relates to a 3-tier screening system using\n\nleast toxicity.

Therefore, safety of an agent will be evaluated by mean of a cytotoxicity test, organ toxicity test and cardiotoxicity test. In addition, angiogenic modulating activity will be tested at NOAEC. In this tier, visualization of intersegmental vessels is by microangiography imaging technology in which fluores- cent dye, e.g. fluorescent microbead or fluorescent dextrans, are injected into the blood circulation such that it will be diffused to all registered blood vessels by blood circulation. Alteration of intersegmental vessels will be an indicator for angiogenic modulating activity. Agent with any positive results in one of the test or negative results in angiogenic modulating activity will be discarded. Otherwise, it will be considered as safe with angiogenic modulating activity.\n\nThe aim of the third tier is to find out any side effect of the agent at the concentration level not causing any gross adverse effects, such as death and malformation in teleost. Therefore, tests included in the third tier are cellular toxicity test, organ- specific toxicity test and cardiotoxicity test. In the cytotoxic- ity test, number of dead cells (apoptotic cells) is quantified by low cytometry. By flow cytometry, one can analyze, in addi- tion to amount of dead cells, the amount of cells in different stages of cell cycle in a large number of samples, like 300 teleosts in a single experiment. In organ-specific toxicity, morphology of an organ is studied by fluorescent in situ hybridization with an organ specific probe. The morphology of the organ is quantified by 3D reconstruction of the optical sections from confocal images. Any change in the size and shape of the organ may reveal the toxic effects induced by the agent tested. Cardiotoxicity tests whether the positive candi- date is able to affect cardiac functions, such as cardiac output and cardiac rhythm. Cardiotoxicity is an important test because more and more drugs have been shown to exhibit side effects on the heart, even in rare occurrence, and needed to be withdrawn from market. Finally, the effect of angiogenic modulating activity of the positive candidate is evaluated at the NOAEC. The positive candidate that does not induce any cytotoxic, organ-specific toxic and cardiotoxic effects and exhibits angiogenic modulating activity at the NOAEC is said\n\nDETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention provides methods for screening agents for angiogenic modulating activity.\n\nA variety of agents, either synthetic or from natural sources, can be screened using the present invention. Agents can be small molecules in pure form or a crude extract of an herb or crude extracts of a combination of different herbs. Agents should be administrated in soluble form, with a vari- ety of carrier solvents, e.g. ethanol, DMSO. The maximum concentrations of these solvents at which no malformation is induced in zebrafish are reported (Hallare et al., 2006). For example, the level of DMSO and ethanol used in zebrafish embryo assay should be below 1.5% and 1% respectively. The agent should first be dissolved in the carrier solvent, if nec- essary. Then it is added to the embryo media containing 20 fertilized eggs or healthy embryos at desired concentration. The preferred starting time of addition is prior the onset of angiogenesis, i.e. 24 hpf. Any effect induced by the presence of administered agent will be observed after certain interval period of time, e.g., 24 hours or 48 hours or more. Egg collection, picking up fertilized eggs, and identification of healthy embryos are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (Westerfield,\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n1. Material and Methods\n\na. Egg Collection\n\nZebrafish mate and spawn with the light on. In order to collect eggs, it is necessary to protect the eggs from being eaten by the adults. The egg collection box used is made of acrylic with a metal mesh mounted on top. This is then cov- ered with plastic seaweed so that the adults will mate where the plastic seaweed is, and the eggs that are spawned will fall into the acrylic box. The eggs are to be protected from adult fish consumption with a metal mash. The collection box should be removed after 30 min duration of the light period. The eggs are then to be collected by pouring fish water from the collection box through a fish net. The eggs should be rinsed under running tap water for 30 seconds, then trans- ferred into a 90-mm Petri dish with 15 ml of embryo medium (19.3 mM NaCl, 0.23 mM KCl, 0.13 mM MgSO,-7H,0, 0.2 mM Ca(NO3)>, 1.67 mM Hepes (pH 7.2)). The dish should then be kept in an incubator at 28\u00b0 C.\n\nIn the first tier, fertilized egg at 4 hpf are bathed in embryo medium containing various concentrations of agent to be tested with 10-fold increment in concentration. The total number of concentrations to be tested is seven. Therefore, the range of concentrations to be tested covers 7 orders of mag- nitude. After incubation for a certain time period (e.g. 96 hours), embryos are fixed and blood vessels are visualized by color staining which specifically stains endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity predominantly in vascular endothelial cells. The number of intersegmental vessels is counted in each individual embryo. The number of embryos exhibiting a decrease or increase in the number of intersegmental vessels is counted at each concentration. An agent at any concentra- tion inducing alteration of the number of intersegmental ves- sels will be stated as a potential lead and passed to tier 2. Simultaneously, numbers of dead embryos are also counted at each concentration. This data will serve as preliminary range of concentrations to be tested in the following second tier.\n\nb. Administration of Agents\n\nAgents are dissolved in a desired concentration such that the highest testing concentration contains a concentration of arrier solvent (e.g. DMSO, ethanol) not more than the rec- mmended tolerant concentration. Agents are to be added directly to the medium solution at 4 hpf of the fish embryos. Assays should be performed in Petri dishes (60 mmx15 mm, Falcon, BD Bioscience, San Jose, Calif.). Each Petri dish is to hold 20 embryos.\n\nIn the second tier, occurrence of death and malformation is counted upon exposure of teleost to different concentrations of the potential lead agent identified in tier 1. The concentra- tion range to be tested is preliminarily determined in the range-finding experiment in the first tier.

For a dose response study in tier 2, the range of concentrations to be tested covers from the lowest at which no adverse effect is observed to the highest concentration at which all embryos are killed.\n\nAfter staining for 12 minutes, all the blood vessels in the fish embryo are labeled. The staining reaction is stopped by wash- ing three times in PBT and embryos are fixed in 4% paraform- aldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes. The embryos are then washed briefly in PBT twice and 10 minutes 4 times. After washing, embryos should be immersed in 70% glycerol in PBS before examination and image capturing on a CCD camera.\n\nFor cytotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and organ toxicity in tier 2 and the mechanistic study in tier 3, the only concentration to be tested is the NOAEC determined from the dose response curve. For each concentration of the agent, 6 ml of culture medium is to be added to twenty embryos cultured in a Petri dish. Fifteen replications per agent per concentration (i.e. 20x15=300 embryos for each concentration of an agent) are then tested. The effect could be observed at different time points, e.g. 28 hpf, 52 hpf or 76 hpf. Furthermore, the further experiments to examine toxicity and angiogenesis can be performed following agent treatment.\n\nTo examine pro-/anti-angiogenic activity induced by a compound, the number of intersegmental vessels is required to be counted under a stereomicroscope or a compound. microscope. Stained embryos are positioned laterally in glyc- erol. The region of examination is from the first intersegmen- tal vessels to the one just above the anus. In general, there should be 12-13 pairs. The advantage is that there is a constant number of intersegmental vessels in 3-day embryos which makes the comparison between the control and treatment groups easier. Another advantage of using the zebrafish for this type of assay is that the subintestinal vessels, which are located over the yolk, are both sensitive to factors which affect vessel formation and are easily assayed by this method. The subintestinal vessels are normally present on the dorso- lateral surface of the yolk of zebrafish embryos by 48 hours of development. They form a distinct basket shape that extends 50-100 hm from the ventral edge of the somite over the yolk. By assaying the subintestinal vessels at 72 hours of develop- ment (24 hours after the subintestinal vessels normally appear), the normal variation in the timing of the vessel for- mation is avoided.\n\nc. Toxicity Test\n\nTo determine the toxicity of a compound for a biological system, an observable and well-defined endpoint must be identified. Mortality is one of these widely used endpoints. The index of lethal effects describing the potency of a com- pound is called LC; , which is defined as the dosage of a chemical causing death in at least 50% of the animals tested. In addition to lethality, adverse effects such as malformation in morphology induced by a compound can be used as an observable endpoint. These adverse outcomes along with death are grouped as total adverse effects. The potency of a compound to induce adverse effects is defined as EC, which is the concentration ofa compound causing at least 50% of the animals tested to exhibit abnormal appearances as well as death.\n\ne. Microangiography\n\nstein et al. (Nat Genet, 1995), with modifications. Embryos are to be mounted laterally in 0.3% agarose as described low. Fluoresceinated and carboxylated latex microbeads (0.02-um, cat# F-8787, Molecular Probes, USA) are then injected into the sinus venosus. The bead suspension should be diluted 1:1 with 2% BSA, sonicated at maximum power for 5 minutes, then centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 minutes. The supernatant is then to be transferred to a new tube for injection. Glass microneedles are then prepared from 1 mm OD capillaries (World Precision Instruments, cat # TW100-4 or TW100E-4 for glass without or with an internal filament) by using a Narishige PC-10 micropipette puller. To make these microneedles, this micropipette puller is required to pull the glass capillary vertically using the gravitational force of its own weight. A double pull is set in which the first pull is at a temperature of 76\u00b0 C. and the second pull is at a temperature of 64\u00b0 C. Microneedles are then to be broken open by a Narishige MF-900 micro-forge to give an opening of approxi- mately 5 hm in width. The tip of microneedle needs to be broken by pushing against a small drop of glass melted on to the platinum wire of the micro-forge, monitored at 10x object of the micro-forge.

A glass microneedle is then inserted obliquely into the sinus venosus. Many (20+) small boluses of bead suspension should be injected over the course of up to a minute. Confocal images are acquired after letting the embryo recover for 3-5 minutes. The instrument setting is like the one described below.

Twenty- four and forty-eight hours after adding the compound to the medium in which the fish embryos are cultured, the embryos are then visually inspected for mortality, movements and gross morphological defects under a dissecting microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The number of dead embryos of the 20 embryos tested in each experiment is then to be scored. Data collected from the 15 replicates are to be tested for the hypothesis that no differences existed between mortality over all concentrations. Analyses of variance are then done, along with the post-hoc Tukey\u2019s honestly significant differ- ence test to determine the differences in mortality between treatment concentrations and the untreated control. Likewise, analyses of variance and the post-hoc Tukey honest signifi- cant difference test are both used to determine the differences in total adverse effects between treatment concentrations and the untreated control. The software Statistica for Windows (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla., USA) is to be used for the calcula- tions.\n\nd. Endogenous Alkaline Phosphatase Staining\n\nEmbryos older than 72 hpf can be used for endogenous alkaline phosphatase staining Specifically, embryos are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and 1% Triton x-100.

These agents were chosen from books of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Out of 1431 compounds, there were 11 showing anti-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentra- tions. The phenomenon of anti-angiogenesis was the absence of at least one intersegmental vessel. Out of 107 herbs, there were 11 showing anti-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentrations. Out of 13 formulas tested, there were 4 showing anti-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentrations while there were 3 showing pro-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentrations.

The NOAECs for each agent were then been determined. Among them, there were 6 agents (4 herbs and 2 formulas) that no NOAEC could be determined and thus they were not further tested in the third tier.\n\nTaraboletti, G. and Giavazzi, R. (2004).

Therefore, they were failed in the third tier and no further toxicity test was carried out. Five out of 7 herbs induced. ectopic apoptosis at their NOAECs while the remaining 2 passed the cytotoxicity test. Among these 2, only one exhib- ited antiangiogenic activity and passed organ-specific toxic- ity tests and cardiotoxicity at its NOAEC. Furthermore, 3 out of 5 formulas did not induce ectopic apoptosis at their NOAEC and proceeded to further tests while the remaining 2 failed in the cytotoxicity test. Among the 3 passing the cyto- toxicity test, one failed to induce any change in vasculature at its NOAEC. But there was 1 exhibited anti-angiogenic activ- ity at its NOAEC while there was 1 exhibited pro-angiogenic activity. These 2 formulas had passed the organ-specific tox- icity tests and cardiotoxicity test. Therefore, there were 3 agents, including 1 herb and 2 formulas, that passed all 3 tiers\n\nchical 3-tier biological screening assay system comprising: (i) in the first tier,\n\ntreating teleost embryos with a test agent at different concentrations covering seven orders of magnitude, while simultaneously, testing a control group\n\nobserving the vascular system of said embryos, wherein said embryos are at least 3-day old embryos, for alteration in the constant number of intersegmental sels at the different concentrations of the test agent;\n\nwherein any observed alteration in the constant number intersegmental vessels in the teleost embryo treated with agent will lead to a conclusion that the test agent is angiogenic modulating agent and the agent will proceed second tier for further testing;\n\n(ii) in the second tier,\n\n(a) plotting a dose response curve to show the dose response relationship of the test agent as compared to a control;\n\ndetermining the highest concentration at which are no statistically significant increases in the percentage of adverse effects on teleost embryos between the group exposed to the test agent and the control group, wherein said adverse effects include death or malformation of teleost embryos;\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCross, L.M., Cook, M.A., Lin, S., Chen, J.N. and Rubinstein, A.
