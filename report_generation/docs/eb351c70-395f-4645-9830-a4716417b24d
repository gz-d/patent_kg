The ground plane of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna may be provided by the conductor strip on the base surface.\n\n[0001] The invention relates to an antenna and a commu- nication device having one or more such antennas.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Recently, the demand for multi- (e.g., dual-) fre- quency antenna systems in radar and wireless communica- tion systems has increased. One example is the desire to have radio-on-fiber links to simultaneously carry microwave radio signals and high-speed millimeter-wave signals. Another impetus comes from the endeavor to design wide- band communication systems that comply with 4G, 5G, and future wireless standards that include millimeter-wave bands. Coverage of two or more widely-separated wave bands may thus be desirable.\n\n[0011] Preferably, the opposite side surfaces are generally parallel.\n\n[0012] Preferably, the opposite side surfaces are separated a first distance, and the first distance is at least half-wavelength distance.\n\n[0013] Optionally, the groove includes a first portion at the middle and second and third portions at two ends. At the first portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a first distance; at the second portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a second distance; at the third portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a third distance. The first distance is larger than the second distance and the third distance. Preferably, the first distance is at least a half- wavelength distance. Preferably, the second distance equals the third distance.\n\n[0003] Thus, there is a need for an antenna, in particular multi- (e.g., dual-) frequency antenna with a high-frequency ratio, to cover two or more widely-separated frequency/ wave bands.\n\n[0004] Some existing systems/methods provide such antennas by using two or more radiators, either vertically stacked or horizontally arranged, each operating at a differ- ent frequency band. These systems/methods may provide a high frequency ratio, but they are relatively heavy and bulky.\n\n[0014] Preferably, the antenna further includes a first exci- tation member for receiving an excitation signal to operate the antenna as the dielectric resonator antenna. The first excitation member may include a conductor strip arranged on an outer surface of the dielectric block. The conductor strip may be generally rectangular or generally trapezoidal, tapered, etc.\n\n[0005] U.S. Pat. No. 9,966,662B proposes a solution that improves on these existing systems/methods. It teaches a compact dual-frequency antenna based on a single radiator with two back-to-back folded plates. In this structure, the folded plates form a microwave parallel-plate waveguide resonator antenna and the separation between the folded plates gives a millimeter-wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. The waveguide resonator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna provide bandwidths of 9.7% and 2.1% and cover the 2.4 and 24 GHz ISM bands, respectively. Prob- lematically, however, much wider bandwidths would be required to simultaneously support two or more of 4G, 5G, and future standard communications. Also, the antenna disclosed is rather heavy as it uses relatively thick metals to keep the conductive plates parallel.\n\n[0015] Preferably, the antenna further includes a second excitation member for receiving an excitation signal to operate the antenna as the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. Preferably, the groove generally elongates in a first direc- tion, and the dielectric block further includes an opening continuous with the groove and generally extends in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. Prefer- ably, the opening is continuous with the groove in a central portion of the groove. Preferably, the second excitation member comprises a L-probe arranged at least partly in the opening. The antenna may further include an air-filled metallic cable arranged in the opening and generally coaxi- ally with a portion of the L-probe in the opening. The antenna may further include a suppressor for suppressing cross polar fields generally by the L-probe. The suppression may include an arc-shaped sleeve attached to the air-filled metallic cable. Optionally, the arc-shaped sleeve is semicir-\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0006] It is an object of the invention to address the above needs, to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages or, more generally, to provide an antenna, in particular a multi- (e.g., dual-) frequency antenna that is compact, light, and operationally-effective in supporting 4G, 5G, or any other future wireless communication standards.\n\n[0016] Preferably, the dielectric resonator antenna is microwave dielectric resonator antenna and the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna is a millimeter wave Fabry-Perot resona- antenna.\n\n[0007] In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an antenna, comprising a (single) dielectric block with a groove, and a conductor arranged in the groove; the antenna is arranged to be excited to operate as a dielectric resonator antenna and a Fabry-Perot resonator antenna.

The conductor strip 110 is arranged to receive an excitation signal (e.g., from a SMA connector 112 that extends through a through-hole 104A in the ground plane 104) to operate the antenna 100 as the dielectric resonator antenna. The conductor strip 110 may be a generally vertical inverted trapezoidal strip having a vertical height L., a base width W.5, and a top width Ws wider than the base width Ws. This trapezoidal configuration may improve imped- ance match of the dielectric resonator antenna. In another embodiment, the conductor strip 110 may be a generally rectangular strip (when W,,=W,,).\n\nTABLE I\n\nDimensions of the Dual-Frequency Antenna Parameter le Wo lyn W Ly d Ho Value 100 24 2 15 5 72 4 (mm) Parameter Hy He Hs Hy, Ly Ws We Value 20 10 28 05 28 2 2 (mm) Parameter ls Lp \u00ae% % 8 % & Value 105 28 49 19 127 49 10 (mm)\n\narranged in the groove 106 includes conductor strips arranged on the opposite side-surfaces and the base surface of the dielectric block 102. As best shown in FIG. 1B, the groove 106 includes a first portion at the middle and second and third portions at two ends. At the first portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a distance d; at the second and third portions, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a distance smaller than distance d. Theoreti- cally, the distance d between the conductor strips portions 108 at the first portion should be equal to a half wavelength (ie., a half-wavelength distance). However, in practice, when the finite thickness of the conductor strips portions 108 are considered, the distance d may be slightly larger than a half wavelength. The reduced distance between the conduc- tor strips portions 108 in the second and third portions enables the formation of four ridges 114 sized L,xW, for suppressing side lobes of the antenna 100 when the antenna\n\n[0046] Agilent network analyzers E5071C and E8361A were used to measure the S-parameters of dielectric reso- nator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2. Satimo StarLab system and Near- field System Incorporation (NSI) measurement system were used for measuring the radiation pattern, antenna gain, and antenna efficiency of the dielectric resonator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2.\n\n[0047] In this example, in the microwave band, the dielec- resonator antenna resonates in its TE, ,,* mode.\n\nnator antenna embedded in the dielectric resonator antenna. The conductor strip 108 on the base surface may provide the ground plane of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. As shown in FIGS. 1A to 1C, the dielectric block 102 further includes an generally cylindrical opening 116 arranged at and continuous with a central portion of the groove 106. The opening 116 has a diameter \u00ae, The opening extends below and generally perpendicular to the elongation direction of the groove 106. The ground plane 104 includes a corre- sponding through-hole 104B aligned with the opening 116. An L-probe 118 extending through the openings 116, 104B is used to receive an excitation signal (e.g., from a SMA connector 120) to operate the antenna 100 as the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. The L-probe 118 includes a vertical arm portion 118A with length L, and diameter Ta and a hori- zontal arm portion 118B with length L,, and height H, continuous with the vertical arm portion (FIGS. 1C and 1D). The horizontal arm portion extends generally parallel to the elongation direction of the groove 106 (FIG. 1B). As best shown in FIG. 1C, a 50Q air-filled metallic cable 122 is also arranged in the opening and generally coaxially with the vertical arm portion of the L-probe 118. The cable 122 has an outer diameter \u4e2d; and an inner diameter \u00ae,. A suppressor in the form of a half-ring sleeve 124 with height H, extends from an end of the coaxial cable 122 to introduce an opposite\n\n[0048] FIG. 3 tion coefficients of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2. A reasonable agreement between them can be observed. With reference to FIG. 3, the mea- sured and simulated 10-dB impedance bandwidths (S,, 10 dB) of the dielectric resonator antenna are 10.06% (2.36-2.61 GHz) and 7.32% (2.37-2.55 GHz) respectively. This covers the entire 2.4-GHz ISM band (2.40-2.48 GHz). A0.018 GHz (0.73%) frequency shift between the measured (2.451 GHz) and simulated (2.469 GHz) resonant frequen- cies of the dielectric resonator antenna is observed. This frequency shift may be caused by experimental tolerances including machining errors and possible air gaps between A\n\nnator antenna on the dielectric resonator antenna, a reference solid dielectric resonator antenna having the same dimen- sions as the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2 is considered. The reference dielectric resonator antenna is also excited in the TEL mode. It was found that the reference dielectric resonator antenna also resonates at 2.45 GHz when its dielectric constant E equals 10.6, which is slightly larger than that of the current dielectric resonator antenna (\u00a2,=10). This means that in practice the integration of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna does not increase the volume of the antenna. For ease of comparison, the simu- lated reflection coeflicients of the reference dielectric reso- nator antenna are also illustrated in FIG. 3. It can be seen that the simulated reflection coefficient of the reference dielectric resonator antenna almost overlaps that of the dielectric\n\n[0045] A dual-fed dual-frequency antenna that covers 2.4 GHz and 24 GHz ISM bands was designed using ANSYS HESS based on the antenna configuration of FIGS. 1A to 1C.

The measured and simulated boresight antenna gains (9=0) of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2 are 6.71 dBi at 2.57 GHz and 6.86 dBi at 2.49 GHz. As expected, the simulated antenna gains are slightly lower than those of the reference dielectric resonator antenna because the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2 has stronger cross-polar fields as a result of the generally rectangular groove. The results above show that the perfor- mance of the dielectric resonator antenna is substantially unaffected by the presence of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna.\n\n[0055] To investigate the influence of the wideband Fabry- Perot resonator antenna on the dielectric resonator antenna, a reference wideband solid dielectric resonator antenna excited in its TE,,,;* and TEL modes was also studied. For ease of comparison, the same dielectric resonator antenna dimensions and dielectric constant (\u00a2,=10.6) are used for the reference dielectric resonator antenna.\n\n[0051] The performance of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2 was also studied. FIG. 5 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 200 o FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 5 the measured and simulated resonant frequencies are 24.02 GHz and 24.10 GHz respec- tively, whereas the measured and simulated impedance bandwidths are 6.3% (23.36-24.88 GHz) and 5.1% (23.49- 24.72 GHz), respectively.

It can be seen from FIG. 7 that both the resonant TE,,,* and TEL modes of the dielectric resonator antenna o the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are excited. The measured and simulated impedance bandwidths of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are 38.24% (2.20-3.24 GHz) and 38.53% (2.20-3.25 GH Z) respectively, with good agreement between the measured and simulated bandwidths. The two resonant frequencies of the reference dielectric resonator antenna are almost the same as those of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna o FIG. 7. This means that the integration resonator antenna with the dielectric resonator antenna does not increase the volume of the dual-frequency antenna. the antenna 300 o of the Fabry-Perot\n\n[0052] FIG. 6 shows the measured and simulated bore- sight antenna gains of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna o the antenna 200 of FIG. 2. The measured and simulated results are in reasonable agreement. As shown FIG. 6, the measured and simulated boresight antenna gains (9=07) are 10.07 dBi at 23.8 GHz and 11.18 dBi at 24.0 GHz, respec- tively. The measured antenna gain is 1.11 dB lower than the simulated antenna gain. This may be caused by the conduc- tive loss of the conductive strips used in fabricating the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna prototype 200.\n\n[0057] FIGS. 9A and 9B show the measured and simulated radiation patterns of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 at 2.45 GHz as well as the simulated results of the reference wid leband dielectric resonator antenna. As can be observed 9B, the measured and simulated results of the wideband from FIGS. 9A and dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are in reasonable agreement. In the boresig all of the cross-polar fields are weaker presence of the groove, the H-plane cros: ht direction (6=0\u00b0), than their co-polar counterparts by more than -25 dB. However, due to the s-polar fields of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna o the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are higher than those of the reference dielectric resonator antenna.\n\n[0053] In another embodiment, a wideband dual-fre- quency antenna, based on the antenna configuration of FIGS. 1A and 1C, integrating a wideband dielectric resona- tor antenna and wideband Fabry-Perot resonator antenna is investigated. In this embodiment, in the microwave part, the wide bandwidth is obtained by merging TE,,,* and TE,,;* modes of the dielectric resonator antenna. For the millime- ter-wave part, the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna mode and two L-probe modes are simultaneously excited and merged to enhance the bandwidth.\n\n[0054] FIG. 7 is a picture of the designed wideband dual-fed dual-frequency antenna prototype 300, with the dimensions shown in Table II.

As compared with the reference wideband dielectric resonator antenna, the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 has a more stable antenna gain across the frequency range of interest.\n\nTABLE II\n\nDimensions of the Wideband Dual-Frequency Antenna Parameter le Wo lp W ly d He Value 150 22 2 LS 5 71 4 (mm)\n\n[0059] FIG. 11 shows the measured antenna efliciency wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna FIG. 7, varying from 74.6% to 95.4% in the 10\n\nof\n\nthe of\n\n300 dB\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0066789 Al\n\n5\n\nimpedance frequency band , which shows the wideband\n\nbroadly described .

The described embodiments of the inven- tion should therefore be considered in all respects as illus- trative, not restrictive. The expressions \u201cvertical\u201d, \u201chorizon- tal\u201d, \u201cbase\u201d, \u201ctop\u201d, and like expressions in the above disclosure are merely used for illustrative purpose and in a relative sense to describe the antenna in a particular orien- tation.\n\nimpedance frequency band, which shows the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 is high efficient antenna even with a groove along its center.\n\n[0060] The wideband Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 is now studied. FIG. 12 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the wide- band Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7. With reference to FIG. 12, the measured and simulated impedance bandwidths of the current Fabry-Perot resonator antenna are 16.18% (23.23-27.32 GHz) and 18.99% (23.21-28.08 GHz), respectively. The measured result has a narrower bandwidth. The discrepancy between the two results may be due to fabrication errors of the L-probe.\n\n[0066] For example, the antenna may not be a dual- frequency antenna, but a multi-frequency antenna. The antenna can be excited to selectively operate as one type (frequency band) of antenna at a time or excited to simul- taneously operate as two or more types (different frequency bands) of antennas. The antenna may be operable in other frequency/wave bands, not necessarily millimeter and microwave bands. The dielectric resonator antenna need not be a microwave dielectric resonator antenna and the Fabry- Perot resonator antenna need not be a millimeter wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. The antenna and its compo- nents (the ground plane, the dielectric block, the excitation members, etc.) can have size, shape, geometry, or form different from those illustrated. For example, the ground plane need not be rectangular, and need not be arranged on the side of the dielectric block opposite the groove. The dielectric block need not be rectangular; the groove need not be extending between opposite ends of the dielectric block. The conductor can be conductor strips such as copper strips. Depending on construction and application, the antenna can be excited to different operation modes including those not specifically described. The antenna can support 4G, 5G, or\n\n[0061] FIGS. 13A and 13B show the measured and simu- ated radiation patterns of the wideband Fabry-Perot reso- nator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 at 24 GHz. It can be seen from FIGS. 13A and 13B that a reasonable agree- ment between the measured and simulated results is obtained. A distortion and asymmetry in the measured H-plane co-polar pattern is observed. This may be due to imperfections of the test setup. At both frequencies (or frequency bands), the co-polar fields are stronger than their cross-polar counterparts by more than 25 dB.\n\n[0062] FIG. 14 shows the measured and simulated bore- sight antenna gains of the wideband Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7. As shown in FIG. 14, the measured and simulated peak gains are 11.30 and 11.93 dBi respectively. Both the measured and simulated results are consistently higher than 10 dBi across the impedance passband.\n\n1. An antenna, comprising:\n\na dielectric block with a groove, and a conductor arranged in the groove;\n\n[0063] FIG. 15 shows the total antenna efficiency of the wideband Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7, which is obtained from the measured realized gain and directivity. FIG. 15 shows that the total antenna efli- ciency varies from 56.5% to 86.4% over the 10 dB imped- ance bandwidth. The highest efficiency of 86.4% is lower than that (95.4%) of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna, which is acceptable because the Fabry-Perot reso- nator antenna operates at a much higher frequency.\n\nwherein the antenna is arranged to be excited to operate as a dielectric resonator antenna and a Fabry-Perot resonator antenna.\n\n2. The antenna of claim 1, wherein the dielectric block is substantially solid.\n\n3. The antenna of claim 1, wherein the groove extends through the dielectric block from a first end of the dielectric block to a second end of the dielectric block, the first and second ends being opposite ends.\n\n[0064] The above embodiments of the inventive provide various dual-fed dual-frequency dielectric antennas. In some embodiments, the antenna include a single dielectric block with a groove along its center, and is operable (when excited at the corresponding port) as one or both of the microwave dielectric resonator antenna and millimeter-wave Fabry- Perot resonator antenna. The resonant frequencies of the dielectric resonator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna can be determined independently for fabrication, making it easy to achieve a large frequency ratio (widely- separated frequency/wave bands). Also, the antenna, by artfully integrating the microwave dielectric resonator antenna with the millimeter-wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna into one antenna, can be made compact and light. In some embodiments, the antenna is particularly useful for 4G, 5G, 6G, 7G, etc., frequency bands. The antenna of the various embodiments can be used in different communica- tion systems such as RF systems, microwave systems, or wireless systems, and in different communication devices\n\n4.
