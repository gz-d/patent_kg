Each of the compartments may include an inlet 108 connecting to the respective compartments for directing solutions thereinto. The detector 100 may also include a pair of electrodes 110 inserted into the compartments 106A and. 106B, contacting with the solutions retained in the compart- ments. The electrodes 110 are electrically connected to an external circuit thereby forming a conductive path defined by the electrodes, the solutions retained in the individual and the substance selection structure.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION I\n\n[0041] Cancer is one of the mortal diseases in the world and its early detection is essential to improve successful treatment and reduce cancer mortality. Fortunately, long term survival is possible if patients present at an early stage. Thus, diagnostic tools enabling the screening test of cancer become of paramount importance.\n\n[0042] In view of the above, it may be desirable to have a low cost cancer screening in the asymptomatic general population. However, it is appreciated that many of the screening methods/devices used in the art require invasive sample collection or time-consuming analysis, whilst both of which may further require a trained person to operate.\n\n[0048] The substance selection structure 104 may selec- tively interact with a target substance 112 in the solutions. Upon interaction, one or more molecules of the target substance may be captured by the substance selection struc- ture, rendering a reduction of quantity of the target substance in the solution. As a result, the electrical characteristic of the conductive path is altered. Thus, the presence and/or the amount of the cancer biomarkers in a sample may be indicated based on the electrical characteristic altered by the interaction.\n\n[0043] The inventors have, through their own research, trials and experiments, devised that aptamers (ie. RNA or DNA oligonucleotides or peptides) possess structural domains that are capable of recognizing a wide variety of targets such as ions, toxins, bacteria, viruses, cells, and tissues with high selectivity and sensitivity. In addition, the aptamers can be functionalized on different material easily. Thus, an electrochemical detector containing said aptamers may be desirable to provide a low cost, highly selective, and highly sensitive cancer screening.\n\n[0049] The substance selection structure 104 may include a plurality of receptors arranged to bind with the target substance 112 that are in contact with the substance selection structure. Preferably, the plurality of receptors is specific to the target substance, forming a physical interaction with the target substance upon contact, thereby capturing the target substance. For example, the plurality of receptors may form at least one of electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic inter- actions, or a complementary shape with the target substance upon contact.\n\nembodiment of an electrochemical detector comprising a solution chamber and a substance selection structure sepa- rating the chamber into individual compartments, the solu- tion chamber is arranged to retain and separate solutions in each of the individual compartments; and a pair of elec- trodes each connecting the respective individual compart- ment, wherein the pair of electrodes is arranged to form a conductive path across the electrodes when in contact with the solutions retained in the solution chamber; wherein the substance selection structure is arranged to interact with a target substance in the solution so as to alter an electrical characteristic of the conductive path defined by the pair of electrodes, the solution retained in the individual compart- ments in the solution chamber and the substance selection\n\n[0050] plurality receptors may arranged on a porous layer. The porous layer may act as a support or a substrate allowing the receptors to accommodate thereon. The porous layer may be of any size that allows it to be fitted into the solution chamber 102. Preferably, the porous layer may be a polymeric layer or a metallic layer with nanopores. The nanopores may be introduced to the polymeric layer or metallic layer by reported techniques such as track-etching, ion bean sculpting, electron beam sculpting and the like. Advantageously, with the presence of the nanopores, the porous layer provides a large surface area for accommodat- ing a large amount of receptors, which may increase the chance of the target substance being captured by the recep-\n\n[0045] In this embodiment, the electrochemical detector 100 may be used for detecting a cancer biomarker in a sample.

The substance selection structure com- prises a porous layer 202 deposited with an active layer 204. The active layer 204 is seeded with a plurality of coupling agents 206. A plurality of receptors 208 are arranged to couple with the coupling agents 206 and are arranged to interact with a target substance 112.\n\nof the porous layer. The porous layer may be modified with a layer of active material, which allows seeding a plurality of coupling agents thereon. The coupling agent may have one or more functional groups that can form at least one covalent bond with the receptors and the porous layer, thereby anchoring the receptors onto the porous layer. For example, the coupling agent may have at least one of a hydroxyl group, a sulfhydryl group, an amino group, a siloxane group or a carboxyl group forming at least one covalent bond with the receptors and the porous layer. Detailed structural arrangement of the substance selection structure will be discussed in later part of this disclosure.\n\n[0059] In this example, the porous layer 202 may be a polycarbonate (PC) membrane or an aluminium membrane with a plurality of nanopores. The membrane 202 may have a morphology as shown in FIG. 3A. As shown, the nanopo- res are distributed non-uniformly on a smooth membrane surface. The membrane 202 may have a thickness of about 7 hm and its pores may have a pore size of about 50 nm. It is appreciated that a skilled person may vary the thickness and pore size of the membrane according to their needs.\n\n[0052] In operation, the electrochemical detector 100 may be implemented as a solution chamber 102 including a first portion 102A and a second portion 102B. The first and the second portions may be detachably connecting with each other to form an enclosed chamber 102. The first and the second portions may be connected with each other by any suitable external means. For example, the two portions may be connected with each other by screwing them together with a plurality of screws.\n\n[0060] The membrane 202 is deposited with the active layer 204. The active layer 204 may act as a platform to seed/to accommodate the coupling agent 206. The active layer 204 may comprise any material that is capable o reacting with at least one of the functional groups of the coupling agent 206. Preferably, the active layer 204 is a gold nano-layer. The gold nano-layer 204 may be deposited on the membrane 202 by reported methods such as spin coating, vapor deposition, dip coating and the like. In this example, the gold nano-layer 204 may have a thickness of about 10 mm. As shown in FIG. 3B, after deposited with the gold nano-layer, the smooth porous membrane 202 is covered with a layer of gold nanoparticles, forming a rough layer thereon.\n\n[0053] The enclosed chamber 102 may include a compart- ment 106 for retaining solutions. The compartment is sepa- rated by the substance selection structure 104 disposed between the first and the second portions of the chamber, such that the compartment 106 is petitioned into two indi- vidual compartments 106A and 106B for retaining different solutions.\n\n[0054] Optionally or additionally, an O-ring (not shown) may be disposed opposite to a side where the substance selection structure 104 interacts with the target substance 112 for preventing any solution leaking from the respective compartments.\n\n[0061] As mentioned, the coupling agents 206 arranged to couple the receptors with the membrane 202. this example, the coupling agent may be an alkyl compound including at least one functional group that is capable coupling with the receptors 208 and the active layer 204.\n\n[0055] To perform measurement, the electrochemical detector 100 is connected to an external circuit through the electrodes 110. The electrodes may be made of any conduc- tive materials that are not reactive to the target substance 112. Preferably, the electrodes are made of noble metal such as platinum, gold and the like.\n\n[0062] The alkyl compound may have a carbon chain of 4 to 6 carbons with the functional groups arranged on each enc of the carbon chain. The functional groups may be identical or different from each other. Preferably, the coupling agent includes an alkyl compound having a 6C carbon chain with different functional groups arranged on each end of the carbon chain. More preferably, the 6C alkyl compoun includes a hydroxyl group and a sulfhydryl group on each end of the compound. Most preferably, the coupling agent is 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH).\n\n[0056] A sample solution containing the target substance 112 and a reference solution may be added to the compart- ments 106A and 106B, respectively. The solutions may be added to the compartments with a predetermined volume. Preferably, the volume added to the compartments may be minimal, such as 1-2 mL. Depending on how the front side of the substance selection structure 104 is oriented (i.e. whether the side with the plurality of receptors is oriented towards the left or right end of the detector), the sample solution may be added to the compartment 106A or 106B through the inlets 108. In this example, the plurality of receptors is oriented towards the left end of the detector and therefore the sample solution 107A is added to the compart- ment 106A whereas the reference 107B is added to the compartment 106B.\n\n[0063] The MCH 206 on the one hand may form a gold-sulphur bond with the gold nano-layer 204 through the sulfhydryl group thereby allowing itself to accommodate on the membrane 202. On the other hand, the MCH 206 may form a covalent bond with the receptors 208 through the hydroxyl group such that the receptors are bridged/anchored. to the membrane 202.\n\n[0064] The receptors 208 may be any compounds with a functional group that can specifically bind to the target substance 112; or any biological molecules that can specifi- cally interact with/capture the target substance 112. In particular, the receptors 208 may be a biological molecule that is specific to a biomarker of a cancer such as an antigen of a particular cancer. In this example, the biological mol- ecule 208 may be an aptamer (i.e. an oligo-RNA/DNA or a peptide) that can specifically capture an antigen of a cancer 112. Preferably, the biological molecule 208 is an oligo- RNA containing a sequence that is specific to the antigen of\n\n[0057] The target substance 112 in the sample solution 107A may by captured by the substance selection structure 104 when they are in contact. Thus, the amount of target substance in the sample solution is reduced, rendering a reduction of conductivity of the sample solution 107A with respect to the reference solution 107B. As such, the current flow across the electrodes is reduced accordingly. By mea- suring such alteration in current over time (i.e. current flow), the amount of target substance in the sample solution may be determined.\n\nare\n\nIn\n\nof\n\nMay 6 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0131995 A1\n\n4\n\nform a gold - sulphur bond to couple with the gold nano - layer .\n\ngastric cancer .

The oligo-RNA 208 may form a physical interaction with the antigen 112 when they are in close proximity or in contact with each other. Preferably, the oligo-RNA 208 may form at least one of the electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions or a complementary shape with the antigen 112. By this capturing process, the amount of the antigen in the sample solution would be reduced, thereby altering the conductivity of the sample solution and the amount of current flow from the sample solution to the reference solution in the electrochemical detector 100.\n\nAny excess (ie. unreacted) MCH may be removed by washing the membrane surface with suitable solvents.\n\n[0071] Finally, at step 403, a plurality of receptors 208 may be immobilized on the membrane 202 by reacting with the coupling agent 206. In this example, a solution contain- ing a predetermined amount of oligo-RNA may be spin coated or dip coated on the gold-coated membrane modified. with MCH 206. The oligo-RNA 208 may react with the hydroxyl group of MCH by forming a covalent bond there- with. As such, the oligo-RNAs are immobilized on the membrane. After the immobilization process, the membrane may be washed with suitable solvents such as 1x PBS (pH 7.4) followed by distilled water to remove any unreacted oligo-RNA.\n\n[0065] Without being limited by the above example, it is appreciated that the substance selection structure 104 may be applied to capture other cancer biomarkers so as to detect different types of cancer. This may be done by simply replacing the receptors 208 with other aptamers that is specific to the antigen of the cancer of interest.\n\n[0072] Optionally or additionally, after the substance selection structure 104 is fabricated, the positive immobili- zation of the receptors 208 and their ability of detecting the target substance 112 may be determined by step 404. At this step, a solution of the target substance 112 that is specific to the receptors 208 may be added on the substance selection structure 104 and examined by reported techniques such as AFM. In this example, the oligo-RNA (i.e. the receptors) is specific to an antigen of gastric cancer CA72-4. A PBS solution of CA72-4 may be added on the membrane fol- lowed by being examined with AFM. As shown in FIG. 5B, a plurality of sharp peaks 504 may be observed as compared with the \u201cbare\u201d gold-coated PC membrane (FIG. 5A), indi- cating that there is a positive immobilization of the oligo- RNA and the detection of CA72-4.\n\n[0066] The use of a coupling agent may be advantageous in facilitating the coupling of the receptors to the membrane. For example, in some cases, the receptors may not have a functional group that is reactive enough to react with the active layer; thereby a harsh reaction condition may be required to anchor/immobilize the receptors on the mem- brane. Such a harsh reaction condition may cause deterio- ration to the receptors, particularly when the receptors are nucleotides or peptides, rendering a reduction or a loss of function of the receptors.\n\n[0067] By the use of a coupling agent with functional groups that are reactive toward both the receptors and the membrane, the reaction condition required would become milder, increasing the chance of preserving the functionality of the receptors. In addition, the coupling agent may prevent cross-linking between adjacent receptors, particularly when the receptors are aptamers (i.e. oligo-RNA, oligo-DNA or peptides). Thus, the binding between the receptors and the target substance would not be hindered by said cross- linking.\n\n[0073] With reference to FIGS. 6A to 6D, there is shown an example embodiment of detecting an antigen of gastric cancer, CA72-4 using the electrochemical detector 100. In this example, the electrochemical detector may be imple- mented as a cylindrical plastic solution chamber 602 (FIGS. 6A and 6B). The chamber has a length of 60 mm and a diameter of 50 mm. Such compact size of the detector may advantageously allow a user to carry the detector easily so as to carry out operations such as point-to-point diagnosis.\n\n[0068] With reference to FIG. 4, there is shown a method of fabrication of the substance selection structure 104. The method 400 comprises three main steps. The method may commence at step 401 where a porous layer 202 is deposited with a layer of active material 204. In this example, the porous layer is a track-etched polycarbonate (PC) mem- brane. The membrane may have a thickness of about 7 um and pore size of about 50 nm. The nanoporous PC membrane may be deposited with a gold nano-layer 204 of about 10 mm. The deposition process may be performed by reported methods such as spin coating, dip coating, vapour deposition and the like.\n\n[0074] On the top of the chamber 602, there are provided with two pairs of pores that are symmetrically arranged with respect to the virtual axis 603. With reference to FIG. 6B, the pores 604A and 604B arranged close to each end of the chamber are inlets for directing solutions into the chamber for operation; whereas the pores (604C, 604D) close to the virtual axis 603 are where the electrodes placed for opera- tion. Preferably, the pores 604C and 604D are spaced apart from each other by 20 mm.\n\n[0075] Turning to the inside of the chamber, there is provided a compartment 606 for retaining solutions. In this example, the compartment has a diameter of 7 mm (FIG. 6A). The compartment 606 is separated by a chemically modified PC membrane 608, with a diameter of 22 mm, into two individual compartments 606A and 606B. Each of the individual compartments is connected to respective inlets for retaining the solution directed therefrom. In this example, the compartment 606A is fluidly connected to inlet 604A whereas the compartment 606B is fluidly connected to inlet 604B.\n\n[0069] Optionally or additionally, the deposition of the gold nano-layer 204 on the PC membrane 202 may be confirmed by reported analysis techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in FIG. 5A, the PC membrane 202 that is successfully deposited with the gold nano-layer 204 may have a plurality of grain-like structures 502 substantially uniformly distributed on the membrane, resulting in a rough surface.\n\n[0070] The method may then proceed to step 402 where the gold-coated membrane is modified with a coupling agent 206. In this example, the coupling agent is MCH. The coupling agent may be deposited on the gold nano-layer 204 by spin coating. For example, a solution containing a predetermined amount of MCH may be spin coated on the gold nano-layer. The sulfhydryl group of MCH may then\n\n[0076] The PC membrane 608 is modified with a plurality oligo-RNA for capturing the antigens of gastric cancer sample solution.

The two portions may be screwed to form an enclosed chamber by four screws arranged circumferentially on the chamber.

Furthermore, by fitting the measured current against the concentrations of the antigen as shown in FIG. 7B, the detection limit and the sensitivity of the detector are determined. In this example, the detection limit is determined to be 4 UmL~! whereas the sensitivity is determined to be 0.384895 wAU~! mLcm -2. With such selectivity and sensitivity, a blood sample may be directly applied to the detector for analysis without any extra extraction processes that may cause loss of sample.\n\n[0078] In operation, an O-ring 610 is placed within the chamber for preventing solution leakage from any gaps between the two portions (602A, 602B). Referring to FIG. 6D, the O-ring may be placed in a recess surrounding an opening of one of the individual compartments. Preferably, the O-ring is placed in the recess surrounding the opening of the compartment 606A, which is arranged to retain a refer- ence solution. In this way, when the two portions (602A, 602B) are screwed together, any gaps between the openings of the compartment 606A and the compartment 606B is sealed from the outside, thereby minimizing the chance of solution leakage from these compartments.\n\n[0083] The electrochemical detector of the present inven- tion is advantageous in that it may be implemented in portable electronic devices and hand-held sensors which may be used in domestic applications so as to provide a point-of-care service to the patients. The low-voltage (2V) operation of the electrochemical apparatus ensures chemical stability (no induced electrolysis) of analyte solutions.\n\n[0079] The chemically modified PC membrane 608 is placed on top of the O-ring 610, with the surface function- alized with the oligo-RNA receptors facing toward the opening of the compartment 606B. As shown in FIG. 6D, the membrane 608 may have a size that is sufficient to cover both the openings of the compartments (606A, 606B) and at least part of cross-section surface of the chamber 602. In this way, when the two portions (602A, 602B) are screwed together, the membrane 608 is sandwiched and fixed ther- ebetween. As such, the antigens in the sample solution retained by the compartment 606B are captured by the receptors as discussed in the earlier part of this disclosure.\n\n[0085] In addition, the membrane may be easily tuned selectively sensing the antigens of other types of cancer, target substances such as viruses, nanoparticles, and the like, by simply fabricating different aptamers the membrane.\n\n[0086] Furthermore, the fabrication process is also simple and the electrochemical detector may be readily fabricated using different simple fabrication processes including low- cost fabrication methods such as printing and solution processing with low-cost materials. The fabrication of the electrochemical apparatuses may be easily scaled up. Also, the detector only requires a minimal amount of sample (i.e. 1 mL) for each measurement. In this way, the each mea- surement may be replicated for several times thereby mini- mizing the effect of measurement error.\n\n[0080] To perform the measurement, a PBS reference solution (1 mL) and a PBS solution containing the antigen (1 mL) are injected into the compartments 606A and 606B via the inlets 604A and 604B, respectively. A pair of platinum electrodes is inserted into the pores 604C and 604D to contact with the aforesaid sample and reference solutions. The pair of electrodes is further electrically con- nected to an external circuit with an ammeter so as to measure the change of current flow across the electrodes when the antigens are captured by the receptors on the membrane. The concentration of antigen in the sample solution is reflected by the magnitude of current measured.\n\n[0087] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.\n\n[0081] With reference to FIGS. 7A and 7B, there is shown two plots of a response of the electrochemical detector 100 in accordance with the embodiment as discussed in FIG. 6. As shown in FIG. 7A, the current across the electrodes decreases for each time the antigens are captured by the oligo-RNA receptors functionalized on the PC membrane. In particular, when the concentration of the antigen increases, the magnitude of current reduction increases accordingly, suggesting a substantially linear correlation between the antigen concentration and the current magnitude, which is in good agree with the electrophoretic transport theory.\n\n[0088] Any reference to prior art contained herein is not to be taken as an admission that the information is common general knowledge, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n1.

As shown in FIG. 7B, the electrochemical detector 100 only showed a decrease in the measured current with respect to the increasing concentration of the target antigen (CA72-4 in this example).
