The compound of the present invention may be referred to as KPlip.\n\n[0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/040,060 filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jun. 17, 2020 and entitled \u201cCOMPOUND AND A METHOD FOR IDEN- TIFYING A PROTEIN USING SAID COMPOUND,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.\n\n[0009] Preferably, the compound is a compound of for- mula of R,\u2014X, wherein X is a lysine-containing peptide with at least one (preferably 1) lysine within the peptide being substituted with a lipoyl group, and R, comprises a photo-crosslinking group attached to the lysine containing peptide via a carbonyl group.\n\n[0002] The present invention relates to compounds for use in detecting \u201creader\u201d and \u201ceraser\u201d proteins of lysine lipoy- lation. The present invention also pertains to a method of identifying a protein using said compounds.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0010] In certain embodiments the R, group is attached at the N-terminus of the lysine-containing peptide X.\n\n[0003] Lysine lipoylation is a posttranslational modifica- tion (PTM) of a lysine residue. Lysine PTMs are highly prevalent in living organisms and play an important role in regulating diverse biological processes such as gene tran- scription, DNA repair, chromatin structure modulation and metabolism. Lysine lipoylation is a highly conserved lysine PTM found in a broad range of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. Functionally, lipoylated lysine is known to act as an essential cofactor for maintaining the activity of essential metabolic multimeric enzyme com- plexes, such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Dysregulation of lysine lipoylation leads to malfunctions of metabolic complexes and numerous diseases.\n\n[0011] In certain embodiments X comprises a peptide sequence of a protein selected from branched-chain a-ke- toacid dehydrogenase (BC! genase (KDH), pyruvate cleavage complex (GCV), KDH), a-ketoglutarate dehydro- dehydrogenase (PDH), glycine and histone.\n\n[0012] In certain embo group. iments R, further contains\n\n[0013] sequence of a protein sele toacid dehydrogenase (BC! genase (KDH), pyruvate cleavage complex (GCV), tains an alkynyl group. In certain embodiments X comprises a peptide cted from branched-chain a-ke- KDH), a-ketoglutarate dehydro- dehydrogenase (PDH), glycine or histone; and R, further con-\n\n[0004] Biological regulations of lysine lipoylation depend on proteins that function as the \u201cwriters\u201d, \u201creaders\u201d and \u201cerasers\u201d of lysine lipoylation. Dissecting lysine lipoylation at the proteomic level can reveal potential drug targets in the dynamic regulation of cellular metabolism. Thus, it is desir- able to identify proteins that bind or remove lysine lipoy- lation.\n\n[0014] In certain embodi ments Ri is:\n\n[0005] In a recent article, Cristea et al. discovered that Sirt4 could interact with the PDH complex using immu- noenrichment methods. The study revealed that Sirt4 is the first mammalian enzyme that can modulate PDH activity through delipoylation in living cells. However, it was noted that the delipoylation activity of Sirt4 in vitro was rather weak, especially when compared with the deacetylation activity of sirtuins. This raises an question: whether there are other enzymes that can erase lysine lipoylation more efli- ciently in the native cellular environment.\n\n[0015] wherein R, is a photo-crosslinking group.\n\n[0016] In certain embodiments, R, is a C5 straight alkyl chain substituted with diazirine, phenyl azide, ortho-hy- droxyphenyl azide, meta-hydroxyphenyl azide, tetrafluoro- phenyl azide, ortho-nitrophenyl azide, meta-nitrophenyl azide, azido-methylcoumarin, or psoralen.\n\n[0006] To this end, the present invention provides a robust chemical tool to aid in understanding the biological func- tions of lysine lipoylation. Specifically, the present invention provides a compound, the first aflinity-based probe, referred to herein as \u201cKPlip\u201d, capable of interrogating the lipoylated peptide/protein interactions under native cellular environ- ments. The chemical probe allows for the identification of potential regulators of lysine lipoylation, thus uncovering new biology related to lipoylation.\n\n[0017] In certain embodiments the photo-crosslinking group comprises a diazirine.\n\n[0018] In certain embodiments R, is:\n\n[0007] Until now, no single-step fluorescent probe has been developed to report delipoylation activity. The present invention also provides a fluorogenic probe, KTlip, to detect delipoylation activity in a continuous manner.

The probes (10 1M) were incubated with live HEK 293 cells or cell lysates for 2 h. Following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the KPlip/KPlip-C-labelled proteomes were clicked with biotin azide, enriched by affinity purification, tesolved by SDS-PAGE, and finally analysed by LC-MS/ MS. Upon removal of nonspecific binding proteins identi- fied from the control probe KPlip-C, only the proteins that were positively identified in both lysate and live-cell experi- ments were chosen as potential targets. This led to a probe-\n\n[0066] Lysine lipoylation (Klip) is a highly conserved lysine PTM found in bacteria, viruses, and mammals. It plays a critical role in regulating cell metabolism. Klip is reported to occur on several essential metabolic multimeric complexes, including the branched-chain a-ketoacid dehy- drogenase complex (BCKDH), the a-ketoglutarate dehydro- genase complex (KDH), the pyruvate dehydrogenase com- plex (PDH), and the glycine cleavage complex (GCV). Klip is required as an essential cofactor for maintaining the activity of these enzyme complexes. Malfunction of the lipoylated metabolic complexes, on the other hand, can lead diseases. For loss of PDH\n\n[0071] A series of competition experiments was per- formed to further identify the high-specificity binders of\n\nto\n\nof\n\nis\n\na\n\nin\n\ncells\n\n[0065]\n\nPost-translational modifications (PTMs) of lysine\n\nattracted increasing attention in recent years.\n\nto numerous\n\ninstance,\n\nlipoylation\n\nhas\n\ndis-\n\n(FIG. 15) was\n\nalso synsthesised.\n\n[0070]\n\nUsing the two probes (KPlip and KPlip-C).

The treated cells were UV-irradiated and subjected to click reaction with biotin azide (Bio-N;). The cells were then lysed and enriched with streptavidin beads. The enriched proteins were finally analysed by Western blotting with anti-Sirt2. As shown in FIG. 4, Sirt2 was successfully pulled down by KPlip. In contrast, Sirt2 was not observed in the absence of probe or with the control probe (KPlip-C) (FIG. 4). These results unambiguously demonstrated that endogenous Sirt2 may be pulled down by lipoylated pep- tides under a native cellular environment. In addition, a pull-down assay was also performed to validate the binding of HDAC8/BRMSIL to Klip. The results showed that both proteins may be effectively pulled down by KPlip. This is consistent with the LC-MS/MS results.\n\nKPlip. HEK 293 cell lysates were preincubated with DMSO or a lipoylated peptide competitor (VQSDK,,ASVT, FIG. 1c) at 100 1M. Subsequently the lysates were labelled with probe KPlip (10 UMD by UV irradiation. The probe-labelled proteomes were then conjugated with biotin azide, enriched by streptavidin beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin, and finally analysed by label-free LC-MS/MS quantitation. High-specificity binders of KPlip were defined as those showing substantial signal decrease (3-fold) in the presence of the competitor. This led to a total of 588 proteins identified. The proteins identified in both the probe-selec- tivity and competition experiments were compared resulting in a high-confidence list of 67 KPlip-binding proteins.\n\n[0072] A gene ontology (GO) analysis of the high-confi- dence KPlip-binding proteins was then conducted. The analysis revealed that a variety of biological processes, such as cellular lipid catabolic process and acyl-CoA metabolic process, were significantly enriched.\n\n[0078] These experiments confirm that KPlip is a reliable for chemical proteomics to dissect proteins interacting with lipoylated lysine.\n\n[0073] Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2), a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC), was identi- fied following the analysis as a promising KPlip-binding protein.\n\nExample 5: Delipoylation Study with Probe KTlip\n\n[0079] After confirming the interactions of Sirt2 and the lipoylated peptide of the present invention in a cellular context, the capability of Sirt2 to remove a lipoyl modifi- cation was investigated. To this end, a fluorescent probe of the present invention detected delipoylation activity. Com- pared with mass spectrometry, radioisotopes, specific anti- bodies, and HPLC, fluorescent probes possess prominent advantages in detecting enzyme activity, such as high sen- sitivity and simple procedure. Previously, no single-step fluorescent probe has been developed to report delipoylation activity. It has been difficult to design single-step fluorescent probes for detecting deacylation activity because the ali- phatic amide structure in the Kacy] group does not allow conjugation to a fluorophore.\n\nExample 3: In-Gel Labelling of KPlip\n\n[0074] The labelling efficiency of KPlip with recombinant Sirt2 was investigated. The Sirt2 enzyme was first incubated with either KPlip or a negative control probe, KPlip-C (lacking lipoylation), followed by 15 min of UV irradiation. Following click chemistry with rhodamine azide (Rh-N;), the reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analysed by in-gel fluorescence scanning. The results showed that Sirt2 was labelled by KPlip efficiently, whereas no labelling was observed in the control probe KPlip-C, indicating that Sirt2 interacted with the probe KPlip by specifically recognizing the Klip moiety. Time-dependent experiments showed that 2 min UV irradiation resulted in intense labelling. The fluorescence intensity of the labelled Sirt2 band increased when the concentrations of the probe increased, demonstrating that probe KPlip labelled the target protein in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\n[0080] The present invention employed a fluorescent probe based on an intramolecular reaction strategy to detect deacetylation activity. As such, a fluorogenic probe, KTlip, was prepared for profiling delipoylation activity in vitro. As shown in FIG. 5, the probe consisted of a recognition group, Klip, and an O-NBD moiety. Without being bound by theory it is believed that when enzymes hydrolyze the lipoyl group, the released amine will attack the O-NBD, yielding N-NBD, and turn on the fluorescence (FIG. 5). Such a probe may report the delipoylation activity of enzymes continuously and reliably.\n\n[0075] A further selectivity study was performed. This study revealed that the probe, KPlip, labelled Sirt2 more strongly than other sirtuins did, confirming that Sirt2 rec- ognizes lipoylated lysine more preferentially than other sirtuins do. To examine whether lipoic acid of KPlip forms a disulfide bond with cysteine residues in Sirt2, excessive reducing reagent TCEP was added to the solution containing Sirt2 and KPlip prior to UV irradiation. No diminished effect of Sirt2 labelling was observed, suggesting the labelling of Sirt2 by probe KPlip was not redox-based. Moreover, the labelling of Sirt2 can be inhibited by a lipoylated peptide competitor (VQSDK,,,ASVT, FIG. 1c), verifying that the interaction between Sirt2 and lipoylated peptide is selective and direct.\n\n[0081] The capacity of HDACs to recognize and remove the lipoyl group of KTlip was examined by a fluorimeter assay. KTlip was incubated with various HDACs at 37\u00b0 C. in HEPES buffer (pH 8.0). The fluorescence of the enzy- matic reactions was then measured accordingly.\n\n[0082] As shown in FIG. 6, Sirt2 showed the strongest fluorescence increment, with 60-fold fluorescence increase. Sirtl showed a much lower fluorescence signal, whereas Sirt3, Sirt5, Sirt6, and HDAC8 did not show a noticeable fluorescence increase. The control group without cofactor NAD+ displayed negligible fluorescence, indicating that the reaction occurred through enzymatic catalysis. Further HPLC and MS analysis confirmed that the molecular weight of the newly generated peak corresponded to the expected tandem de-lipoylated/exchanged product. No de-lipoylated product was observed under the enzymatic reaction condi- tions for HDACS8. After enzymatic reaction with Sirt2, a shift of peak absorption from 380 nm to 480 nm was clearly\n\nExample 4: Pull-Down Validation of KPlip\n\n[0076] Live-cell labelling with KPlip was performed. As shown in FIG. 3, several major bands were fluorescently labelled.

Through detailed kinetic study, the first-order rate constant of the reaction was determined to be 0.013 min-1. The Km value of KTlip obtained from the fluorescent method matched well with that from the traditional HPLC method, underscoring that probe KTlip can serve as a useful tool for detecting enzymatic delipoylation activity. These data revealed that Sirt2 displays robust activity to remove the lipoyl group in vitro.\n\n[0084] Control experiments without the addition of NAD+ and enzyme unambiguously proved that the hydrolysis reac- tion is attributed to enzymatic activities rather than other environmental factors. In addition, the newly generated peak of KAlip-1 with Sirt2 showed the same retention time as the unmodified peptide (FIG. 3F). The delipoylation activity of HDAC8was further examined using KAlip-5 and KAlip-1. No delipoylated product was observed. The enzymatic delipoylation results by fluorescent probe KTlip and lipoy- lated peptides KAlip-5 and KAlip-1 together indicated that HDACS8 has no delipoylation activity.\n\nExample 6\u2014Delipoylation Study with Various Lipoylated Peptides\n\n[0085] A more detailed assessment of the enzymatic delipoylation reaction was performed. Time-dependent experiments and steady-state kinetics studies were con- ducted of KAlip-1, 5, 8, and 10 with Sirt2 (Table 1). Kinetics data (Table 1) revealed that the catalytic efliciency (K.,,/K,,,) for delipoylation activity of Sirt2 is of the same order of magnitude as that of the deacetylation of Sirt1-2, the desuc- cinylation/demalonylation of Sirt5, and the demyristoylation of\n\nwhether sirtuins exhibit substrate specificity in recognizing different peptide sequences. A total of 11 lipoylated peptides (KAlip-1 to KAlip-11) were synthesised. The peptide sequences were selected from proteins that have been reported as being lipoylated (PDH, KDH, BCKDH, and GCV) and non-lipoylated proteins (e.g., histone). The pep- tides were synthesized with a standard Fmoc solid phase synthesis approach and characterized by LC-MS. The delipoylation activity was then determined by an HPLC assay. Sirt2 catalysed the removal of the lipoyl group for all the peptides tested, as shown in Table 1. Compared with non-putative peptides, putative lipoylated peptides appeared to be more efficiently hydrolyzed by Sirt2. For example, the delipoylated product of KAlip-1 (derived from histone) after 40 min was determined to be 59%, which is less than that of putative lipoylated substrates such as KAlip-5 and KAlip-6 (derived from PDH). Near absolute delipoylation was observed for KAlip-5 and KAlip-8 within just 15 min, signifying that Sirt2 catalyzed the removal of the lipoyl\n\n[0086] Sirt6 in vitro. The catalytic efliciency of Sirt2 toward the putative lipoylated peptides (KAlip-5, 8, 10) was slightly higher than toward the nonputative H3K9 lipoyl peptide (KAlip-1). Strikingly, the catalytic efficiency of Sirt2 (K,,,/K,,) to delipoylate DLAT K259 of the PDH complex (KAlip-5) is approximately 426-fold higher than that of Sirt4.\n\n[0087] Taken together, these in vitro enzymology demonstrated that Sirt2 is a robust delipoylating enzyme.\n\nExample 7\u2014Sirt2 Removes Klip from Lipoylated DLAT Protein\n\n[0088] An experiment was performed to test whether Sirt2 delipoylates protein substrates.

Pyruvate dehydroge- nase E2 (DLAT) (NM_001931) human recombinant protein was sourced from ORIGENE. Streptavidin magnetic beads were purchased from New England Biolabs. In-gel fluores- cence scanning experiments were performed with a FLA- 9000 Fujifilm scanner. Antibody of Sirt2 (D4S6J) was from Cell Signaling. Antibodies of DLAT (ab172617), lipoic acid (ab58724), HDAC8 (ab187139), BRMSIL (ab107171), and Hsp60 (ab128567) were from Abeam.

Lipoylated PDH is responsible for converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, a central metabolite that enters into the TCA cycle. On the other hand, the delipoylation of PDH impairs its activity. Although the cellular localization of Sirt2 was conventionally annotated to be in the cytosol/ nucleus, recent literature has suggested that Sirt2 could localize to mitochondria and regulate the functions of mito- chondrial proteins. Sirt2 was detected in a mitochondrial fraction isolated from Hela S3 cells overexpressing Sirt2. It was investigated whether Sirt2 can delipoylate PDH and regulate its function in living cells. Sirt2 was overexpressed in HeLa S3 cells by transfecting cells with pCMV4a-Sirt2 vector. After transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. Western blot experiments confirmed effective Sirt2 overex- pression. The obtained cell lysates were then subjected to a PDH activity assay. As shown in FIG. 7, PDH activity in cells overexpressing Sirt2 was significantly decreased com- pared to that in wild-type cells. The lipoylation level of DLAT (E2 subunit of PDH) was decreased in cells overex- pressing Sirt2, whereas the total level of DLAT remained unchanged. Furthermore, siRNA knock-down experiments were performed to examine the regulatory effect of endog- enous Sirt2 on the lipoylation of PDH. Effective siRNA- mediated knockdown of Sirt2 was confirmed. Notably, Sirt2 knockdown led to an elevated lipoylation level in DLA. Concomitantly, increased PDH activity was also observed. These results demonstrated that Sirt2 can effectively catal-\n\n[0094] Cu(1)-Catalyzed Cycloaddition/Click Chemistry. 20 uM azide reagent was added to the protein samples labelled by KPlip and KPlip-C.

After that, the digested solution was collected. The gel was further extracted twice using 50% acetonitrile containing 5% formic acid. The combined solu- tion was dried by speed vacuum for LC-MS/MS analysis.\n\n[0091] The present invention provides a panel of chemical probes to investigate the regulatory mechanism of lysine lipoylation. The developed AfBP probe KPlip is capable of capturing Klip-interacting proteins in both living cells and cell lysates. Chemical proteomics experiments with KPlip identified Sirt2 as a novel binder of a lipoylated substrate. KTlip is the first single-step fluorescent probe developed for rapid profiling of delipoylation activity. The enzymology data obtained from both KTlip and lipoylated peptides demonstrated the robust delipoylation ability of Sirt2 in vitro. The delipoylation activity of Sirt2 is far superior to that of Sirt4, the only identified mammalian delipoylating enzyme.\n\n[0097] LC-MS/MS Analysis.\n\nUpon extraction from the gel and desalting, the obtained peptides were redissolved in 12uL of 0.1% formic acid and separated by an Easy-nLC 1200 system coupled to a QEx- active HF (Thermo Scientific).
