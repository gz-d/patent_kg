At its most basic form, the audio processing separates the frequency spectrum into bands corresponding to the number of active electrodes, each handling slightly overlapping frequency ranges. The temporal envelope of the incoming signal in each frequency band is estimated and a train of electrical pulses of corresponding amplitude is delivered to the corresponding electrode in an interleaved sampling.\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE\n\nA portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material, which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.\n\n20\n\nThese methods work effectively for processing speech, owing to our reliance on board spectral \u201cformant\u201d patterns in discriminating human vocalizations. However, such stimulation strategy encodes very little details of harmonic structure cues and temporal fine structure cues for musical pitch and timbre.\n\nDue to technological and user-specific (e.g., biological) limitations, the perception of musical features is diminished in Cls users (individuals with CIs).\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention generally relates to method of processing audio signals and an audio processing system, and more particularly, to methods of processing audio sig- nals and audio processing system for a cochlear implant.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nA cochlear implant (CI) is a surgically implanted neural prosthetic that provides a person with severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss a modified sense of sound to restore functional hearing. CI bypasses the normal ear structure from the external auditory canal, tympanic mem- brane, middle ear, to the cochlear, and replaces it with electric current that directly stimulating the cochlear nerve so that audio signals are directly transmitted to the auditory athways.\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nThe present invention seeks to enable Cl users to person- alize musical features of an audio (music) source so that users can better enjoy the music.\n\nAccording to one aspect of the present invention, a system and method are provided for producing a typically func- tional hearing experience in a hearing-impaired individual. Specifically, in an embodiment of the present invention, the method for processing audio signals includes extracting a fundamental frequency (FO) component from a first audio signal; processing the first audio signal with Dominant Melody Enhancement (DoME) based on a hearing profile and output a second audio signal; and providing the second audio signal to the user. The DoME enhances the FO component. The enhancement weight of the DoME is cor- responding to the hearing profile.\n\nDespite serving as powerful tools to restore functional hearing, modern CIs face significant hurdles in accurately representing complex acoustic signals. In particular, defi- ciencies in the representation of rich harmonic sounds and requency contours prevent Cls from accurately processing elements of acoustic signals which are important for our perception of musical sounds. These deficiencies result from limitations in the two main components of a CI system: the electrode array that is implanted into the cochlea to stimulate the cochlear (auditory) nerve; and the external sound-pro- cessing unit that converts acoustic sounds into electrical signals.\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nAccording to another aspect of the present invention, an audio processing system includes an audio source, a signa output, and a first processor. The first processor electrically connects the audio source and the signal output. The audio source generates a first audio signal, and the first processor extracts a FO component from the first audio signal. The first processor processes the first audio signal with DoME based ona hearing profile and output a second audio signal, and the enhancement weight of the FO component in the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile. The signal output stimulates a cochlear of a user with the second audio signal.\n\nSurgical and clinical factors can further limit the effec- tiveness of the CI in a manner that can vary from patient to patient. These include the depth at which the electrode is placed into the cochlea, possible trauma to the cochlea or auditory nerve before or during the procedure, and other physiological or pathological differences between patients. Auditory nerve stimulation is also limited by the number of electrodes on a given array. In normal hearing (NH) indi- viduals, the auditory nerve is stimulated by thousands of hair cells; in contrast, the most advanced arrays available today can only provide up to 24 electrodes within each cochlea. Furthermore, electrical \u201ccrosstalk\u201d between adjacent elec- trodes on the array limits the number of independent elec- trode channels that can be achieved.\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nAccording to still another aspect of the present invention, an audio processing system includes an audio source, an acoustic device, and a first processor. The first processor electrically connects the audio source and the acoustic device. The audio source generates a first audio signal, and the first processor extracts a FO component from the first audio signal. The first processor processes the first audio signal with DoME based on a hearing profile and output a second audio signal, and the enhancement weight of the FO component in the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile. The acoustic device outputs the second audio signal to a user.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the FO com- ponent is enhanced by adding a frequency-modulated consisting of only the FO component.\n\nCurrent signal processing methods primarily focus on speech intelligibility and have been proven to be successful\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the frequency- modulated sine is added from -21.1 dB to -6.2 dB.\n\nthe\n\nsign\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the frequency- modulated sing is added from -9.6 dB to -4.3 dB below\n\nLUFS.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the FO com- ponent ranges from 212 Hz to 1.4 kHz.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the first audio is mid or up-tempo songs.\n\nsignal\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the first audio signal includes a vocal group and an instrumental group, and processing includes adjusting the weights of the vocal group and the instrumental group.\n\nthe\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the signal output comprises a cochlear implant.\n\nan embodiment of the present invention, the system further includes a first input device.

The auditory stimulus can be played back by one or more loudspeakers, such as consumer headphones or earphones, or used to modify settings (e.g., hardware settings) of a cochlear implant. The above can be used to personalize the auditory stimulus produced by such devices in order to adjust for the unique characteristics of a user\u2019s perception of musical features and the limitations of their cochlear implant.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the system further includes a second input device and a second proces- sor. The second processor is electrically connected the first processor, the audio source and the signal output, and the second input device is electrically connected to the second processor.

In accordance to various embodiments, the audio processing system 10 includes an audio source 100, a signal output 110, and a processor 120. The method inputs audio signal AS1 through the audio source 100, and the audio signal AS1 is processed and provide to a user.\n\n30\n\nThe extracted FO is then mixed with the original music recordings. Moreover, a user may adjust the volume of the FO melody before mixing with the original music recordings until the music sounded most pleasant to the user. The adjusted volume is then saved as one of the parameters of the hearing profile of the audio processing system 10, and the hearing profile of the user of the hearing device (signal output 110) is determined (Step $21). In other words, the hearing profile is made to correspond to the audio source 100, the signal output 110, and the processor 120 of the audio processing system 10, and the method for processing audio signal AS1 (Step $22) may incorporate a user-adjust- able calibration process, allowing each user to configure the music signal processing accordingly to allow for enhance- ment of musical features specific to that person\u2019s prefer- ences and the electrical characteristic of their CI hardware, hearing loss, and the resulting artifacts.\n\nHowever, the hearing profile is not limited to the volume or volume ratio of the dominant melodies of FO melodies. In one embodiment, the hearing profile may also include vol- ume or volume ratio of vocal group or instrumental group in the music recording. To be specific, the audio signal AS1 may further includes a vocal group and an instrumental group, and the processing step of the method also adjusts the weights of enhancement of the vocal group and the instru- mental group. A user may save a preferred volume or volume ratio of vocal group or instrumental group, and with the enhancement of FO component, the user may enjoy the music through audio signal AS2 (Step $23).\n\nThe audio processing system 10 and the method for processing audio signals have a user-specific calibration process that allows users to tailor-adjust musical features to achieve a more pleasurable music listening experience. Also, in some cases, that the calibration does not require repro- gramming of the cochlear implant hardware, which is pri- marily pre-configured for human speech and not readily accessible by the end user.\n\nThe method for processing audio signal AS1 includes: extracting a fundamental frequency (FO) from an audio signal AS1 (Step S1); processing the audio signal AS1 with DoME based on a hearing profile and output an audio signal AS2 (Step S2); and providing the audio signal AS2 to a user 50 (Step S3). During the processing step $2, the DoME enhances the FO component, and the enhancement weight of the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile.\n\nIn one aspect, the system 10 may utilize the method, and the audio source 100 generates the audio signal AS1, and the processor 120 extracts a FO component from the audio signa AS1. The processor 120 processes the audio signal AS1 with DoME based on a hearing profile and output an audio signal AS2. The enhancement weight of the FO component in the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile, and the signal output 110 stimulates a cochlea 51 of a user 50 with the audio signal AS2.\n\nIn this embodiment, the hearing profile comprises settings either enhance/reduce existing features of the audio and/or to synthesize new features based on characteristics source audio and user calibration.\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nTo be specific, the signal output 110 may comprise loudspeaker (e.g., one or more speakers, headphones, ear- phones, headsets, earbuds, etc.), a cochlear implant (elec- tronic device), or a hearing aid (electronic device).\n\nof\n\na\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nTo be specific, the FO component of the audio signal AS1 is enhanced by adding a frequency-modulated sine consist- ing of only the FO component. Moreover, the FO component of the audio signal\u2019s AS1 dominant melody was enhanced by adding a pitch-tracked frequency-modulated sine wave in parallel to the audio signal AS1\n\nIn one embodiment, the frequency-modulated sine is added from -21.1 dB to -6.2 dB, and the effects of the DoME output an audio signal AS2 which is more pleasant to a user.\n\nIn one embodiment, the frequency-modulated sine is added from -9.6 dB to -4.3 dB below -20 LUFS, and the effects of the DoME output an audio signal AS2 which is more pleasant to a user and not having damaging or harmful loudness.\n\nOn the other hand, the frequency of the FO component ranges from 212 Hz to 1.4 kHz. The FO component is within the FO range of the average male and female spoken voice, and within the average melodic range of most targeted musical excerpts.\n\nFIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a method for processing audio signals incorporating loudspeaker playback via headphone/ earphones, designed specifically to address the artifacts caused by CI devices and their effect on users\u2019 music perception.\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\n7\n\n8\n\nThis method incorporates a user-adjustable calibration process, allowing each user to configure the music signal processing accordingly to allow for enhancement of musical features specific to that person\u2019s preferences and the elec- trical characteristic of their CI hardware, hearing loss, and the resulting artifacts. To be specific, the processing may include adjusting or enhancement of the FO component, the vocal group, or the instrumental group.\n\n5\n\nThe input device 130 is electrically connected to the processor 120, and the input device 130 is configured to generate a controlling signal to the processor 120, and the processor 120 adjusts the enhancement weight of the FO component based on the controlling signal from the input device 130 and the hearing profile saved in the audio processing system 10.\n\nThis can be accomplished by offline software processing hosted on consumer devices, a hardware device arranged between the audio source and the playback device, or real-time via acoustic sensors such as microphones. The audio signals in these cases are processed based on user calibration settings to either enhance/reduce existing fea- tures of the audio or to synthesize new features based on characteristics of the source audio.\n\nThe audio processing system 10 and the method\n\ndesigned specifically for cochlear implant users, and the signal processing employed is designed to compensate for the technological limitations of those devices as well as individual differences in music perception. On a signal processing level, this could be accomplished, for example by enhancing the main melody of the music, enhancing the percussive elements (drums, etc.), using source separation algorithms to enhancing only the vocal or only the bass, reducing the complexity of the music through filtering (e.g., frequency filtering), removing the source music entirely and leaving only the enhanced elements, etc. Some of these signal processing techniques may be based on those dis- closed in Cappotto, D., Xuan, W., Meng, Q., Zhang, C., and Schnupp, J.

The above can be used to personalize the auditory stimulus produced by such devices in order to adjust for the unique characteristics of a user\u2019s perception of musical features and the limitations of their cochlear implant.\n\nMoreover, the method for processing audio signals further includes digitally adjusting audio signals AS1 using the determined hearing profile; and converting the digitally adjusted signals to analog signals using a digital-to-analog converter. The adjusting step includes adjusting amplitude, phase, and/or frequency of one or more or all components of the music signals.\n\neferring to FIG. 1, the signal output 110 of the audio processing system 10 includes a cochlear implant.
