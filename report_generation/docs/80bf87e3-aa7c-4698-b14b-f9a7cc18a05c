More particularly, the pres- ent invention is concerned with a method for post-process- ing an electrospinning spinning film to enhance the mechanical properties.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Waterproof and moisture-permeable membrane materials are widely used in the fields of waterproof and moisture-permeable clothing, architectural fabric mem- branes and smart wearables. These materials have a good market prospect and increasing demand. The current water- proof and moisture-permeable membrane materials in a form of fabrics on the market are represented, for example, by expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and its homologous microporous films.\n\n[0003] Commonly used waterproof and moisture-perme- able membrane materials are expanded polyethylene film and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). PTFE by the company Gore-Tex is a porous film prepared by thermal stretching technology. Said film involves many layouts and thus the processing is complex and expensive, such high technology barriers hinder these materials being popularly used.\n\n[0004] Current researches look into using processing methods, other than thermal stretching, such as electrospin- ning to prepare waterproof and moisture-permeable materi- als by assembling layers of a polymer film, which comprises fibers, in particular nanofibers. However, fibers, in particular nanofibers, within each film layer and in different layers have no bonding therebetween, therefore film layers, pre- pared by the electrospun fibers, are easily separated. There- fore, although these materials are waterproof and moisture- permeable but have weak mechanical properties in general.\n\n[0005] The present invention seeks to address such prob- lems, or at least to provide an alternative to the public. It is desirable to provide an electrospun film with bonded struc- ture thus providing high mechanical properties.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0006]\n\nIna\n\nfirst\n\nof the\n\ninvention, it relates\n\naspect present to a method for preparing a polymer film, comprising the following steps: a) preparing a polymer film with a polymer solution prepared from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and/ or thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU); b) preparing a mixed solvent selected from a group consisting of dimethylforma- mide, dimethylacetamide, ethanol, water, or any combina- tion thereof, wherein said mixed solvent is characterized by the solubility of said mixed solvent to the polymer selected for said polymer solution and/or the contact angle of said mixed solvent on said polymer film; c) wetting said polymer film with said mixed solvent; and d) subjecting the wet\n\npolymer film to thermal treatment under pressure.\n\n[0007] In one embodiment, the solubility of said mixed solvent to the polymer selected for said polymer solution is 4.2 wt % to 11.2 wt %.\n\n[0008] In another embodiment, the contact angle of said mixed solvent on said polymer film is 29\u00b0 to 83\u00b0.\n\nJun. 20, 2024\n\n[0009]\n\nAdvantageously, said wet polymer film is subjected\n\nto hot-pressing. Said wetting in step c) can be coating process, in particular dip coating or spin coating.\n\nIn\n\nsaid\n\nfilm\n\n[0010] one embodiment, wet polymer subjected to hot-pressing at 60\u00b0 C. under pressure of 50 to 350 Pa. Preferably, in step 1c), said mixed solvent to said polymer film is in a weight ratio of 0.5. More preferably, in step la), said polymer film is prepared by electrospinning said polymer solution. Advantageously, in step 1c), the fibers in said polymer film are semi-dissolved or partially dis- solved. More advantageously, the fibers semi-dissolved or partially dissolved in step 1c) are linked after said thermal treatment.\n\nis\n\n[0011] In a second aspect of the present invention, relates to a polymer film prepared by the first aspect, characterized in that the breaking strength of said polymer film is increased by at least 150%.\n\nit\n\n[0012] Ina third aspect of the present invention, it relates a polymer film prepared by the first aspect, characterized that the hydrostatic pressure resistance of said polymer film is increased by at least 120%.\n\nto\n\nin\n\n[0013] Ina fourth aspect of the present invention, it relates to a composite which comprises polymer films prepared in the first aspect. The composite is suitable to prepare water- proof and moisture-permeable membrane materials for clothing, architectural fabric membranes and smart wear- ables.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0014] Some embodiments of the present invention will be explained, with reference to the accompanied in which:\u2014\n\nnow\n\nures,\n\nfig-\n\n[0015] FIG. 1 shows a flow chart for preparing an film of the present invention;\n\ntrospun\n\nelec-\n\n[0016] FIG. 2 is an SEM photographic image showing electrospun PVDF film of one embodiment of the present invention before post-processing treatment; Insert in FIG. the magnified view on one area of the SEM photographic in FIG. 2;\n\nis image\n\nan\n\n2\n\n[0017] FIG. 3 is an SEM photographic image showing electrospun PVDF film of one embodiment of the present invention after post-processing treatment; Insert in FIG. 3 the magnified view on one area of the SEM photographic in FIG. 3; and\n\nimage\n\nan\n\nis\n\n[0018] FIG. 4 shows mechanical strength test results two electrospun PVDF films of embodiments of the present invention, in which one is before post-processing and the other one is after post-processing treatment.\n\nof\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0019] This disclosure is now presented by way of examples with reference to the figures in the following paragraphs.

Comparing with the embodiment 17, which uses only water as solvent that is equivalent to no post-processing treatment on the PVDF electrospun film, the breaking strength of the film in embodiment 17 is 9.4 Mpa. It shows that the breaking strength of the films in embodi- ments | to 8 is at least 1.5 times stronger than the untreated PVDF electrospun film in embodiment 17.\n\n[0111] Table 1 above also shows that the breaking strength of the films in embodiments 9 to 16 ranges from 18.1 to 30.4 Mpa, all at least above 18 MPa. Comparing with the embodiment 18, which uses only water as solvent that is equivalent to no post-processing treatment on the TPU electrospun film, the breaking strength of the film in embodi- ment 18 is 12.7 Mpa. It shows that the breaking strength of the films in embodiments 9 to 16 is at least 1.5 times stronger than the untreated TPU electrospun film in embodiment 18.\n\n[0112] FIGS. 2-3 are SEM photographic images showing the effect of post-processing treatment on an electrospun PVDF film according to the present invention, in which FIG. 2 is before post-processing treatment and FIG. 3 is after post-processing treatment. Inserts in FIGS. 2-3 are the magnified view on one area of the SEM photographic images in FIGS. 2-3, respectively. It can be seen that the fibers in FIG. 2 are individual-like and entangled, whereas the fibers in FIG. 3 are linked and disentangled.\n\n[0113] FIG. 4 shows mechanical strength test results two electrospun PVDF films of embodiments of the present invention, in which one is before post-processing and the other one is after post-processing treatment.\n\n[0114] It can be seen from Table 1 above that the moisture permeability of the film in embodiment 17 is 15210 g/m?-d. Moisture permeability of the electrospun films in embodi- ments 1-8 ranges are all substantially the same as that in embodiment 17, indicating the post-processing treatment has no adverse effect after implementing the post-processing treatment on an untreated PVDF electrospun film.\n\n[0115] It can be seen from Table 1 above that the moisture permeability of the film in embodiment 18 is 16280 g/m*-d.

The hydrostatic pressure resistance of the films in embodiments 9 to 16 is at least 1.2 times higher than the untreated TPU electrospun film in embodi- ment 18.\n\n[0117] Post-processing treatment according to the present invention provides a novel and inventive means to semi- dissolve or partially dissolve nanofibers in the electrospun film, with controllable manner, by selected solvent, such that during the drying process, for example in step 3b) in the general steps described foregoing, the semi-dissolved or partially dissolved nanofibers physically contacts with each other, in particular in-situ bonded or linked to each other, and thus forming a contact point between each other, as shown in FIG. 3, and eventually forming a robust bonded- structure. Experiment results show that before post-process- ing treatment, nanofibers slide under tensile strain, however after post-processing treatment, since nanofibers are linked to form a bonded structure, sliding between nanofibers is restricted and therefore the broken strain in embodiments 1-16 is enhanced. Post-processing treatment provides physi- cal bonding between the electrospun film fibers, enabling an electrospun three-dimensional network structure with strengthening points (the contact points between nanofibers) is constructed, realizing electrospun film prepared according to the present invention with high strength. The obtained electrospun film has better mechanical properties, moisture permeability and hydrostatic pressure resistance. Mean- while, the preparation according to the present invention is\n\nstreamlined, simple, and viable to be industrialized.\n\n[0118] The description of the above embodiments is only used to help understanding the method and core idea of the present invention.
