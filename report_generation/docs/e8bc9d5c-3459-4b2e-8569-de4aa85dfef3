The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears ln the Patent and Trademark Ofhce patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0002] The present invention generally relates to a metal- carbon composite of a core-shell structure and a method of synthesizing the same.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0003] Gold (Au) nanoparticles, as catalysis and surface- enhanced Raman scattering-active plasmonic substrates, have been extensively investigated within the last 40 years. Freestanding gold (Au) nanosheets with a nanoscale thick- ness, also termed as 2D Au in the literature of 2D metals, have attracted considerable research interest for their appli- cations In catalysis, photoelectronics, and biomedicine. As a result of the high surface-to-volume ratio, Au nanosheets contain much more low-coordinated surface atoms than their bulk counterparts. Consequently, the active sites offered by Au nanosheets are abundant in various electrochemical reactions, which can lead to exceptionally high catalytic activities in CO oxidation or selective oxidation of C\u2014H bonds. Meanwhile, the high surface-to-volume ratio also endows Au nanosheets with unique shape-dependent optical properties due to the collective oscillations of conduction electrons on their surface, a phenomenon known as \u201csurface plasmon resonance\u201d, which can result in high absorptions that can be extended to the near-infrared (NIR) region and hence suitable for applications in biomedical diagnostics and biosensors.\n\n[0004] However, in theory, metallic nanosheets with excessive surface atoms are thermodynamically unfavor- able, which can reduce their free energy by minimizing their surface area. Consequently, the properties of Au nanosheets can be readily \u201cdegraded\u201d after thermal heating or irradia- tion by electron beams.\n\n[0005] It was discovered that thermal stability of metallic nanostructures, such as OD nanoparticles and 1D nanorods, could be enhanced via encapsulation with an appropriate \u201cshell\u201d material, such as carbon, silica, and metal oxide. The presence of the shell can hinder the diffusion of surface atoms even at elevated temperatures, therefore isolating the \u201ccore\u201d material for protection. However, fabrication of encapsulated nanoparticles was not straightforward, which usually involved multi-step chemical reactions following physical deposition or electron beam irradiation.\n\n[0006] \u2018Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide an easy and scalable method to fabricate metal nanoparticles encapsulated with a protection layer.\n\nMar. 2, 2023\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\na\n\n[0007] One objective of the present invention is to provide simple yet efficient method for the scalable production crystalline gold (Au) nanoparticles encapsulated by amor- phous carbon.\n\nof\n\n[0008] In accordance to one aspect of the present inven- tion, the present invention provides a method for synthesiz- ing a metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure.

The annealing time is in a range of 30 to 600 minutes, and the annealing temperature is in a range of 300 to 900\u00b0 C.\n\n[0023] A second aspect of the present invention provides a metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure, where a metal nanoparticle constitutes a core and an amorphous carbon-containing phase having a thickness of approxi- mately 2 nm or less constitutes a shell, and the shell surrounds a portion or the entirety of the core.\n\na\n\n[0024] A third aspect of the present invention provides substrate selected from a porous metal grid, a (porous) ceramic plate, a silicon substrate, a fused silica substrate glass substrate having a uniform dispersion of the metal- carbon composite formed thereon.\n\n[0025] In accordance to one embodiment, the size distri- bution of the metal-carbon composite of a core-shell struc- ture is in a range of 20 to 800 nm.\n\n[0026] Compared to the traditional methods for the syn- thesis and deployment of nanoparticles, the metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure made by the present method have the following advantages:\n\n[0027] (1) the present method allows deploying nan- oparticles on various materials regardless of their sur- face topologies (e.g., planar, rough, or porous surfaces), which are attractive for the surface modification of complex-shaped materials and structures, such as elec- trodes in energy related applications and biosensors in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering;\n\n[0028] (2) the size of the metal-carbon core-shell nan- oparticles is from tens to hundreds of nanometers, which can be easily adjusted by altering the sheet thickness, annealing temperature and time.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifica- tions, including additions and/or substitutions may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Specific details may be omitted so as not to obscure the invention; however, the disclosure is written to enable one skilled in the art to practice the teachings herein without undue experimentation.\n\n[0058] The present method allows for the synthesis of amorphous carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles with a controlled size. An exemplary core-shell nanoparticle formed according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 3C. A thin shell of approximately 2 nm includes amorphous carbon and surround a metal core of approximately 25-60 nm. In the method described below freestanding nanosheets can be easily transferred to various planar or non-planar substrates, which facilitate the fabrication of complex- shaped electrode and biosensor materials by decomposing the polymer portions of nanosheets for surface modification, forming core-shell structures.\n\nthe\n\nnanosheet\n\nmetal\n\ninventive method,\n\n[0059]\n\nIn\n\na\n\nformed on polymer-covered glass substrate. The metal nanosheet is delaminated from the polymer-covered glass substrate through immersion in a fluid. The delaminated nanosheet 1s transferred onto a second target substrate that includes a polymer precursor for the shell layer. The organic- metal nanosheet are heated to decompose the organic mate- rial to form an amorphous carbon-containing shell that surrounds the metal nanocore. The amorphous-carbon-con- taining shell is approximately 2 nm thick or less on a core having an average size of approximately 42 nm Turning to FIG. 1A, a method is depicted in detail for synthesizing a metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure. In FIG. 1, the method is for the production of crystalline gold nan- oparticles encapsulated by amorphous carbon; however, other encapsulated metal nanoparticles may be formed using\n\nthe same technique.\n\n[0060] Step I\u2014PVA solution was spin coated on a glass substrate until it can fully and uniformly cover the surface of the glass substrate to form a PVA-covered glass substrate;\n\n[0061] Step I]\u2014the prepared PVA-covered glass substrate dehydrated in a drying oven at 80\u00b0 C. for 1 hour and air-cooled to room temperature;\n\nwas\n\n[0062] Step IT \u4e00 a gold film was then deposited onto the PVA-covered glass substrate through a variety of physical vapor deposition methods (e.g., magnetron sputtering, elec- tron beam and ion-beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, etc.) to fabricate a PVA-gold film. The gold film is deposited to a thickness of approximately 10-60 nm During the deposition, the temperature on the substrate should be kept less than 100\u00b0 C. to avoid the degradation of PVA substrate;\n\n[0063] Step Tv \u4e00 the substrate with PVA-gold film was immersed into deionized water at room temperature for 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of metal film. Due to polymer surface buckling-induced exfoliation, organic- gold nanosheets can delaminate from the substrate sponta- neously and form 2D freestanding organic-gold nanosheet. That is, a portion of the PVA substrate accompanies the gold nanosheet to form the composite organic-gold nanosheet. As will be discussed in further detail below deposition of Au onto PVA can lead to the formation of a subsurface Au-\n\nis\n\nMar. 2, 2023\n\norganic layer and even partial carbonization of the PVA. After delamination, the deionized water was replaced remove the dissolved PVA;\n\nto\n\n[0064] Step V\u2014the organic-gold nanosheets was then transferred onto a target substrate and put into a muffle furnace. The substrate is expected to include, but not limit to, planar silicon, glass, sapphire substrate, and non-planar anodized alumina oxide (AAQ) plate; and\n\n[0065] Step V \u4e00 the target substrate with the organic-gold nanosheets was placed onto a glass tube and annealed with a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C./min in the air and cooled down with the muffle furnace (L 3/11 type, Nabertherm) to fabricate the gold-amorphous carbon composite as a core-shell structure. The target temperature and time depend on the thickness of nanosheets, such as at 350\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes for thick- ness=20 nm.\n\n[0066] Inone embodiment, the PVA solution was prepared adding commercial PVA powder (purchased from Shan- dong Usolf Chemical Technology with the grade of 0588) into deionized water, and the PVA hydrogel has a mass fraction of 5-15%.\n\nby\n\n[0067] In one embodiment, when preparing the 2D free- standing organic-metal nanosheets, the structure of the organic layer in the exfoliated organic-metal sheets is dif- ferent from the pristine PVA polymer, which assists is preparing the core-shell nanoparticles. This 1s particularly true for high-energy deposition processes such as sputtering as the energy of the metal particle impacting the polymer can cause structural changes and partial carbonization.\n\n[0068] In one embodiment, the water flowing was kept gently during delamination to maintain the integrity of nanosheets. Further, in order to speed up delamination, film can be cut into some small rectangles, or the deionized water can be heated to 40-50\u00b0 C.\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\n[0069] In one embodiment, FIG. 2A shows a photograph of a PVA-gold film on glass substrate, and FIG. 2B shows a photograph of the 2D freestanding organic-gold nanosheets floating on surface of the deionized water, which appears half-opaque and greenish. According to the AFM height image, the collected organic-gold nanosheets transferred onto a silicon substrate has a uniform thickness of approxi- mately 20 nm (FIG. 2C). Subsequently, corresponding selected-area electron diffraction of the 20 nm-thick organic- gold nanosheets was also conducted by TEM, as shown in FIG. 2D. FIG. 2E is the FTIR pattern, showing the presence of broken PVA molecular structures.\n\n[0070] In one embodiment, FIGS. 3A and 3B show a 20 nm-thick organic-gold nanosheet on the 1 cmxl cm silicon substrate before and after annealing, respectively. The annealing conditions are at 350\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. After annealing, the as-fabricated FCC gold-amorphous carbon core-shell nanoparticles were observed by using a transmis- sion electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in FIGS. 3C to 3E. In the TEM images, it clearly reveals that the amorphous surface layer has a lattice spacing value of approximately 2 nm, and the FCC gold core has a lattice spacing value of 0.227 nm.\n\n[0071] Compared to the traditional methods for the syn- thesis and deployment of nanoparticles, the present nanosheet-based fabrication method is flexible and highly efficient. The freestanding nanosheets can be easily trans- ferred onto various substrates regardless of their morphol- ogy and roughness. The thickness of the metal film can be adjusted in accordance with the deposition time. The size\n\nUS 2023/0064413 Al\n\nand distribution of the prepared gold-amorphous carbon core-shell nanoparticles can be tuned by varying annealing time and temperature, the thickness of nanosheets and the type of substrate.\n\n[0072] In addition, the method can further be extended form other noble metal-carbon core-shell nanoparticles. For example, the noble metal can be ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Qs), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), gold (Au), and silver (Ag).\n\n[0073] Referring to FIGS. 4A, 4C, 4E, the 20 nm-thick organic-gold nanosheets on the silicon substrates were annealed according to different annealing conditions, such as at 450\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, at 600\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, or at 300\u00b0 C. for 120 minutes. The results show that the as-fabricated nanoparticles have a different size distribution, the quantification results were shown in FIGS. 4B (0-500 nm), 4D (100-400 nm) and 4F (0-400 nm).\n\n[0074] Referring to FIGS. 5A and 5C, different thickness G.e. 11 nm or 80 nm) organic-gold nanosheets on the sapphire substrates were annealed according to the same annealing conditions of 600\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. FIG. 5B shows that the thinner (11 nm) nanosheets on the sapphire substrate have a particle size of approximately 10-70 nm, and FIG. 5D shows that the thicker (80 nm) nanosheets on the sapphire substrate have a particle size of approximately 100-1200 nm.\n\n[0075] Moreover, the freestanding nanosheets can also be transferred onto non-planar substrates. For example, FIGS. 6A and 6B show the case when 20 nm-thick organic-gold nanosheets on non-planar substrates, such as Mo grid or AAO plate. Both organic-gold nanosheets were annealed according to the same annealing conditions of 600\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes.\n\nTo further understand the formation of\n\n[0076] nanopar- ticles, isothermal annealing was performed on the gold- carbon nanosheets (thickness=25 nm) at a variety of tem- peratures ranging from 300-800\u00b0 C. As shown in FIG. 7, it can be seen that the nanosheet broke up into tiny fragments after annealing at 300\u00b0 C. or 500\u00b0 C. for 2 hours, and was subsequently transformed into nanoparticles after annealing for 10 hours. The general trend is that the longer is the annealing time, the larger is the formed nanoparticle. In the present invention, it also noted that the particle size grew at the expense of their number density ((e), (f) in the FIG. 7), which is similar to a typical Ostwald ripening process. Based on the above results, it is clear that the formation of the nanoparticles is thermodynamically favored after the Au\u2014C\n\nnanosheet is decomposed upon heating.\n\n[0077] Referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B, a glassy carbon electrode coated with metal-carbon nanoparticles 1s pro- vided by isothermal annealing of organic-gold membranes. FIG. 8A shows a photography of the glassy carbon electrode coated with organic-gold membrane and metal-carbon com- posite nanoparticles, and its optical microscope image 1s shown in FIG. 8B.\n\nExamples\n\n[0078] The examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are included within the spirit and purview of this application. In addition, any elements or limitations of any invention or embodiment thereof dis- closed herein can be combined with any and/or all other\n\nto\n\nMar. 2, 2023\n\nelements or limitations (individually or in any combination) any other invention or embodiment thereof disclosed herein, and all such combinations are contemplated with scope of the invention without limitation thereto.\n\nor\n\nthe\n\n[0079] Fabrication of Metal-Carbon Composite Via Poly- Surface Buckling-Enabled Exfoliation (PSBEE):\n\nmer\n\n[0080]\n\nFirst,\n\na polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel layer\n\nwas spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 30 seconds on a square or a circular glass plate with the lateral size of 100 mm Subsequently, the PVA-covered glass substrate was placed in a drying oven for dehydration at 80\u00b0 C. for 1 hour and air-cooled to room temperature. After that, a gold film was deposited onto the PVA-covered glass substrate via ion beam sputtering at the working pressure of 0.1 Pa and ion beam current of 10 mA. The thickness of the deposited gold film was controlled by varying the deposition time. The deposition of Au onto PVA can lead to the formation of a subsurface Au-organic layer and even partial carbonization of PVA. The subsequent interfacial fracture further faclll- tates chemical bond breakage and carbonization, eventually leading to the formation of the freestanding carbon-contain- ing gold nanosheet. The presence of amorphous carbon is\n\nevident even before exfoliation.\n\n[0081] Finally, the Au-PVA-glass system was immersed water for few minutes. After that, freestanding nanosheets spontaneously delaminated from the PVA. The resulting nanosheets contained two phases, 1.e., the Au-rich FCC phase and carbon-rich amorphous phase.\n\nln\n\n[0082] By using the PSBEE, it is able to synthesize freestanding ultrathin carbon-containing metal (hereafter referred to as metal-C) nanosheets, which may have a centimeter in-plane size and thickness down to approxi- mately 10 nm.\n\n[0083] Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC):\n\n[0084]\n\nThermal analysis\n\nwas\n\nperformed\n\non\n\nthe\n\nmetal-\n\ncarbon composite via a flash differential scanning calonim- etry (DSC) (Flash-DSC 2, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland). First, the metal-carbon nanosheets were collected in a small plastic tube with DI water. After drying for 8 hours at 60\u00b0 C., the nanosheets were transferred to glass slides or sapphire substrates for later use. The flash DSC specimens were prepared using the nanosheets, which were transferred from the glass slides or sapphire substrates onto temperature- corrected sensors (MultiSTAR UFS1, Mettler-Toledo, Swit- zerland) under a stereo microscope. During flash DSC, silicone oil was applied on the chip surface to facilitate heat transfer between the nanosheets and the chip. To further study the thermal stability of the nanosheets, the nanosheets were also heated on the sapphire substrates in the Netzsch DSC system in an argon (Ar) environment at a heating rate\n\nof 1\u00b0 C//s.\n\n[0085] Scalable Production of Metal-Carbon Composite: [0086] The metal-carbon nanosheets were transferred to the sapphire substrates. After that, the metal-carbon nanosheets were dried and heated up in a muffle furnace to a target temperature between 300-800\u00b0 C. at a rate of 10\u00b0 C./min. Isothermal annealing was then performed for 0.5-10 hours in air to produce metal-carbon nanoparticles.\n\n[0087] Structural and Property Characterizations of Metal- Carbon Composite and Nanoparticles\n\n[0088] Structural characterization was carried out for metal-carbon composite and nanoparticles by using scan- ning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI-Versa 3D Dual Beam) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS),\n\nthe\n\nUS 2023/0064413 Al\n\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai F20), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (MFP-3D Origin, Oxford Instruments). The surface morphology and thickness of the metal-carbon composite were examined with AFM at a noncontact mode. The Raman spectra were obtained using the Renishaw inVia Raman microscope excited with a laser of a wavelength of 532 nm. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were measured using the Nicolet IN10 MX infrared imaging microscope.\n\nDefinitions\n\n[0089] Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d or variations such as \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccomprising\u2019\u2019, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
