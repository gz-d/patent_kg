Power adaptors (or AC-DC power converters) are traditionally used to charge the batteries in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic prod- ucts, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable electronic equipment.\n\nRecently, a number of types of planar inductive charging platforms have been proposed. One example is described in GB2399225A which generates an AC electromagnetic flux 1 with the flux lines flowing \u201chorizontally\u201d along the charging surface 2 as shown in FIG. 1A. A distributed winding is used in this charging platform for generating the AC flux. This principle is in fact similar to the AC electromagnetic flux generated in a cylindrical motor, except that the cylindrical structure is compressed into a flat pancake shape. As the flux needs to flow horizontally along the upper and lower surfaces, two inherent limitations arise.\n\nFirstly, an electromagnetic flux guide must be used to guide the fiux along the bottom surface. This is usually a layer of soft magnetic material such as ferrite or amorphous alloy. In order to provide sufficient flux, this layer must be \u201cthick\u201d enough so that the flux can flow along the layer of soft mag- netic material without magnetic saturation. Secondly, a simi- jar problem applies to the secondary device that has to pick up to flux (and energy) on the upper surface of the charging platform.\n\nshown in FIG. 3, ithas been shown that both energy and signal can be transferred from one planar winding to another. This planar PCB transformer technology has been applied in a range of applications. In 2004, it was used by for a contactless battery charger for mobile phone in Choi B., Nho J., Cha H. and Choi S., \u201cDesign and implementation of low-profile con- tactless battery charger using planar printed circuit board windings as energy transfer device,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 51, No. 1, February 2004, pp. 140-147. Choi et al uses one planar winding as a primary charging pad and a separate planar winding as a secondary winding as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIG. 5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit diagram of this contactless charg- ing system. As explained in Choi et al, the circuit operation of the coreless PCB transformer is based on the theory proposed by Hui etal. It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described in Hui et al, while the front power stage of the secondary circuit is a standard winding witha diode rectifier that provides the rectified DC voltage for\n\nFIG. 1B shows the device required for the charging plat- orm of FIG. 1A. This consists of a magnetic core 3 and a winding. In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area (shaded in FIG. 1B). Therefore, this cross-sectional area must be large enough so that enough flux and energy can be picked up by the second- ary device. It should be noted that this secondary device must be housed inside the electronic equipment to be charged on the charging platform. The thickness of the secondary device is crucial to the applicability and practicality of the device. If it is too thick, it simply cannot be housed in the electronic equipment.\n\nTwo main problems suffered by the charging system of FIG. 5 proposed by Choi et al include: (1) The planar winding\n\nAnother type of planar inductive battery charging platform is described in GB2389720A.

In practice, a secondary module (or energy receiving element) is used to pick up the energy for charging the load. FIG. 7 shows that in one practical experimental setup, the rectified DC voltage picked up by a secondary module on the planar surface is not entirely uniform over the planar surface and in particular is reduced in the central part of the planar surface.

In many cases this will imply that the second winding is located concentrically with respect to the first winding, though other positions may be necessary depending on the shape of the first winding and the resulting flux pattern.\n\nFIG. 8A shows a schematic of a planar inductive charging platform based on a single planar primary winding 7 that surrounds a charging surface.

The additional voltage (Curve Y) due to the magnetic flux generated by the auxiliary winding in the cen- tral region compensates for the central voltage sag phenom- enon in the planar charging platform. FIG. 10 shows a prac- tical example of a charging platform with such an auxiliary winding excited in the same way as the first primary coil. It can be seen that the voltage sag is greatly reduced.
