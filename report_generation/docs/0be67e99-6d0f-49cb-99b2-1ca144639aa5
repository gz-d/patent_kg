The first substrate layer is arranged between the dielectric resonator element and the second substrate layer. The substrate assembly may include additional layers attached to the first and second substrate layers.\n\nDIELECTRIC RESONATOR ANTENNA\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n[0001] The invention relates to a dielectric resonator antenna, in particular, a dielectric resonator antenna that can provide different linearly-polarized omnidirectional radia- tion patterns.\n\n[0012] The first substrate layer and the second substrate layer may have the same cross section, thickness, or size. first substrate layer and the second substrate layer may have the same dielectric constant.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] In field of telecommunications, the use of antennas (single or multiple) to transmit/receive/transceive signals known as antenna diversity. Antenna diversity can improve wireless communication links by mitigating multipath effect deep fading effect, and improving channel capacity.\n\n[0013] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the feeding network is arranged between the first substrate layer and dielectric resonator element.\n\n[0014] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the substrate assembly further includes a ground plane arranged between. the first and second substrate layers and being operably connected with the feeding network.\n\n[0003] Various types of antenna diversity have been pro- posed. Examples of these include spatial diversity and polarization diversity.\n\n[0015] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the substrate assembly further includes a microstrip line network arranged on the second substrate layer on a side opposite the ground plane. The microstrip line network is operably connected. with the feeding network.\n\n[0004] In spatial diversity, multiple antennas, usually of the same characteristics, are separated by a certain distance that is preferably commensurate with the wavelength. The antennas can use the same operation mode. This arrange- ment, while useful is some applications, is rather bulky and suffers from high correlation and high cost.\n\n[0016] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the substrate assembly further includes a feed probe extending through first and second substrate layers, the feed probe arranged to operably connect the feeding network with microstrip line network.\n\n[0005] In polarization diversity, a dual-polarized antenna with different polarizations of is generally used, and the signals are processed independently. This arrangement offers potential for diversity combining, and can mitigate polarization mismatches that would otherwise cause signal fade.\n\n[0017] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the feed network includes a first network portion arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element to produce the first linearly- polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern, and a second. network portion arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element to produce the second linearly-polarized omnidi- rectional radiation pattern\n\n[0006] There is a need to provide an improved or alter- native antenna that can be used for (but not limited to) polarization diversity.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0018] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first network portion includes a patch operably connected with the ground plane and the conductive microstrip line net- work. The patch may be arranged centrally of the substrate assembly. The microstrip line network may include a first microstrip line for connection with a first probe or connector, and the patch is operably connected with the ground plane and with the first microstrip line.\n\nthere is provided a dielectric resonator antenna having a dielectric resonator element and a substrate assembly attached to the dielectric resonator element. The substrate assembly comprising a feeding network arranged to: feed the dielectric resonator element to produce (or receive) a first linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern at a first resonant mode; and feed the dielectric resonator ele- ment to produce (or receive) a second linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern at a second resonant mode different from the first resonant mode. The antenna can be used as a signal transmitter, a signal receiver, or a signal transceiver. The substrate assembly may be removably attached to the dielectric resonator element. Preferably, the\n\n[0019] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch is connected with the first microstrip line through the feed probe. The feed probe may be connected to a center of the patch. In one example, the patch includes a central circular portion and a plurality of radially extending portions extend- ing from the central circular portion. In one example, the number of radially extending portions is an even number. Each of the plurality of radially extending portions may be connected to the ground plane through a respective via that extends through the first substrate layer. Preferably, the radially extending portions are angularly spaced apart\n\n[0008] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first resonant mode is TM mode. In one example, the first resonant mode is TM,,, mode. The first resonant mode may alternatively be TE mode, monopole antenna mode, or loop antenna mode.\n\n[0020] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the second network portion includes a plurality of arc-shaped patches arranged on a circular trajectory. The plurality of arc-shaped patches is operably connected with the ground plane and the microstrip line network. The microstrip line network may include a power combining-dividing network and a second microstrip line for connection with a second probe.\n\n[0009] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the second resonant mode is TE mode. In one example, the second resonant mode is TE,,,,, mode. The second resonant mode may alternatively be TM mode, monopole antenna mode, or loop antenna mode.\n\n[0010] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first resonant mode is TM mode (e.g., TM,,3 mode) and the second resonant mode is TE mode (e.g., TE,,5,, mode). Other antenna modes are also possible.\n\n[0021] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the power combining-dividing network comprises a plurality of each corresponding to a respective arc-shaped\n\nis\n\nand\n\n[0007]\n\nIn accordance with a first aspect of the invention,\n\nantenna is a polarization diversity antenna.\n\nThe\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nis the\n\nevenly.\n\nsec- patch\n\ntions\n\nUS 2021/0066816 A1\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\n2\n\nand a combining section connecting the plurality of sections .\n\nwith the substrate assembly of FIG . 2A when connected at\n\nEach of the plurality of sections and the respective arc\n\na first port ( TE port ) with a signal source ;\n\nshaped patch may be connected through a respective via\n\n[ 0037 ] FIG . 4B is a graph showing a second radiation\n\npattern ( E - plane and H - plane , measured and simulated , at\n\n( i.e. , via hole ) that extends through the first and second\n\nsubstrate layers .

FIG. 4 compares the measured and simulated radia- tion patterns at 2.44 GHz. With reference to FIG. 4A, an omnidirectional radiation pattern can be observed for the TE port. In both of the E- and H-planes, the co-polar fields are higher than the cross-polar fields by at least 15 dB, which is acceptable for practical applications. For the TM port, omnidirectional radiation pattern can also be seen in FIG. 4B. As shown in FIG. 4B, a 15-dB difference between the co-polar and cross-polar fields can be observed in the E-plane. However, the measured cross-polarization gets larger in the H-plane. This is likely due to the measurement problem, and it is envisaged that this problem can be solved. ameliorated balun.\n\n[0050] The measured and simulated realized gains of the prototype are shown in FIG. 5.
