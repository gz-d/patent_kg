However, some negative\n\ntheir unique properties. However, for prolonged use in a\n\neffects have also been pointed out. For example, Berger\n\nhuman body, deterioration of the corrosion resistance of the\n\nGorbet et al. have found that the osteogenesis process and\n\nmaterials becomes a critical issue, because of the possibility\n\nosteonectin synthesis activity in NiTi alloys are unfavorable\n\nof deleterious ions released from the substrate to living tis\n\ncompared to stainless steels and titanium alloys.' Jia et al. in\n\nSues. Therefore, we suggested the use of plasma immersion\n\n25\n\nion implantation and deposition and related ion-beam and\n\ntheir study revealed that the cell death rate was severe on NiTi\n\nalloys.\n\nplasma-based techniques to implant some other elements,\n\nThese problems are believed to stem from the poor corro\n\nsuch as CH, N, and O, into NiTi substrates to alter corro\n\nsion resistance and wear properties of the alloys. We have\n\nsion resistance of the materials, which may lead to an increase\n\nin their cytotoxicity. It is most likely that some toxic compo\n\nSuccessfully demonstrated that the corrosion resistance and\n\n30\n\nwear properties of nickel titanium shape memory alloys can\n\nnents released from the substrate cause the cell death rather\n\nthan the apoptosis. Shih et al. reported that the supernatant\n\nbe enhanced by implanting nitrogen, carbon and oxygen onto\n\nthe substrate surface. Additionally, with the use of plasma\n\nand corrosive products from NiTi may result in the death of\n\nimmersion ion implantation or deposition, the biological\n\nSmooth muscle cells, especially when the amount of released\n\nnickel is higher than 9 ppm.

While\n\nAccording to one preferred embodiment, the invention\n\nprovides a method for the altering Surface composition of a\n\nthe homogeneity of the materials microstructures and the\n\nSurface morphology may alter the anti-corrosion ability of\n\nnickel titanium alloy part to increase biocompatibility, com\n\nprising implanting nitrogen, oxygen or carbon on the Surface\n\nNiTi alloys, there is no doubt that the corrosion resistance and\n\n40\n\nanti-wear properties of the materials must be enhanced before\n\nof the nickel titanium alloy part by plasma immersion ion\n\nthe materials can be widely used clinically, especially as\n\nimplantation, or deposition, or ion beam immersion or\n\northopedic implants with couplings where fretting is\n\nimplantation. The nickel titanium alloy is preferably a shape\n\nexpected.\n\nmemory alloy, and has a nickel content ranging from about\n\nTitanium carbides and nitrides have excellent mechanical\n\n20-80% of nickel and 80-20% of titanium.

(A) NiTi alloy without surface treatment, (B) with nitrogen PII implantation, (C) with acetylene PIII implantation, and (D) with oxygen PIII implantation.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nShape memory materials such as nickel titanium (NiTi) alloys are promising materials for surgical implants in ortho- pedics due to their unique shape memory effect (SME) and super-elasticity (SE) that other common orthopedic materials such as stainless steels and titanium alloys do not possess. Their mechanical properties are also closer to that of cortical bones than stainless steels and titanium alloys. The materials display superior wear resistance to CoCrMo alloys used in bone trauma fixation. Several other favorable properties of the materials have also been investigated, and good bio-com- patibility has also been reported. However, some negative effects have also been pointed out. For example, Berger- Gorbet et al. have found that the osteogenesis process and osteonectin synthesis activity in NiTi alloys are unfavorable compared to stainless steels and titanium alloys.\u2019 Jia et al. in their study revealed that the cell death rate was severe on NiTi alloys.\u201d\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION,\n\nShape memory materials such as nickel titanium alloys (NiTi) are useful materials in biomedical applications due to their unique properties. However, for prolonged use in a human body, deterioration of the corrosion resistance of the materials becomes a critical issue, because of the possibility of deleterious ions released from the substrate to living tis- sues. Therefore, we suggested the use of plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition and related ion-beam and lasma-based techniques to implant some other elements, such as C,H,, N,, and O,, into NiTi substrates to alter corro- sion resistance and wear properties of the alloys. We have successfully demonstrated that the corrosion resistance and wear properties of nickel titanium shape memory alloys can be enhanced by implanting nitrogen, carbon and oxygen onto the substrate surface. Additionally, with the use of plasma immersion ion implantation or deposition, the biological roperties such as osteoconductivity and hydrophilicity can also be reduced or enhanced.\n\nThese problems are believed to stem from the poor corro- sion resistance of the materials, which may lead to an increase in their cytotoxicity. It is most likely that some toxic compo- nents released from the substrate cause the cell death rather than the apoptosis.* Shih et al. reported that the supernatant and corrosive products from NiTi may result in the death of smooth muscle cells, especially when the amount of released nickel is higher than 9 ppm.* A few other studies have also reported that nickel ionss leached from the alloys cause allergic reactions in nickel hyper-sensitive patients.\u201d1\u00b0 While the homogeneity of the materials microstructures and the surface morphology may alter the anti-corrosion ability of NiTi alloys, there is no doubt that the corrosion resistance and anti-wear properties of the materials must be enhanced before the materials can be widely used clinically, especially as orthopedic implants with couplings where fretting is expected.\n\nAccording to one preferred embodiment, the invention rovides a method for the altering surface composition of a nickel titanium alloy part to increase biocompatibility, com- rising implanting nitrogen, oxygen or carbon on the surface of the nickel titanium alloy part by plasma immersion ion implantation, or deposition, or ion beam immersion or implantation. The nickel titanium alloy is preferably a shape memory alloy, and has a nickel content ranging from about 20-80% of nickel and 80-20% of titanium. The surface implantation of elements enhances the mechanical properties of the alloy, such as hydrophilicity, corrosion and wear resis- tance. The nickel titanium alloy part can be reduced or enhanced. In practicing the invention, the plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition or related ion-beam and plasma-based techniques such as plasma-enhanced vapor phase deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (VPD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can reduce, terminate or prevent the deleterious ions from being released from the substrate of the shape memory materials. The mate- rials may be biomaterials used for orthopedics, urologics, vascular surgery, hepatobiliary surgery or esophageal sur- gery. The energy of the incident species used for surface treatment of the materials ranges from 1 eV to 1 keV for deposition, 500 eV to 100 keV for implantation and deposi- tion, and 500 eV to 10 MeV for beam-line ion implantation. Preferably, the energy of the surface treatment of the materi- als ranges from 1 eV to 500 eVs for deposition, 500 eVs to 1000 eVs for implantation and deposition, and 1000 to 1000 MeVs for beamline ion implantation. The direct current is applied with the parameters 0 Hz repetition with \u2018infinite\u2019\n\n\u2018Titanium carbides and nitrides have excellent mechanical and chemical properties, for example, good wear resistance, inactive with numbers of chemical substances and outstand- ing hardness [11-16]. Titanium oxides are known to be fairy compatible with living tissues [17-20]. They are also inactive to many chemical reactions. In surface coating industries, these elements have been applied to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties of the substrates through various methods [21-25] for a period of time.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention provides a method for the altering surface composition of a nickel titanium alloy part to increase bio- compatibility, comprising implanting nitrogen, oxygen or carbon on the surface of the nickel titanium alloy part by plasma immersion ion implantation, or deposition, or ion beam immersion or implantation. The surface may also be altered by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition or related ion-beam and plasma-based techniques such as plasma-enhanced vapor phase deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (VPD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).\n\nUSS. which\n\nof\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nand\n\npulse duration to 5000 Hz.
