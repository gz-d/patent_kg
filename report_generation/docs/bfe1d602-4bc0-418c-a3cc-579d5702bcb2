The electron beam is typically gener- ated by an electron gun in the microscope. The focus of the electron beam is then modified by an electromagnetic \u201clens system\u201d. A deflector, in the form of coil(s), is energized (adjustable) to move the electron beam in first and second scanning directions in the same plane for scanning the specimen. The orthogonal degree between the two scanning directions or lines, generally referred to as orthogonality, is an important parameter that determines the quality of the image produced. In operation, orthogonality should be con- trolled such that the two scanning directions or lines can be regarded as being orthogonal to each other (as close to 90 degrees as possible) in order to minimize image distortion. The manufacture tolerance and assembly error of the deflec- tor may complicate the achievement of this object.\n\n[0009] In this first aspect, the predetermined equations may include\n\nA=A-B'sin \u4e2d\n\nB=Breos >\n\nwhere A\u2019 is a detected amplitude of a drive signal in the first scanning direction, B' is a detected amplitude of a drive signal in the second scanning direction, A is a required amplitude of a drive signal in the first reference scanning direction, B is a required amplitude of a drive signal in the second reference scanning direction, \u4e2d is a deviation angle between the second scanning direction and the second reference scanning direction. The control signal is arranged to control the deflector based on A and B.\n\n[0010] In this first aspect, the predetermined equations may include\n\nA=A-Besin \u7531\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nB-B'\n\nthere is provided a control unit for controlling a deflector in an imaging apparatus. The imaging apparatus has an elec- tron gun arranged to provide electron beam to scan a specimen, and the deflector.

The microscope 100 may provide a vacuum environ- ment in which the components of the microscope 100 are arranged. The microscope 100 includes an electron gun 102 arranged to generate an electron stream. A set of condenser lens 104 (e.g., formed by electromagnetic coils) is arranged to control the focus the electron steam, and a set of electron lens 106 (e.g., formed by electromagnetic coils) downstream of the condenser lens 104 is arranged to further adjust the focus on the electron stream to focus the electron beam on the specimen X placed on a platform 108. A deflector 120 (e.g., formed by electromagnetic coils) may be arranged between the condenser lens 104 and the electron lens 106 to move the electron beam to control a scanning or imaging of the specimen X. A current source (not shown) is connected with the deflector 120 to provide current to operate the deflector 120 hence control the magnetic field generated by the deflector 120 to control the electron beam. The electron beam applied to the specimen X triggers the specimen X to provide a corresponding electron beam, which is then picked up by a detector 110 to generate an image of the specimen X. In this process, the deflector 120 moves the electron beam in X and Y scanning directions in the same plane for\n\n[0018] Determining the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction may include analyzing an image of the specimen produced by the imaging apparatus.
