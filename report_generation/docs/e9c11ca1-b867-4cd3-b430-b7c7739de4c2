The invention also relates to a related photoacoustic imaging/sensing apparatus.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Photoacoustic imaging is a biomedical imaging modality based on the use of laser-generated ultrasound, and it is considered as one of the most promising imaging techniques to have emerged in recent years. In general, photoacoustic imaging is based on absorption of laser light by specific tissue chromophores to excite ultrasound waves. These ultrasonic waves are encoded with optical properties of the tissue. By recording these waves over the tissue surface, a 3D absorption based image can be reconstructed.\n\n[0003] Apart from obtaining anatomical images, photoa- coustic imaging can also be applied to perform functional imaging, such as in functional optical-resolution photoa- coustic microscopy (OR-PAM), to determine functional properties of the tissues. One properties of particular interest is flow speed of body liquid such as blood. Existing methods to measure blood flow speed are based on various approaches, including photoacoustic Doppler (PAD), pho- toacoustic correlation spectroscopy (PACS), and thermal diffusion flowmetry (TDF). While each of these methods has their own advantages, they all require tens to hundreds of photoacoustic measurements to calculate the flow speed, which is time-consuming and computationally inefficient.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIn accordance with\n\nfirst\n\nof the invention,\n\n[0004] a aspect there is provided a method for determining flow speed based. on photoacoustic imaging or sensing. The method includes receiving multiple photoacoustic signals (e.g., a first pho- toacoustic signal and a second photoacoustic signal) from a sample in response to transmission of multiple laser pulses (e.g., a first laser pulse and a second laser pulse) to the sample; and processing the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a flow model that relates photoacoustic signals with flow speed to determine a flow speed of a liquid flow in the sample. The first pulse laser has a first wavelength and the second laser pulse has a second wavelength different from the first wavelength. Pref- erably, the method is performed using one or more proces- sors, optionally at least partly incorporated in a photoacous- tic imaging or sensing apparatus. The one or more processors may be arranged on the same apparatus, or arranged distributively on a computing network. The sample may be placed in or on a holder or support of the photoa-\n\ncoustic imaging or sensing apparatus.\n\n[0005] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the process- ing includes determining the amplitudes of multiple photoa- coustic signals; and applying the determined amplitudes to the flow model. For example, the processing includes deter- mining a first amplitude of the first photoacoustic signal and a second amplitude of the second photoacoustic signal; and. applying the first and second amplitudes to the flow model.\n\n[0006] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the flow model is an exponential decay model.\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\n[0007] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the flow model relates the first and second amplitude with flow speed\n\nby:\n\n~ Fela P+ pe PB Ag Cather = Fina\u2019 Fiflat\n\n\u5fc6\n\nwhere Pi is the first amplitude, P, is the second amplitude, Fi and Fa are optical fluences associated with the first and second laser pulses, Li and hu are the optical absorption coefficients associated with the first and second laser pulses, A, Te, and b are coeflicients independent of the flow, dt is a time delay between the first and second laser pulses, v is the flow speed.\n\n[0008] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the method further includes transmitting the first laser pulse and second laser pulse to the sample. The transmission may performed using a probe connected to or of a photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus.\n\nthe be\n\n[0009] In some embodiments of the first aspect, the time difference between transmission of the first and second laser pulses may be in the order of nano-seconds, in the order micro-seconds, in the order of milli-seconds, or ete.\n\nof\n\n[0010] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first wavelength of the first laser pulse and the second wave- length of the second laser pulse are isosbestic wavelengths, e.g., for blood.\n\n[0011] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the method further includes processing one of the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a photoacoustic absorption model to determine particulate concentration in liquid.\n\n[0012] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the sample is a human or animal. In one embodiment of the first aspect, the method is performed in vivo. In one embodiment of the first aspect, the liquid is one or more of: blood, lymphatic fluid, etc. The sample may alternatively be a phantom, a dead object, etc.\n\n[0013] In one embodiment of the first aspect in which the liquid is blood, the method also includes processing one of the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a photoacoustic absorption model to deter- mine hemoglobin concentration in the blood.\n\n[0014] In one embodiment of the first aspect in which the liquid is blood, the method includes receiving a third pho- toacoustic signal from a sample in response to transmission of a third laser pulse to the sample, the third laser pulse has a third wavelength different from the first wavelength and the second wavelength; and processing at least one of the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal, and the third photoacoustic signal, based on a linear spectral unmixing model to determine oxygen saturation in the blood. The determined oxygen saturation can be uncom- pensated oxygen saturation in the blood or compensated oxygen saturation in the blood.\n\n[0015] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first, second, and third laser pulses are transmitted sequentially, e.g., from the same laser source, and in such a way that a time difference between transmission of the first and second laser pulses is in the order of micro-seconds or sub-micro- seconds, and a time difference between transmission of the second and third laser pulses is in the order of micro-seconds\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nor\n\nsub-microseconds. The two time differences (between adjacent laser pulses) may be different or the same.\n\n[0016] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the process- ing includes determining a first amplitude of the first pho- toacoustic signal and a third amplitude of the third photoa- coustic signal; and applying the first and third amplitudes to the linear spectral unmixing model. The linear spectral unmixing model may be represented by:\n\noe = rel (ef - 247) - lett - ai\") 502 \u4e09\n\nwhere sO, is the (e.g., uncompensated) oxygen saturation blood,\n\nthe\n\nHes _ Pak Ha PLP 3\u201d\n\nPi and Ps are the first and third amplitudes, Fi and Fa are optical fluences associated with the first and third laser pulses, sx # and \u00e9,,,\u00b0 are molar extinction coefficients of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin at the first and third wavelengths.\n\n[0017] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the process- ing includes processing the first amplitude of the first photoacoustic signal, the second amplitude of the second photoacoustic signal, and the third amplitude of the third photo acoustic signal based on the linear spectral unmixing model; and applying the first, second, and third amplitudes to the linear spectral unmixing model. The linear spectral unmixing model may be a compensated model that relates photoacoustic signals with oxygen saturation, taking into account errors in the photoacoustic signals (e.g., caused by the Griineisen relaxation effect). For example, the linear spectral unmixing model can be represented by:\n\n-= ET\n\nwhere sO, is the (e.g., compensated) oxygen saturation blood,\n\nthe\n\n_ PsFi 1 Paper ED pig thule Fifas \u201d PF VS 1 4 APeott 4 AP,\n\nP,, P3, and Ps are the first, second, and third amplitudes, F, and F, are optical fluences associated with the first and third laser pulses, Nt is a time delay between the first and second. laser pulses, as well as a time delay between the second and. third laser pulses, A, Tu, and b are coeflicients independent of the flow, hi and hu are the optical absorption coefficients associated with the first and second laser pulses, sy \u201c and &,,\u00b0\" are molar extinction coefficients of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin at the first and third wavelengths.\n\n[0018] In accordance with a second aspect of the inven- tion, there is provided a non-transitory computer readable\n\nin\n\nin\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\nmedium storing computer instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, are arranged to cause the one or more processors to perform the method of the first aspect.

The method too egins in step 102, in which laser pulses of different wave- lengths are transmitted to a sample. The sample may be a live object, such as a human or animal, or a dead object, such as a phantom, a device, an apparatus, etc. Then, in step 104, otoacoustic signals are received, e.g., by a probe of a otoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus, from the sample in response to the transmission. Generally, one laser ulse excites one photoacoustic signal. In step 106, the hhotoacoustic signals received are processed by a processor. The processing may be based on different models, depend- ing on the properties to be measured or calculated. After the rocessing, in step 108, one or more properties associated with the sample are determined. The determined properties may be displayed on a display, such as one operably connected with a processor, for view by the user. In one implementation, the method enables simultaneous determi- nation of multiple properties based on a limited number of laser pulses. The method too may also include acquiring an\n\nimage of the sample.\n\n[0064] In one example, the property is blood flow speed (of the sample). In this example, step 102 includes trans-\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nmitting two laser pulses of different wavelengths (e.g., isosbestic wavelengths) to the sample, and step 104 includes receiving two photoacoustic signals from the sample in response to transmission of the two laser pulses. The time difference between transmissions of the two laser pulses may be in the order of micro-seconds, in the order of nano-seconds, etc. Steps 106 and 108 may include deter- mining respective amplitudes of the two photoacoustic sig- nals and applying the determined amplitudes to a flow model that relates photoacoustic signals with flow speed, to deter- mine the blood flow speed. The flow model takes into account errors in the photoacoustic signals (e.g., caused by the Grimeisen relaxation effect).\n\n[0065] In one example, the property may further include hemoglobin concentration in the blood. In this example, steps 106 and 108 may include processing one of the two photoacoustic signals obtained during the blood flow speed measurement based on a photoacoustic absorption model to determine hemoglobin concentration in the blood.\n\n[0066] In one example, the property may further include oxygen saturation in the blood. In this example, step 102 includes transmitting another laser pulse of different wave- length (compared to the other two laser pulses) to the sample, and step 104 includes receiving another photoacous- tic signal from the sample in response to transmission of the other laser pulse. Each of the time differences between transmissions of the two laser pulses may be in the order of micro-seconds, in the order of nano-seconds, ete. The two time differences may be identical. Steps 106 and 108 may include processing at least one of the two photoacoustic signals, and the other photoacoustic signal, based on a linear spectral unmixing model to determine oxygen saturation in the blood. The linear spectral unmixing model may also take into account errors in the photoacoustic signal (e.g., caused. by the Griineisen relaxation effect).\n\n[0067] In one implementation of the method 100, hemo- globin concentration, oxygen saturation, and blood flow can be determined with a single raster scan. Details of the determination of hemoglobin concentration, oxygen satura- tion, and blood flow are as follows.\n\n[0068] A. Hemoglobin Concentration Measurement\n\n[0069] In one embodiment, the hemoglobin concentration is determined based on a photoacoustic absorption model and oxygen saturation is determined based on a linear spectral unmixing method/model, illustrated Y.

Wang, Optical- resolution photoacoustic microscopy of oxygen saturation with nonlinear compensation, Biomed. Opt. Express. 10 (2019) 3061-3069.\n\n[0070] B. Flow Measurement\n\n[0071] In one embodiment, blood flow speed is deter- mined using a dual-pulse method/model or multiple-pulse method/model (uses at least two pulses) in one embodiment of the invention. In photoacoustic imaging or sensing, the earlier photoacoustic excitation may affect the amplitudes of the latter photoacoustic signals. This dependency can change due to one or more of: diffusion, temperature, and. flow. In the present embodiment, two or more photoacoustic signals with only sub-microseconds delay between adjacent signals is utilized for determining flow speed. The present embodiment hypothesizes that the blood flow can signifi- cantly affect the inter-pulse signal amplitude dependency in\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\na short time delay. In this embodiment the relationship between the dual-pulse or multiple-pulse amplitudes and the blood flow speed is modelled. After calibration, the flow speed can be measured or determined from a set of photoa- coustic measurements. The method in the present embodi- ment can be referred to as a dual-pulse flowmetric method.\n\n[0072] In the dual-pulse flowmetric method, two short- delayed nanosecond laser pulses are transmitted to the sample to excite two photoacoustic signals. The time delay between the two laser pulses is St. In linear range, the induced photoacoustic amplitudes Pi and Pa can be approxi- mated as\n\nPyekPonF bar\n\nPoh ot ADF ht day\n\nwhere k is the detection sensitivity, To is a parameter related to photoacoustic excitation efficiency, AT is the increased parameter related to photoacoustic excitation efliciency at the second photoacoustic excitation, m is the light-to-heat conversion coefficient, F, and F, are the optical fluences, and Hi and hua are the optical absorption coefficients at the two laser wavelengths. In one embodiment, when two isosbestic wavelengths, ie. 532 nm and 545 nm, are used, the absorp- tion coefficients at the two wavelengths will be independent of oxygen saturation and Hi/ is a known constant. In the second photoacoustic excitation, AT is modelled as\n\nAT=aF yu, et (2)\n\nwhere a and b are constant coeflicients, Ph is proportional to the first photoacoustic excitation, the exponential decay describes the thermal clearance related to thermal conduc- tion and convection, Tu is a time constant related to thermal conduction, v is the flow speed. The second photoacoustic amplitude can be simplified as\n\n\u628a , , Fable 3 Py = Ee p, 4 TE pa ger ravinnr 8) i Fike Filta\n\nwhere\n\naz = ae\n\nThe coefficients A, Tu, and b are independent of the blood flow and can be determined via system calibration. In superficial tissue, the ratio of F, to F, can be approximated from the tissue surface fluences. To calibrate A, Tu\u3002 and b, the flow speed v and time delays dt can be set to different values and then the three coeflicients can be fit from the photoacoustic measurements. If a different St equals to xdt, other parameters (e.g. surface fluence) remain the same and. flow speed is set to zero, then equation (3) can be simplified as m=Ae~*** and n=Ae\u201c*\u2122\" respectively for time delays dt and dt\u2019. Hence,\n\n1 = re aye hail\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nAfter calibration, the blood flow speed can be determined from the two measured photoacoustic signals using the above.\n\n[0073] C. Oxygen Saturation (sO,) Measurement\n\n[0074] In one embodiment, oxygen saturation level in the blood can be first determined without considering the increased photoacoustic signal amplitude due to other pre- vious excitations. In such case the sO, can be determined. from the photoacoustic signals at two wavelengths (e.g., 532 nm and 558 nm) as follows\n\n\u00b0 =a ra) 1\n\nwhere\n\npa Hes - Ps ol \u4e94 \u5165\n\nP, ; and F, , are the photoacoustic amplitudes and optical fluences at A,=532 nm and A,=558 nm, es \u201c and \u00b0\u00b0 are the molar extinction coefficients of deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO,) at the two wavelengths.\n\n[0075] In another embodiment in which three-pulse exci- tation is applied, the first and second pulses may increase the amplitude of the third photoacoustic signal, leading to an underestimated or otherwise inaccurate sO,. To compensate for this error, the third photoacoustic amplitude is modelled as:\n\nPs = k(Lo + AF tore CO 4 aF apne CO NP sts & Probe: =k onFs tas HAP oars 4. 4p, 2H otra tinier Fibat\n\nwhere 26t is the time delay between the first and third pulses, and Nt is the time delay between the second and third. laser pulses.

The photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus 300 can generate three-wave- length laser pulses and the system 200 can accordingly acquire three-wavelength photoacoustic signals in sub-mi- croseconds. The photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus 300 may be integrated with the system 300 as a single apparatus. The sample in this example includes a tube T holding a liquid, e.g., blood. The tube T is connected to a syringe X that is in turn connected with a pump P. The tube\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\nT\n\nto\n\nis placed in the water tank WT, which can be controlled be at a substantially constant temperature.\n\n[0077] In this embodiment, the photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus 300 includes a pulsed laser source 302, an optical processing unit operably connected with the pulsed laser source 302, and a probe 304. The optical processing unit is arranged to receive and process pulsed laser received. from the pulsed laser source 302 to provide laser pulses of different wavelengths. The probe 304 connects with the optical processing unit to receive the laser pulses and to transmit them to the sample.\n\n[0078] As shown in FIG. 2A, the pulsed laser source 302 is a pump laser, more specifically a nanosecond pulsed laser (532 nm, VPFL-G-20, Spectra-Physics). In this embodiment the pulsed laser source 302 is a single wavelength source. The pulse repetition rate of the pump laser can reach up to 1 MHz and the pulse width is set to 7 ns.\n\n[0079] The optical processing unit includes two sets of half-wave plates HWP1 and HWP2 and polarizing beam- splitters PBS1 and PBS2 arranged to separate the pump eam from the source 302 into three optical paths: a 532 nm direct path, a 545 nm Raman path, and a 558 nm Raman ath. Note that in the Raman paths, two optical fibers are pumped to generate two new wavelengths, i.e., 545 nm and 558 nm. Each optical path is associated with a respective optical processing sub-unit. The half-wave plates HWP1 and HWP2 (WPH10E-532, Thorlabs Inc) upstream of the polar- izing beam-splitters PBS1 and PBS2 are arranged to adjust the power in the optical paths. Optionally, if needed, the luctuations of the laser pulse energy can be compensate using a photodiode (not shown). The average, standard deviation (SD) and drift of the pulsed light energy for these wavelengths (532 nm, 545 nm, 558 nm) were tested during 66.7 mins. The normalized average and SD for 532 nm, 545 nm, and 558 nm are 33545+24.4, 33887+36.5, and 34522245.5. And the energy drifts for these 3 wavelengths after 66.7 mins are 8%, 10% and 9%, which are relatively stable.\n\n[0080] In the 545 nm Raman path, a 50 m polarization- maintaining single-mode fiber 310 (PM-S405-XP, NUFERN) is used to generate the 545 nm pulse through stimulated-Raman-scattering effect and to delay the pulse by 260 ns (as measured by a photodiode (not shown). The theoretical time delay in a 50 m fiber is ~243 ns but due to the time delay in free space the actual time delay in this example is increased. By adjusting the incident pulse energy and polarization state, the 50 m fiber 310 can maximize the pulse energy of the 545 nm and avoids generating other stokes wavelengths. In this embodiment, the energy and polarization are adjusted to generate only the first wave- length (545 nm) but not other higher order Stokes wave- lengths. The beam combination is for 532 nm and 545 nm. A long-pass filter LPF (T540lpxr, CHROMA) is placed after the 50 m Raman fiber to pass the 545 nm and reflect the 532 nm. Respective fiber couplers FC3 and FC4 are placed upstream and downstream of the single-mode fiber 310. For system calibration, another 30 m polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber (not shown) is used to generate and delay the 545 nm by 163 ns.\n\n[0081] In the 558 nm Raman path, the pump beam is coupled into a loom graded-index multi-mode fiber 320 (GIMMSC(50/125)HT, FIBERCORE) to generate 558 nm laser pulse with a 512 ns time delay. Because the stimulated- Raman-scattering threshold of a single-mode fiber is limited\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nto its length, the highest 558 nm pulse energy generated by\n\na loom single-mode fiber may not be enough for sensitive photoacoustic imaging or sensing in some applications, thus this path uses a multi-mode fiber 320 not a single-mode fiber. A long fiber is easier to generate Stokes wavelength via stimulated-Raman-scattering and makes the Raman thresh- old lower. In this embodiment a loom graded-index multi- mode fiber 320 is used to increase the stimulated-Raman- scattering threshold. Although the loom stimulated-Raman- scattering fiber 320 is multi-mode for the pump light, the generated 558 nm is nearly single mode due to the Raman beam clean-up effect. A half-wave plate HWP3 adjusts the polarization of the incident light to maximize the 558 nm energy. A short pass filter SPF (RPES70SP, OMEGA) down- stream of the loom fiber 320 is arranged to reject wave- lengths longer than 570 nm. Respective fiber couplers FC1 and FC2 are placed upstream and downstream of the multi-\n\nmode fiber 320.\n\n[0082] A 550 nm long-pass dichroic mirror 340 (TS50Ipxr-UF1, CHROMA) is used to combine the 545 nm and 558 nms. A beam splitter, e.g., a 10/90 beam splitter 350, combines the direct 532 nm with the delayed 545 nm and 558 nm. A variable neutral density filter NDF1, NDF2, NDF3 (NDC-50C-2, Thorlabs Inc) is added to each respec- tive path to adjust the output energy. Finally, the three wavelengths are coupled into an OR-PAM probe 304 via a fiber coupler FCS and 2 m single-mode fiber 360 (P1-460B- FC-2, Thorlabs Inc).\n\n[0083] In this example, the fiber coupling efficiencies for all the single-mode beams are higher than 50%. When coupling the 558 nm beam to the 2 m single-mode fiber, because the 558 nm is not 100% single mode, the coupling efficiency is ~30%. The pulse energy on the sample surface for each wavelength is higher than 100 nJ.\n\n[0084] In the probe 304, the laser beam from the 2 m fiber 360 is focused by a pair of achromatic doublets (AC064- 013-A, Thorlabs). The focused optical beam is reflected on an optical/acoustic beam combiner, transmits through a plano-concave lens (45-697, Edmund optics), then illumi- nates the sample S. Induced ultrasonic waves (photoacoustic signals generated by the sample in response to the laser pulses) are collimated by the plano-concave lens, transmits through the optical/acoustic beam combiner, and detected by a 50-MHz broadband piezoelectric transducer (V214-BC- RM, Olympus). The focused optical beam is coaxially and. confocally aligned with the focused ultrasonic detection beam to optimize the detection sensitivity.\n\nAt each\n\nlaser\n\nthe laser\n\n[0085] pump pulse, apparatus generates three temporally separated laser pulses at 532 nm, 545 nm, and 558 nm, and the system 200 sequentially acquires three depth-resolved A-lines at the three wave- lengths. Volumetric photoacoustic images are acquired by raster scanning the photoacoustic probe in the lateral plane. The lateral resolution is 3.4 um. The time to acquire one set of three-wavelength photoacoustic signals is ~500 ns. If the mechanical scanning or blood flow speed is less than 1 cm/s, the misalignment among the three A-lines would be smaller than 5 nm, which is negligible compared with the lateral resolution. Other details of the system 200 including the amplifier (\u201cAmp\u201d), the data acquisition module (\u201c\u201cDAQ\u201d), and the processor (\u201cPC\u201d) are omitted for simplicity. Briefly, the amplifier is arranged to amplify the received photoa- coustic signals; the data acquisition module is arranged to\n\nregulate the received amplified photoacoustic signals; and\n\n300\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\nthe processor is arranged to control operation of the system 200, including providing trigger pulse to operate the source 302, providing trigger pulse to operate the probe 304, providing trigger pulse to operate the data acquisition mod- ule, etc. The processor may also be used to process the photoacoustic signals to determine the one or more param- eters associated with the sample, such as those parameters discussed above with respect to FIG. 1.\n\n[0086] FIG. 2B is a graph showing the time differences between different laser pulses provided by the system 200 2A.\n\nFIG.\n\nof\n\n[0087]\n\n\u2018To validate the exponential model in equation (3),\n\nan experiment was performed to measure the decay con- stants at different blood flow speeds ranging from 0 to 23 m/s in a blood phantom as a sample in the system of FIG. 2A. The phantom is anticoagulated bovine blood filled in transparent rubber tube (0.25 mm inner diameter, TYGON S-54-HL, Norton Performance Plastics, NJ). The blood flow speed is set by a syringe pump. The photoacoustic probe and the blood sample are immersed in a water tank for acoustic coupling. The laser repetition rate is 4 kHz. The pulse energy on the sample surface is 100 nJ for each wavelength. The exponential decay model is fitted with the least square criteria. The exponential decay constants at different set flow speeds are plotted in FIG. 3A. As expected, the decay constant is a linear function of the flow speed with a determination coefficient (R*) of 0.952, indicating the high dependence of the increased photoacoustic amplitude on the flow speed. A, Tu and b are fitted as 0.11+0.01 (SD), 10.19+0.85 (SD) and 0.30+0.04 (SD). With the fitted coef- ficients, the flow speed can be determined from two pho- toacoustic signals. Using the same experimental setup, the flow speed measurement was validated in blood phantom. As shown in FIG. 3B, the measured flow speed is averaged. by 100 times and compared with the set flow speed. The measured flow speed is proportional to the set flow speed, that the is for\n\nshowing dual-pulse approach measuring the blood flow speed. [0088] Dual-pulse flowmetry in the above embodiment\n\napplicable\n\nwas used to measure blood flow speed in the mouse ear. FIGS. 4A to 4G show the related results. Specifically, FIG. 4A shows photoacoustic imaging or sensing of blood vessels in the mouse ear acquired with 532 nm wavelength; FIG. 4B shows flow speed image measured by dual-pulse flowmetry in the above embodiment. FIGS. 4C and 4D are flow speed rofiles along with the dashed line 410 in FIG. 4A measured y the existing photoacoustic Doppler method and the dual-pulse method. Details of the existing photoacoustic Doppler method can be found in H. Fang, K. Maslov, L. V Wang, photoacoustic Doppler flow measurement in optically scattering media, Appl. Phys. Lett. 91 (2007) 264103, J. Brunker, P. Beard, Velocity measurements in whole blood using acoustic resolution photoacoustic Doppler, Biomed. Opt. Express. 7 (2016) 2789-2806, R. Zhang, J. Yao, K. I.

FIG. 4E illustrates the linear relation- ship between the photoacoustic Doppler results and the\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\ndual-pulse results. A linear fitting gives the R2 of 0.9384. Vein is the flow speed measured by photoacoustic Doppler method. V545/s32 is the flow speed measured by the dual- pulse method. FIG. 4F shows the spectrum of the dual-pulse flow speed in the artery as labeled with a star 420 in FIG. 4A. A heartbeat rate of 4.6 Hz is observed. FIG. 4G shows the time-domain blood flow speed in the artery which is aver- aged by 100 times. The thicker line is a lowpass filtered result cut off at 10 Hz.\n\n[0089] The in vivo experiment to obtain FIGS. 4A to 4G was carried out on anaesthetized female BALB/c mice (4 weeks). The region of interest (ROI) shown in FIG. 4A is 0.5 mmx0.5 mm. The raster scanning takes 40 seconds with a 10-Hz b-scan rate. The laser repetition rate is 4 kHz and the pulse energy for each wavelength is ~80 nJ. Using the fitted model, the blood flow speed in the ROI is calculated at each pixel from the photoacoustic signals at 545 nm and 532 nm as shown in FIG. 4B. In the artery, the averaged flow speed. is ~6 mm/s. In the vein, the averaged flow speed is ~3 mm/s.\n\n[0090]\n\nFor\n\ncomparison,\n\nboth\n\nDoppler\n\nphotoacoustic\n\n(PAD) flowmetry and dual-pulse flowmetry are used to measure the same blood flow speed in the mouse ear. Because PAD needs to use multiple A-lines to calculate flow speed, the scanning mode is changed to acquiring multiple successive A-lines at each point. The photoacoustic probe was scanned along a dashed line 410 in FIG. 4A and the flow speed profile was measured using the two methods (existing photoacoustic Doppler method and the dual-pulse method of the present embodiment). 200 successive A-lines at each point were used to do autocorrelation for PAD calculation. In the dual-pulse method of the present embodiment, each pair of 545 nm and 532 nm photoacoustic data can be used. to calculate flow speed. For comparison, the dual-pulse flow result was averaged over all A-line pairs. Flow results calculated by the two methods are shown in FIGS. 4C and 4D. The two results were compared by fitting them to a linear regression model, as shown in FIG. 4E. The determi- nation coeflicient R? is 0.938, indicating that the flow results\n\nmeasured by the two methods match well. To further demonstrate the high speed of dual-pulse\n\n[0091] flowmetry, the mouse heartbeat in the artery was measured. The measurement spot is labeled with a star 420 in FIG. 4A. The maximum amplitudes of multiple successive A-lines was calculated and the blood flow speeds were determined. using equation (3). Fourier transformation was applied to the blood flow speeds at multiple A-lines. The frequency spec- trum shows a peak at ~4.6 Hz in FIG. 4F, which matches with the heartbeat rate of the mouse under anesthesia. The heart beating can also be visible in the time domain as shown in FIG. 4G. The data was averaged 100 times and then filtered with a 10-Hz lowpass filter. The heartbeat cycles become obvious in the measured blood flow speeds. This result shows the dual-pulse method is advantageous in A-line based flow imaging.\n\n[0092] Using the three-wavelength system 200 of FIG. 2A, the present invention can be used to simultaneously quantify hemoglobin concentration, blood flow speed, and oxygen saturation in vivo. One laser pulse may increase the photoacoustic amplitude generated by the following laser pulses (e.g., because an earlier laser pulse may increase the photoacoustic excitation efficiency F of a subsequent laser pulse). This may cause a systematic error in sO, calculation. With system calibration, it has been shown above that the error can be compensated for in the sO, imaging. In vivo sO,\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\ncomparison results are shown in FIGS. 5A to 6E. The laser\n\nrepetition rate is 4 kHz. Pulsed energy for each wavelength is ~80 nJ. The imaging area is 8.75 mmx10 mm. FIG. 5A shows the normalized hemoglobin concentration imaged at 532 nm. The system has enough SNR (>20 dB) to show the capillaries. The blood flow speed calculated by the dual- pulse method is shown in FIG. 5B. Four artery-vein pairs of vessels labelled with the lines are selected to plot profiles of the blood flow speed, as shown in FIGS. 6A to 6D. From the root to the tip of the ear, the blood flow speed in the artery decreases from ~7 mm/s to ~3.3 mm/s, and in the vein, the flow speed maintains ~2 mm/s. sO, images without and with compensation are shown in FIGS. 4C and 4D. Artery-vein pairs labeled with the lines are selected to compare the sO, values. As shown in FIG. 6E, without compensation, the artery sO, values at the first to the fourth spots are 0.9420.01 (SE), 0.92+0.02 (SE), 0.91+0.02 (SE) and 0.90+0.02 (SE), and the vein sO, values at the same spots are 0.56+0.01 (SE), 0.520.02 (SE), 0.50+0.02 (SE), 0.50+0.01 (SE). With com- pensation, the artery sO, values increase to 0.98+0.02 (SE), 0.96#0.02 (SE), 0.9520.02 (SE), 0.94+0.01 (SE), and the vein sO, values become 0.69+0.02 (SE), 0.6420.02 (SE),\n\n0.6320.02 (SE), 0.63+0.01 (SE).\n\n[0093] Referring to FIG. 7, there is shown a schematic diagram of an exemplary information handling system 700 that can be used as a computer, computing device, informa- tion processing system, or the like, to perform the method of any of the above embodiments.

A dual-pulse approach can be used to measure the blood flow with only two short-delayed A-lines. A dual-pulse (or multiple-pulse) flowmetry can be performed based on a series of A-lines. The principle originates from the first laser pulse\u2019s heating\n\na\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\neffect on the second, subsequent pulse, which can be affected\n\nby the flow speed. An exponential model can be used to quantify the blood flow speed from two photoacoustic measurements. Based on the exponential model, the error in sO, quantification can also be compensated for. Simultane- ous multi-parameter imaging can be achieved. Dual-pulse flowmetry of the above embodiments can accurately, quickly, and efficiently measure blood flow speed. It requires only two photoacoustic measurements in sub-microseconds. Unlike conventional functional OR-PAM, the dual-pulse lowmetry and three- -wavelength OR-PAM do not need multiple repeated A-line imaging at one spot, which saves imaging time, increases throughput, and may mitigate poten- tial motion artifacts.
