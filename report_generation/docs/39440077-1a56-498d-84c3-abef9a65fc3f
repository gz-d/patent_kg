This number is both incon- venient to users and eventually leads to electronic waste prob- lems. Inductive or wireless charging apparatus that can charge more than one electronic product have been proposed. Two different approaches have been proposed for the ac mag- netic flux generation, namely \u201chorizontal flux\u201d and \u201cvertical flux\u201d method.\n\nInductive electronic chargers have been developed for use with some types of portable electronic equipment such as electric toothbrushes. Inductive chargers have also been pro- posed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,356,049, 6,301,128, and 6,118,249. These inductive type chargers, however, use traditional trans- ormer designs with windings wound around ferrite magnetic cores. The main magnetic flux between the primary (energy- transmitting) winding and secondary (energy-receiving) winding has to go through the magnetic core materials. An alternative contactless charger [Chang-Gyun Kim; Dong- Hyun Seo; Jung-Sik You; Jong-Hu Park; Cho, B. H., \u201cDesign of a contactless battery charger for cellular phone,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Volume: 48, Issue: 6, December 2001 Page(s): 1238-1247.] proposed also uses magnetic cores as the main structure for the coupled trans- ormer windings. However, these battery chargers do not use a planar structure and each charger is able to charge only one\n\nIn both cases, the entire surface of the charging surface is energized for energy transfer. Although the concept of a \u201clocalized charging principle\u201d has been disclosed previously in GB2389720A, U.S. Pat. No. 7,1642,55 and WO2007/ 019806, so far there is no systematic approach in designing an inductive battery charging pad that can meet the energy- efficiency, safety, electromagnetic compatibility require- ments simultaneously. In \u201cT. Sekitani, M. Takamiya, Y. Noguchi, S. Nakano, Y. Kato, K. Hizu, H. Kawaguchi, T. Sakurai, T. Someya, \u201cA large-area flexible wireless power transmission sheet using printed plastic MEMS switches and organic field-effect transistors,\u2019 JEDM '06, International Electron Devices Meeting, December 2006, pp. 1-4,\u201d a MEMS method has been proposed for inductive charging system, but such approach is restricted to relatively low- power and is very costly.\n\nTwo different approaches to planar battery charging devices have recently been proposed. The first type of planar battery charger modifies the rotating machine concept by flattening the \u201cround shape\u201d of the motor into a \u201cpancake shape,\u201d as shown in FIG. 1(a) and reported in GB2399225A, GB2398176A, WO2004/038888A, GB2388716A, US2003- 210106A, GB2392024A, and GB2399230A. The magnetic flux lines 1 flow along (i.e., roughly parallel to) the planar charging surface 2. However, such a horizontal flux approach requires a vertical surface to pick up the ac flux for voltage induction (FIG. 1(6)) and this limitation makes it difficult to design a slim energy-receiving module that can be unobtru- sively housed inside the equipment to be charged. Typically, as shown in FIG. 1(4) the secondary winding needs to be wound round a magnetic core 3.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe second approach (shown for example in WO03/ 105308A, GB2389720A, GB2399446A, U.S. Pat.

Since the lines of flux leave the charging surface vertically, the entire surface of the load in principle can be used to pick up the flux [S. C. Tang, S. Y.R. Hui and H.

In practice, the area of the battery pack or the back cover of a portable electronic product can be used for the energy-receiving coil. This vertical flux approach makes it easier than the horizontal flux approach to design a slim energy-receiving module. Electro-magnetic shielding 6 is provided on the side of the charging surface opposite from the side on which a device to be charged is placed. This shielding prevents flux from being directed in the wrong direction (which would be a safety issue\u2014especially if the battery charging platform was placed a metal surface) and enhances the magnetic flux that is available for battery charging. Electromagnetic shielding is also added on the side of the energy-receiving coil opposite from the side to be placed on the charging surface as shown for example in FIG. 2(8). In such a battery charging platform a secondary winding is provided that is associated with a battery to be charged. The secondary winding picks up the magnetic flux and generates a charging voltage that is pro- vided to the battery. Generally the secondary winding would be formed integrally with the battery such that a battery or a device containing the battery is placed on the charging sur- face with the secondary coil parallel to the surface such that it receives a maximum amount of magnetic flux. Alternatively, however, the secondary winding may be electrically con- nected to the battery but physically separate therefrom. In such a case the secondary winding may be formed as part of a secondary charging module that is placed on the charging surface. This possibility is particularly useful to allow the charging platform to be used with older electronic devices that are not otherwise designed for use with such a platform.\n\nume:\n\non\n\nUS 7,915,858 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nnetic shielding on the side of the winding opposite from the\n\nof columns, wherein the matrix Switching array comprises\n\nside to be placed on the charging Surface.

In addition, the bi-directional communica- tion should provide information for the battery charge condi- tion. When the loads are fully charged, the selected transmit- ter windings should stop energy transfer in order to reduce\n\nIn order for the charging pad to charge a wide range of portable electronic loads, a methodology is proposed that involves the combined use of several basic principles and technical features. In the following description, the primary energy-transmitting windings in the charging pad will be called \u201ctransmitter windings\u201d and the secondary energy-re- ceiving windings inside the electronic loads will be called \u201creceiver windings\u201d.\n\nIn the following description, these integrated technical will be explained in more detail.\n\nIn embodiments of this invention, (i) the receiver winding are larger than the transmitter windings, (ii) the receiver winding should fully cover at least one transmitter winding wherever the electronic load that contains the receiver wind- ing is placed on the charging surface of the charging pad and iii) one transmitter winding is sufficient to provide enough power transfer for the electronic load under consideration for the charging pad. As discussed above a multilayer structure of stacked windings can be used to enhance the magnetic flux for the same foot-print area. Preferably the area ratio of the receiver winding and one transmitter winding must be mini- mized that condition is satisfied.\n\nthe receiver winding 8 should be larger than the transmitter windings 7 in the sense that the receiver winding 8 should. enclose a greater area than a transmitter winding 7, (ii) the receiver winding 8 must fully cover at least one transmitter winding 7 wherever the electronic load is placed on the charg- ing surface of the charging pad and (iii) one transmitter wind- ing 7 is sufficient to provide enough power transfer to charge the battery of an electronic device intended to be chargeable on the charging pad. In this example, it is assumed that the receiver winding 8 is circular. However, the skilled reader will understand that the receiver winding 8 can be of other shapes such as any polygonal shape such as a rectangular shape, or it may be an oval shape as illustrated in FIG. 4. FIG. 4 shows typical examples of receiver windings of rectangular and circular shape. The receiver winding is embedded inside the electronic device (or at least with a battery if the battery is to be charged separately from the device) for mutual coupling with the transmitter winding. In other words, the transmitter winding is equivalent to the primary winding ofa transformer and the receiver winding is equivalent to the secondary wind-\n\nThe basic concept of the localized charging principle is to energize only the relevant transmitter windings that are directly underneath the receiving windings of the electronic loads for energy transfer. In other words, the localized charg- ing principle is load-position dependent. It only energizes the areas on the charging surface where the electronic loads are placed. In preferred embodiments of this invention, it is pro- posed to energize only one transmitter winding for each elec- tronic load or at least only those covered by the electronic load.

If the receiver winding 8 does extend beyond the peripheral area it may be considered to be not properly placed on the charging platform.\n\nFIG. 5 is such that even with a slight movement of the large receiver winding 8 in any direction, the receiver winding 8 will always enclose or cover at least one of the smaller trans- mitter windings 7. It will be understood that while FIG. 5 only shows four transmitter windings 7 in practice these four wind- ings are only a small part of a larger regular array of similar windings.\n\nIf the receiver winding 8 covers more than one transmitter winding 7, as may often occur, then if one transmitter winding 7 provides enough power transfer for the electronic load under consideration, it is only necessary to excite one trans- mitter winding 7. In order to select the transmitter winding(s) 7 to be energized, each transmitter winding 7 can be periodi- cally energized for a short time at low power. If there is a receiver winding 8 enclosing a transmitter winding 7, the impedance of the transmitter winding 7 will be changed and can be detected indicating the presence of a load. However, load detection alone is not the only condition for determining the selection of the transmitter windings for energy transfer. Load identification and compatibility check are also needed and will be discussed further below. Furthermore if two trans- mitter windings 7 are found to be covered by a single receiver winding 8, a choice may be made as to which of the transmit- ter windings is to be energized based for example upon which of the transmitter windings 7 couples the most strongly to the receiver winding 8.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 5, x has the relationship with d, as given by equation (1):\n\nxvid aw\n\nThen the diameter of the receiver winding, D, can be expressed by (2):\n\nd= Sexsxt$ 24+ v2 @\n\nThe area ratio between one receiver and transmitter windings\n\n\u7ad9 2 Areceiver ADA22 _ receiver _ = ad {27 (1+ V2)\" = 5.8284 A transmitter\n\nIn order to selectively energies the appropriate transmitter windings 7 to charge a load, several matrix power switching circuits are proposed and illustrated by way of example in the context of the winding array structure in FIG. 7. In general, the transmitter windings can be grouped into zones with the number of zones and the number of transmitter windings within each zone depending on the dimensions of the charg- ing surface of the charging pad and the transmitter windings. In FIG. 7, the transmitter windings are grouped into ten zones and each zone has nine transmitter windings. Another advan- tage of the zone approach is that the winding structure as well as the electronics (power switches, controller, etc.) in one zone is scalable and duplicable.\n\nUsing the same argument, other transmitter windings of other shapes and packing methods can be used. For example, FIG. 6 shows the hexagonal packing of hexagonal spiral transmitter windings 7 and an overlying circular receiver winding 8. Again, in the event of any slight movement of the larger receiver winding 8 in any direction at least one trans- mitter winding 7 is still enclosed by the receiver winding. Again, as with FIG. 5 it will be understood that while FIG. 6 only shows three transmitter windings, in practice these windings are only part of a larger regular array of like wind- ings.\n\nFIG. 8 shows one embodiment ofa matrix power electronic switching circuit for selecting and energizing the appropriate transmitter windings in a winding zone. The de link voltage is provided by a boost converter in this example. The matrix power switching circuit comprises a power inverter consist- ing of four high-frequency power switches 10 that in FIG. 8 are implemented by power mosfets driven by gate drivers 11 and that are switched to provide high-frequency excitation for the selected transmitter windings. The winding selection is made by closing the appropriate row-switches $1, $2, 83 and column-switches S4, S5, S6. S1 to S6 are bi-directional switches that do not need high-frequency switching. If cho- sen, they will be turned on during the charging period. For example, if the transmitter winding in the middle of the zone is selected, row-switch S2 and column-switch S5 will be turned on during the charging period. Similarly, the top right-\n\nIn this example the relationship between D and d is:\n\nD=2d\n\n(4)\n\nThe area ratio between one receiver and transmitter winding is:\n\nAreceiver Arransmitter\n\nThe area ratio is an important factor in the optimal trans- mitter and receiver winding coverage theory. This ratio should be minimized subject to the conditions that the receiver winding is larger than a transmitter winding (i.e., the ratio can never be 1 or less) and that wherever the receiver winding is placed on the charging surface at least one trans- mitter winding is always fully covered. From equations (3) and (5), it is clear that winding arrangement in FIG. 6 is preferable to that in FIG. 5 because it has a lower area ratio.\n\nFIG. 9 shows a second example for this winding selection and excitation principle. This consists of three row-inverter legs (each consisting of a totem-pole switching pair) and three column-inverter legs. For example, in order to select the middle winding for excitation, the middle row-inverter and the middle column-inverter can be switched to generate ac power excitation.\n\nThe load-dependent selection of the transmitter windings illustrated with the aid of FIG. 7 which shows four elec- tronic loads (illustrated by circular receiver windings 8) are placed on an array of hexagonal transmitter windings 7.

The charging pad. should only charge the loads if they are compatible with the charging pad. For example, a cigarette lighter should not be charged even though its presence is detected. The choice of communication methods can be selected from at least, but not restricted to, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, ASK, FSK, NFC/RFID etc.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 10, the voltage source, V,, can be con- trolled by MCUp.

Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such alternative aspects as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n\nThe basic implementation of bi-directional communica- tion by using amplitude modulation is shown in FIG. 10. Data can be transferred in both directions, i.e., from the receiver to the transmitter, and from the transmitter to the receiver.\n\nTo transmit data from the receiver to the transmitter, the micro-controller at the receiver side (MCUs) controls a switch S,, to change the loading conditions in order to achieve transferred power modulation by connecting or disconnect- ing resistor R,, which can be detected by a sensing resistor Rs at the transmitter side. After demodulation at the trans- mitter side, the data is then forwarded to the transmitter con- troller (MCUp) and a central processing unit (CPU). The operation flowchart of the system is given in FIG. 11 and the details of each mode is explained as follows: 20\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n1. A planar battery charging system, comprising:\n\na primary power transmission side formed of an array of primary windings adapted to generate magnetic flux substantially perpendicular to a charging surface; and\n\na secondary power receiving side comprising a secondary winding associated with a battery to be charged and being adapted to receive said magnetic flux when placed on said charging surface, said secondary winding being provided with electromagnetic shielding on the side of said winding opposite from the side to be placed on the charging surface;\n\na system scan zone check periodically the loading condition by exciting each transmitter winding for a very short time at a low AC power level (i.e., much lower than the normal charging power level). The loading condition of each winding will be detected. Dur- ing this scanning mode, MCUs is not activated at all. The transferred power is only consumed by a large resistor R,,,, and is much smaller than the typical charging power absorbed. by a battery. Such transferred power is then detected by R,.,, at the transmitter side. When the detected power is higher than the low threshold value and below the over-power limits, the load is identified as a possible load. The position of the load can also be known by searching fora local maximum amongst different transmitter windings. When no load or an invalid load is detected, the system will loop back and repeat the system scan. The use of very low power in this scanning process is also for safety reasons and prevents the inverter circuit from facing a short-circuit or near-short-circuit situa- tion, particularly when the load is a piece of metal or cigarette\n\nwherein the relative dimensions of the primary windings and the secondary winding are chosen to meet the con- ditions that (a) the area enclosed by the secondary wind- ing is greater than the area enclosed by a primary wind- ing, (b) the secondary winding or said shielding will always fully enclose a primary winding when a second- ary winding is placed on said charging surface, and (c)a single primary winding generates sufficient power to charge a said battery.\n\n2. planar battery charging system as claimed in claim wherein the ratio of the area enclosed by the secondary winding to the area enclosed by a primary winding is mini- while being consistent with conditions (a) and (b).\n\n[he planar battery charging system as claimed in claim erein said primary windings are arranged in a regular of identical size and shape.\n\nIn the data exchange mode, the local maximum and the nearest coil is identified in the previous system scan mode will perform a scanning for compatible devices.
