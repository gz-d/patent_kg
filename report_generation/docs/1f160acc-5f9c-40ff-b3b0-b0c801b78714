For decades, these huge numbers of non-coding RNAs (ncR- NAs) have been considered as \u201cdark matter\u201d and their functions remained to be developed. These ncRNAs, espe- cially long non-coding ribonucleic acids (IncRNA, defined as ncRNAs with more than 200 nucleotides in length) have been of interest recently, which were generally considered to be an important part participating in epigenetic regulation. For example, various IncRNAs were involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation, the dysregulation of which is associated with progression and metastasis of various can- cers.\n\n[0004] XIST (X-inactivation specific transcript) is one of the first widely studied IncRNAs, which directs X chromo- some inactivation (XCI) in female mammals, thus balancing the dose of genes between XY males and XX females. Its ability to constrain chromatin binding proteins makes it possible to label allele and cis-regulate transcription. At present, XC] and XIST have become exemplary models for understanding the epigenetic regulation of IncRNA.\n\n[0005] The interaction between IncRNA and RNA binding proteins (RBP) determines the function and fate of RNA molecules. Up to 8.5 percent of the entire human proteome was predicted to have RNA binding properties, further demonstrating the multiple functions of IncRNA in various biological events. Mutations in IncRNA transcripts or changes in the abundance of IncRNA may alter their asso- ciated proteome, leading to health problems. The identifi- cation of IncRNA-related proteins will reveal the molecular mechanisms of the cell function in complex human diseases.\n\n[0006] Although there is a growing recognition of the functional importance of RBP, there are significant technical limitations in elucidating IncRNA-protein interactions in living cells at present. Current methods depend mainly on chemical or UV mediated cross-linking between RNA and. protein molecules to achieve effective enrichment and sepa- ration for the complex. Such procedures may produce non- systematic biases in physiological situations and mask the interaction proteins.\n\nal.\n\n[0007] Recently, Ramanathan, M. et developed a RaPID method that integrates the promiscuous but efficient biotin ligase BASU with a AN peptide navigation system that recognizes the stem-loop of RNA BoxB. Compared with other biotin ligase variants, BASU remains inactive until it is rapidly activated by the high concentration of\n\nfor\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\nexogenous biotin in the culture medium, thereby labeling proteins nearby in a smaller labeling radius (~10 nm) in a shorter reaction time. This feature greatly reduces non- specific background noise. However, the target RNA needs to be artificially fused with the BoxB stem-loop close to the RBP binding region, and it needs to be expressed ectopically in the cell. Therefore, RaPID must compromise on three important factors: firstly, the abundance of ectopically expressed target RNA greatly exceeds the endogenous level of the transcript, resulting in a non-physiological balance of the interaction between RNA and RBP; secondly, the incor- poration of the hairpin structure BoxB into the target RNA may interfere with the natural structure of the transcript, thereby changing its binding protein; thirdly, BASU can only label the RBP adjacent to the stem loop of BoxB at the 5' or 3' end of the RNA, therefore, some important RBPs may be missed, especially for long transcripts such as XIST (~19 kb). Briefly, the potential shortcomings, including the loss of cellular background, extensive molecular engineer- ing and possible destruction of the natural structure of RNA, greatly limit the wide application of this method.\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n[0008] An object of the present invention is to provide novel method for determining long non-coding ribonucleic acid (IncRNA) interaction proteins.\n\n[0009] \u2018The present invention provides a CRISPR-Assisted RNA-Protein Interaction Detection (CARPID) method, which integrates CRISPR/CasRx based RNA targeting and roximity markers to identify binding proteins of specific IncRNAs within cells at natural state.\n\n[0010] \u2018The inventive technology for detecting CRISPR- assisted RNA-protein interaction can be used as a novel and owerful method to find the interaction proteins of IncRNA in living cells. The method uses the highly specific CRISPR/ CasRx system fused to the promiscuous but efficient biotin ligase BASU. The interaction with various proteins plays a central role in the regulatory activity of IncRNA. The resent invention relates to a fusion protein of BASU and dCasRx, which comprises the dCasRx of compact Type VI-D CRISPR single-effect system, which can find the target IncRNA by specific gRNA co-transfected into the target cell. Once binding to the target IncRNA, it can enable BASU to specifically biotinylate effector proteins nearby activated by a high concentration of biotin. The biotinylated protein is separated by streptavidin affinity-coupled magnetic beads, then eluted, trypsin-digested and quantitatively analyzed by label-free mass spectrometry. As a control group, cells transfected with BASU-dCasRx but without gRNA are used\n\nas background.\n\n[0011] At the time of the results analysis, the proteins identified in the specific gRNA group are statistically com- ared with the control group (no gRNA) for enrichment or reduction. Rank product is a non-parametric statistical method used to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) of enrichment. In order to generate a list of specific interaction proteins, the critical value is set as enrichment=2 times and. FDR<0.05. The obtained protein can be used for gene ontology analysis or protein interaction network analysis. In addition, a comprehensive analysis is performed on the target protein by using gRNA targeting different regions, thereby obtaining a high-resolution spectrum of the target IncRNA interaction protein.\n\na\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\n[0012] In an aspect, the present invention thus provides fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx.\n\n[0013] According to the embodiment of the present inven- tion, the fusion protein can be BASU-dCasRx, or dCasRx- BASU.\n\n[0014] In another aspect, the invention further provides expression vector for expressing the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx. Preferably, it is a mammalian expression vector.\n\n[0015] In another aspect, the invention further provides a composition comprising: the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx and/or the expression vector for express- ing the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx, as well as a gRNA targeting the target IncRNA.\n\n[0016] In another aspect, the invention further provides a kit for determining IncRNA interaction proteins, compris- ing: the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx and/or the expression vector for expressing the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx, as well as a gRNA targeting the target IncRNA. Preferably, the kit further comprises a control reagent without gRNA (for example, co-transfected with the gRNA empty vector and the BASU-dCasRx fusion protein expression vector).\n\n[0017] In another aspect, the present invention further provides a method for determining IncRNA interaction proteins, comprising:\n\n[0018] co-transfecting the expression vector for express- ing the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx, and gRNA that specifically targets the target IncRNA in a target cell, thereby BASU specifically biotin-labeling effector pro- teins nearby;\n\n[0019] isolating the biotinylated proteins for analysis to determine the IncRNA interaction proteins.\n\n[0020] According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, in the method for determining IncRNA-interac- tion proteins of the present invention, specifically, the bioti- nylated protein can be separated by streptavidin affinity- coupled magnetic beads, and then eluted and trypsin digested, and quantitatively analyzed by a label-free mass spectrometry.\n\n[0021] According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the method for determining the IncRNA interac- tion protein of the present invention is used to determine the IncRNA interaction protein in living cells.\n\n[0022] According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the method for determining IncRNA-interaction proteins of the present invention further comprises: statisti- cally comparing the protein identified in the specific gRNA group with the control group without gRNA for enrichment or reduction.\n\n[0023] According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the method for determining a IncRNA-interaction protein of the present invention further comprises: calculat- ing the false discovery rate of enrichment by Rank product; more preferably, the critical value is set as enrichment=2 times and FDRs0.05.\n\n[0024] According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the method for determining a IncRNA-interaction protein of the present invention further comprises:\n\n[0025] performing a genetic ontological analysis or pro- tein interaction network analysis on the obtained proteins; and/or performing a comprehensive analysis on the target\n\na\n\nan\n\na\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\na\n\nprotein by using gRNA targeting different regions to obtain high-resolution spectrum of the target IncRNA interaction protein.\n\n[0026] In another aspect, the invention further provides method for analyzing enriched interaction proteins to spe- cific regions of target IncRNA, comprising:\n\na\n\n[0027] performing an enrichment analysis on the proteins with more than one peptide fragments detected; wherein the proteins preferably comprise human keratin;\n\n[0028] normalizing and logarithmizing a LFQ abundance of each group;\n\n[0029] replacing a missing value by a minimum value representing the detection limit of mass spectrometer;\n\n[0030] determining the protein that is statistically enriched samples of the gRNA transfection group compared to the control group transfected with gRNA empty vectors by rank product:\n\nin\n\n[0031] a protein with the adjusted p-values0.05 and abundance change=2 folds, is identified as RBP to the target IncRNA.\n\nthe\n\n[0032] In another aspect, the present invention further provides a proteomics method for defining a high-resolution spectrum of the interaction protein for the target IncRNA. By applying specific gRNA to different regions of the target IncRNA, the interaction protein of the specific region can be obtained.\n\n[0033] In another aspect, the present invention also pro- vides an analysis system (device) for determining IncRNA interaction proteins, which includes a data analysis unit configured to enrich and analyze the protein with more than one peptide detected by the present invention, and further analyze to determine the IncRNA interaction protein. Spe- cifically, the protein with more than one peptide includes human keratin. The specific analysis process comprises: normalizing and logarithmizing a LFQ abundance of each group; replacing a missing value by a minimum value representing the detection limits of mass spectrometer; determining the protein that is statistically enriched in samples of the gRNA transfection group compared to the control group transfected with gRNA empty vectors by ranl product; a protein with the adjusted p-values0.05 and the abundance changez2 folds, is identified as RBP to the target\n\nIncRNA.\n\n[0034] In some specific embodiments of the present inven- tion, CARPID is applied to three IncRNAs, namely XIST, DANCR and MALAT1, in the present invention, and reli- ably recognizes their known interaction proteins. It is worth noting that these three groups of interaction proteins have almost no overlap, showing the strong specificity of the method of the present invention.\n\n[0035] Insome specific embodiments of the present inven- tion, the CARPID technology of the CRISPR auxiliary system of the present invention systematically detects the IncRNA XIST binding protein group in a non-crosslinking manner. Using CARPID, the present invention not only detects a number of previously reported XIST binding proteins, but also identifies many new factors, among which the present invention validates the TAF15 and SNF2L in this study through biochemical and functional verification. The data of the present invention supports the current consensus that XIST RNA regulates XCI by recruiting chromatin remodeling agents for chromosome condensation and iso- lating transcription mechanisms to further inhibit\n\ngenes.\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\n[0036] In order to maximize the credibility of the present invention and avoid false positive signals, the present inven- tion controls the changes at both the experimental and statistical levels. Firstly, a self-cleavable GFP fusion is used to monitor the expression of BASU enzyme in cells and minimize the reaction time required for effective biotin labeling. Secondly, a multi-site targeting strategy is adopted to specifically target three different loci on XIST, and new proteins identified with at least two gRNA pairs are further verified in the present invention. Thirdly, for each group of gRNA, at least three repeated CARPID experiments are repeated. In addition, a triple simulation control is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the enrichment.\n\n[0037] The present invention also proves that CARPID can be universally used to detect the bound proteome of IncRNA. The present invention specifically targets the other two IncRNA DANCR and MALAT1 with different length expression levels and subcellular localization. The dysregu- lations of DANCR and MALAT1 expression relate to a variety of malignant tumors, including liver cancer, breast cancer, glioma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and lung cancer. The research of the present invention shows that DANCR can interact with proteins largely enriched in extracellular exosomes. Interestingly, it has been reported in various studies that serum DANCR levels are elevated in cancer patients. In addition, the present invention also identifies the interaction between DANCR and Ezrin (an important structural protein in the cell cortex). Such findings reveal the new function of IncRNA in tumor development.\n\n[0038] Label-free mass spectrometry is a direct and cost- effective method to apply CARPID. In addition, it has low technical requirements, thus ensuring wide applicability. The present invention has shown that CARPID is a powerful method for detecting RNA binding proteins, with high specificity and reproducibility. To further improve the reso- lution, quantitative mass spectrometry with different label- ing strategies (such as TMT and other isobaric chemical labeling and SILAC labeling) can be incorporated into the CARPID channel.\n\n[0039] In summary, the present invention combines CARPID, labeled quantitative mass spectrometry and non- parametric enrichment analysis, and can identify specific IncRNA interaction proteins in living cells with high con- fidence by using proteomics methods. The CARPID tech- nology of the present invention can draw a high-resolution spectrum of various IncRNAs interaction proteins involved in human diseases. Such spectrum can provide guidance for therapies that interfere with the function of specific IncR- NAs.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n[0040] The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.

The experi- mental methods without specifying specific conditions in the examples are conventional means and conventional condi- tions well known in the art, or according to the conditions recommended by the manufacturer.\n\nExample 1. Establishment of CARPID Technology\n\n[0100] Referring to FIG. 1a, the present invention pro- vides a method called CRISPR-assisted RNA-protein inter- action detection (CARPID), which can be used to detect RBP bound to endogenous IncRNA transcripts in living cells. The present invention designs a guide RNA (gRNA) array, which is composed of two gRNA sequences separated by a 30 nt direct repeat (DR) to target two adjacent loci on same IncRNA transcript (FIG. 4a). In theory, this can improve targeting specificity, thereby reducing background noise.\n\n[0101] In order to identify the RBP that binds to the target IncRNA, dCasRx is fused with the engineered biotin ligase BASU in the present invention. In order to monitor and minimize the changes caused by the heterogeneous expres-\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\nSion of BASU\n\nbetween cells\uff0cBASU-dCasRx is\n\nenzymes cloned in reading frame with self-cleaving T2A peptide and eGFP cDNA (FIG. 46) in the present invention. In order to optimize the reaction conditions, various induction times are tried (FIG. 4c). The present invention also compares the enzymatic activity by reversing the order of BASU and dCasRx in the fusion protein, and no obvious difference is observed (FIG. 4c). The present invention selects BASU- dCasRx, and the cells are treated with 200 uM biotin for 15 minutes in the subsequent analysis, as the shortest but sufficient reaction time. By co-expressing BASU-dCasRx fusion protein with gRNA targeting specific regions of IncRNA (XIST), biotinylation is induced and then bioti- nylated proteins are enriched for mass spectrometry-medi- ated protein identification and quantification (FIG. 1a), so as to carry out the CARPID. No significant changes in gene expression are observed in cells overexpressing BASU- dCasRx and gRNA, confirming that CARPID does not change the physiological functions of transfected cells (FIG.\n\n4d).\n\nExample 2 Performance Evaluation of CARPID\n\n[0102] XIST is one of the most interesting and intensively researched mammalian IncRNA genes. It is located on the Jong (q) arm of the X chromosome in the human genome and. is only expressed in the inactive X chromosome (Xi) to regulate cis-XCI in differentiated female cells. Technical research has revealed a variety of XIST binding proteins in the art and gradually revealed potential molecular pathways. This example focuses on XIST to evaluate the performance of CARPID.\n\n[0103] HEK293T cells are transfected with a vector expressing BASU-dCasRx and three different gRNAs tar- geting different regions of XIST in the present invention (FIG. 14; see Table 1 for the three groups of gRNA).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nXIST Li-1 TGAAAAGACCTTGAAAACACCTGGTGTACC (SEQ ID No. 1)\n\nXIST L1-2 AGGAGGGGACAAATAAGAGGGGACAGAGGT (SEQ No. 2)\n\nXIST L2-1 TATGTGGAGAGGACCCTCCTTTTCTAGTGC (SEQ ID No. 3)\n\nXIST L2-2 AGTCTTATGGAGTGGGCACTCCCTGCTGGA (SEQ ID No. 4)\n\nXIST L3-1 AGTAGAGGGGTTCATGTATAATGGGTGGGA (SEQ No. 5)\n\nXIST L3-2 AGAAGGGGCTTTGGGTAGTCAGCATACTCA (SEQ No. 6)\n\nDANCR L1-1 TAAGAGACGAACTCCTGGAGCTCAAGGTCG (SEQ ID No. 7}\n\nDANCR L1-2 GCTGCCTCAGTTCTTAGCGCAGGTTGACAA (SEQ No. 8}\n\nDANCR L2-1 TTCCTATTGTAACTGAAGGGATAGTTGGCT (SEQ No. 9)\n\nDANCR L2-2 CCAAATATGCGTACTAACTTGTAGCAACCA (SEQ ID No. 10)\n\nID\n\nID\n\nID\n\nID\n\nID\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\nTABLE 1-continued\n\nMALAT1 L1-1 AGTTGCGGGGCCCCAGTCCTTTACAGAAGT (SEQ ID No. 11) MALAT1 L1-2 TICTGCGTTGCTAAAATGGCGCTGCGCTTA (SEQ ID No. 12) MALAT1 L2-1 AATCTTAGAAACGTGAAAACCCACTCTTGG (SEQ ID No. 13) MALAT1 L2-2 TTGCTTTTTTGTTCGAGAAATCGGAGCAGC (SEQ ID No. 14)\n\n[0104] \u2018The specificity of these gRNA groups is confirmed co-transfection with active CasRx, the CasRx co-trans- fection shows that the target area is specifically digested without affecting other areas (FIG. 4e). Due to the highly ordered structure of XIST, the present invention also avoids targeting the expected XRNA hairpin structure (FIG. 5).\n\nby\n\n[0105] Three biological repetitions for each group o: gRNA are performed in the present invention to further \u201cdilute\u201d the non-specific noise generated by random bind- ing. To determine the baseline of background biotinylation, an empty gRNA vector is used in the present invention to perform a control CARPID. The protein identification base: on mass spectrometry (MS) shows that most of the detecte proteins with at least two peptides (447 proteins) are shared between different gRNA groups and in triplicate of each group, which indicates that CARPID has strong repeatability (FIG. 6a, FIG. 66).\n\n[0106] For the enrichment analysis, label-free MS quan- titation and non-parametric rank product test are applied in the present invention, the enrichment cut-off value is >2 times, and the adjusted p value is <0.05. The results show that at least one group of gRNA significantly enriched in 73 XIST interaction proteins compared with the vector control group (FIG. 1c). In addition, 23 of the 73 proteins are found to have at least two different groups of gRNAs, and 13 of which are shared by all three gRNA pairs (FIG. 1d; FIG. 6c). Previous studies have reported more than a quarter (19/73) of these strong XIST interaction proteins (FIG. 1d), includ- ing a variety of functionally verified conjugates: Cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC1A, an ATP-dependent helicase ATRX, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling agent BRG1. It is also noted in the present invention that some known XIST interactive RBPs, such as SPEN and RBM15, are not in this list. The inventors believe that their binding to XIST may be weak or dynamic in living cells, and are difficult to enrich.\n\n[0107] Gene ontology (GO) analysis of significantly enriched candidate proteins shows that the proteins inter- acting with XIST are largely involved in covalent chromatin modification and chromatin remodeling (FIG. le). The ATP- dependent helicase ATRX found in CARPID belongs to these categories. This gene is also reported in an indepen- dent study, asserting that it played a role in guiding the polycomb complex PRC2 to the X chromosome for inacti- vation and gene silencing. These findings of the present invention strongly indicate that CARPID is a highly reliable method for determining RBP.\n\n[0108] In addition to the known XIST interactors\uff0c CARPID has also identified a variety of new factors, includ- ing the transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit TAF 15 (FIG. Tc FIG. 1d). TAF15 is known to interact with TATA- box binding protein (TBP) and RNA polymerase II, and act as a co-activator that recognizes the core promoter and promotes transcription initiation. The present invention\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\nfirstly confirms the association between TAF15 and XIST\n\nIncRNA by Western blotting (WB) and immune FISH (FIG. 2a, FIG. 7). It is reported that TAF15 is an RNA binding protein in mouse tissues. Therefore, the present invention re-studies the TAF15 CLIP-seq data in the mouse brain, and ound that TAF15 does significantly bind to XIST IncRNA, and the binding cluster enrichment degree exceeded the expected 9 times (FIG. 26, FIG. 2c). In order to study whether the binding of TAF15 depends on its biochemical binding affinity to XIST IncRNA sequence characteristics, a library containing 40-nt RNA transcripts and random sequences is used in the present invention to perform HTR-SELEX experiments on TAF15 (FIG. 8a, FIG. 84). HTR-SELEX identified significant enrichment of RNA sequence motifs of TAF15 (FIG. 8c), similar to previous reports. Given that the abundant hairpin structure in XIST IncRNA may lead to dinucleotide interdependence, the effect of RNA sequence on TAF 15 binding cannot be fully described by a simple position weight matrix model. There- ore, a k-mer-based machine learning algorithm (gkm-SVM) is used in the present invention, and HTR-SELEX data is used to model the RNA binding specificity of the human TAF15 protein (FIG. 8d). Consistent with the WB and MS results, the HTR-SELEX results further support that the affinity of locus 1 and 2 where TAF15 binds to XIST\n\nIncRNA is higher than\n\nlocus 3 (FIG. 2e).\n\n[0109] The well-studied chromatin remodeling agent SNF2L is also found in CARPID (FIG. 1c), and confirmed by WB and immune FISH (FIG. 20. Consistently, the RIP-gPCR results shows that XIST IncRNA is significantly correlated with SNF2L (FIG. 2g). SNF2L and SNF2H are two collateral ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes belonging to the ISWI (Imitation Switch) family, which can move nucleosomes along DNA. For more than ten years, IWSI has been known to be associated with cohesin complexes in human cells. Consistent with this, the present invention identified two cohesin subunits SMC1A and RAD21 that interact with XIST (FIG. 1c).\n\n[0110]\n\nIn order to verify the role of these two new RBPs\n\nin mammalian XCI, a transgene female mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line with Xi-linked GFP reporter gene is used. in the present invention. Xi-linked GFP is silenced by multiple epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, no GFP tran- script is detected (FIG. 2/) and no fluorescent signal is observed (FIG. 9a). In contrast, when 5'-azacytosine (5-aza) is used to inhibit DNA methylation, both GFP mRNA and fluorescence signal increased significantly. In order to clarify their functional importance in XCI, TAF15 and SNF2L are depleted in the presence of 5-aza processing in the present invention (FIG. 94). Surprisingly, after silencing TAF15, the level of 5-aza-enhanced GFP is significantly reduced, which can be partially rescued by ectopic expres- sion of RNAi-resistant TAF 15 cDNA (FIG. 9c, FIG. 9d). In order to rule out the possibility that TAF15-related XCI is specific to the knocked-in GFP locus, RNA sequencing is performed in the present invention after the exhaustion of TAF15 in the female mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line under the genetic background of MAF and Cast hybrid. The allelic expression of a gene can be determined by the availability of SNPs between two different genetic back- grounds. As expected, the genes on the X chromosome show greater allelic depletion than autosomal genes (FIG. 9e), which the role of TAF15 in XCI. On the\n\nproves antagonizing other hand, in 5-aza-treated cells, knockdown of SNF2L\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\nresulted in further suppression of GFP (FIG. 2h, FIG. 9a), indicating that SNF2L and XIST RNA act synergistically promote XCI.\n\n[0111] Functionally, SNF2L and TAF15 belong to tran- scription repressor and activator, respectively. The present invention found that SNF2L is used as XIST RBP, indicating that ISWI family proteins may promote XCI through their known function of regulating the higher-order structure of chromatin. The binding of TAF15 and XIST indicates that XIST RNA can repel TAF15 and possibly other transcrip- tional activators from binding to the promoter of Xi-linked. genes, thereby preventing the expression of target genes. This phenomenon supports a multitasking model that recruits inhibitors (such as SNF2L) and expulsion transcrip- tion activators (such as TAF15), and they may be the basis of XIST-mediated X chromosome inactivation (FIG. 9f).\n\nExample 3. Application of CARPID\n\nIn order to generalize the application of CARPID\n\n[0112]\n\nand extend its application to non-nuclear IncRNAs, the present invention designs a gRNA set with respect to two other IncRNAs DANCR (differentiation antagonistic non- protein coding RNA) and MALATI (lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 associated with metastasis). It is reported that DANCR transcripts mainly exist in the cytoplasm, and their overexpression is significantly related to the poor prognosis of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and osteosarcoma. However, the molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. It is important to note that the length of DANCR is 1000 nucleotides, which is much shorter than XIST. This and its low abundance in cells (FIG. 10a) make it technically challenging to conduct research using currently available methods (such as ChIRP- MS), which requires spanning dozens of different RNA\n\nprobes in order to sufficiently capture.\n\n[0113] CARPID is used together with two sets of gRNA in HEK293T cells (FIG. 10), and the present invention detects 640 DANCR IncRNA-related proteins (22 peptides), of which 35 and 26 proteins are significantly enriched in the locus 1 and locus 2 (FIG. 3a, FIG. 34, FIG. 10c).\n\nIt is worth noting that GO-term analysis shows that\n\n[0114]\n\nmost DANCR-related proteins are rich in extracellular vesicles, which indicates that DANCR is located in this specialized cell compartment (FIG. 10d). To verify this, the present invention purifies vesicles from HEK293T cells and checks the total RNA of exosomes and whole cell lysates (FIG. 11a, FIG. 115). Indeed, quantitative RT-PCR analysis shows that the degree of enrichment of DANCR in exo- somes is 5 times that of cell lysates (FIG. 11c). In contrast, XIST is largely consumed in exosomes (FIG. 11d). The present invention also notes an interesting DANCR binding protein Ezrin (EZR) (FIG. 10d), a membrane-bound cyto- skeleton junction protein, which is associated with the poor prognosis of many cancers. RIP-qPCR verified the binding of Ezrin to DANCR IncRNA. Compared with the IgG control, DANCR IncRNA is approximately 2 times enriched in the Ezrin drop-down list, but it is not used for MALAT1\n\nIncRNA (FIG. 12a).\n\n[0115] CARPID is also performed in the present invention on another IncRNA MALAT that is known to be abundant in the nucleus but also present in the cytoplasm. Two groups of different gRNAs used for human MALAT1 can capture 484 proteins (22 peptides), of which 43 proteins are signifi- cantly enriched (FIG. 3c, FIG. 3d, FIG. 124).\n\nto\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\n[0116] In this study, among the three tested IncRNAs, the comparison results of CARPID that partially share the subcellular distribution results in the candidates with almost no overlap, demonstrating the high specificity of the\n\nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n<160> NUMBER OF SEQ ID NOS: 14\n\n<210>\n\nSEQ\n\nID\n\nNO\n\n1\n\n<211> LENGTH: 30 <212> TYPE: DNA <213> ORGANISM: Artificial Sequence <220> FEATURE: <223> OTHER INFORMATION: gRNA\n\n<400> SEQUENCE: 1\n\ntgaaaagace ttgaaaacac ctggtgtacc\n\n<210>\n\nID\n\nNO\n\n2\n\nSEQ <211> LENGTH: 30 <212> TYPE: DNA <213> ORGANISM: Artificial Sequence <220> FEATURE: <223> OTHER INFORMATION: gRNA\n\n<400> SEQUENCE:\n\n2\n\naggaggggac aaataagagg ggacagaggt\n\n<210>\n\nSEQ\n\nID\n\nNO\n\n3\n\n<211> LENGTH: 30 <212> TYPE: DNA <213> ORGANISM: Artificial Sequence <220> FEATURE: <223> OTHER INFORMATION: gRNA\n\n<400> SEQUENCE: 3\n\ntatgtggaga ggaccctcct tttctagtge\n\n<210> SEQ ID NO 4 <211> LENGTH: 30 <212> TYPE: DNA <213> ORGANISM: Artificial Sequence <220> FEATURE: <223> OTHER INFORMATION: gRNA\n\n<400> SEQUENCE: 4\n\nagtettatgg agtgggeact cectgetgga\n\n<210>\n\nID\n\nNO\n\n5\n\nSEQ <211> LENGTH: 30 <212> TYPE: DNA <213> ORGANISM: Artificial Sequence <220> FEATURE: <223> OTHER INFORMATION: gRNA\n\n<400> SEQUENCE: 5\n\nagtagagggg ttcatgtata atgggtggga\n\n<210> SEQ ID NO 6 <211> LENGTH: 30 <212> TYPE: DNA <213> ORGANISM: Artificial Sequence <220> FEATURE: <223> OTHER INFORMATION: gRNA\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\nCARPID method (FIG. 3e).
