As shown in FIG. 1, the electron gun 100 includes an electron emission element in the form of a filament 102. The filament 102 is connected to a power supply 104 and acts as a cathode during operation. The power supply 104 is arranged to heat and hence activate the filament 102 to trigger electron beam 50 emission from the filament 102. An electrode 106, with a through hole 106H that allows the electron beam 50 to pass, is arranged downstream of the filament 102 (relative to the emitted electron beam). The electrode 106 is electrically connected with a high potential terminal of another power supply 108 such that the electrode 106 acts as an anode during opera- tion. The electrode 106 provides an electric field that accel- erates the emitted electron beam 50 towards the electrode\n\nThe controller 230 may alternatively be implemented as an information handling system such as a computer. The information handling system may have different configura- tions, and it generally comprises suitable components nec- essary to receive, store, and execute appropriate computer instructions, commands, or codes. The main components of the information handling system are a processor and a memory 204. The processor may be formed by one or more CPU, MCU, controllers, logic circuits, Raspberry Pi chip, etc. The memory 204 may include one or more volatile memory unit (such as RAM, DRAM, SRAM), one or more non-volatile unit (such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FRAM, MRAM, FLASH, SSD, NAND, and NVDIMM), or of their combinations.\n\n(schematically represented) is arranged between the filament 102 and the electrode 106. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 is connected with a control circuit 200, which in turn connects to a low potential terminal of the power supply 108. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 is arranged at an electric potential to provide an electric field to control emission of electron beams 50 from the filament 102. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 has a lower potential relative to the filament 102. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 generates an electric field to control the electron emission area of the filament 102 and to control the size or focus of the electron beam 50. The electric potential of the Wehnelt cylinder 110 (hence the electric field produced by the Wehnelt cylinder 110) can be changed by the control circuit 200 to change the electron emission area of the filament 102 and to change the size or focus of the electron beam 50. For example, the convergence or diver- gence of the emitted electron beam 50 can be controlled for different applications (e.g., for electron microscopy, for diffraction, etc.). A potential difference across the control circuit 200, i.e., the potential difference between the Wehnelt cylinder 110 and the filament 102, can be referred to as a bias\n\nIt will also be appreciated that where the methods and systems of the invention are either wholly implemented by computing system or partly implemented by computing systems then any appropriate computing system architecture may be utilized. This will include stand-alone computers, network computers, dedicated or non-dedicated hardware devices.

The described embodiments of the invention should therefore be considered in all respects as illustrative, not restrictive.\n\nIn this embodiment, the high and low potential terminals of the power supply 104 are connected across the filament 102. The low potential terminal of the power supply 104 and the low potential terminal of the power supply 108 are directly connected with each other such that any circuit nodes directly between them (including one side of the control circuit 200) are at the same potential. The high potential terminal of the power supply 108 is connected to ground.\n\nand the control element can be of different form, size, shape, and construction. The electron emission element can be activated by various means, e.g., electric field or heat (or both), to emit electron beams. The electron emission ele- ment, the electrode, and the control element can take any potential or voltage values so long as the potential of the control element is more negative than the potential of the electron emission element and the potential of the electrode is more positive than the potential of the electron emission element. The control circuit can include various means for adjusting the electric potential for the control element, including the variable resistance circuit illustrated. The variable resistance circuit can be constructed using different electronic components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches, etc.) arranged in a different electrical connections. The resistors need not be connected only in series. The number of resistors can be changed. A variable resistor may be used in addition to or in place of the resistor-and-photo- relay unit. The control of the control circuit by the user through actuator that receives a user input or by a detector\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates the control circuit 200 of the electron gun 100. The control circuit 200 includes five resistors 202-210 connected in series. The first resistor 202 includes a resistance R' the second resistor 204 includes a resistance R, the third resistor 206 includes a resistance 2R, the fourth resistor 208 includes a resistance 4R, and the fifth resistor 210 includes a resistance 8R. The second to fourth resistors 204-210 are each respective connected with a respective switch 214-220 in the form of a photo-relay. The photo- relays are connected to a controller 230, which indepen- dently control the on/off of each of the switches 214-220, to adjust an equivalent resistance across the nodes A and B. The resulting equivalent resistances at different configurations (different on/off of the switches 214-220) are shown in FIG. 3. The change in equivalent resistance would then affect the bias voltage hence the electric potential of the Wehnelt\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n1.
