For example, flexible electronics may be used in wearable electronic device components and devices (i.e. wearable electronics), which may include smart fabric materials in the wearable electronics. Preferably, devices including garments made with smart fabrics may be used ina variety of applications such as healthcare to replace bulky instruments and bulky electronic components.\n\n[0105] FIG. 21C is a plot of capacity retention against bending cycles of the AD-battery 1400 being bent at 180\u00b0.\n\n[0106] FIG. 22A is a plot of voltage against specific capacity showing GCD curves of the AD-battery 1400 being immersed in water for different period of time.\n\n[0107] FIG. 22B is a plot of capacity retention against soaking time of the AD-battery 1400 being immersed in solution of blue ink.\n\n[0125] One example of an energy storage device for flexible/wearable electronics is zinc-ion battery (ZIB) which may include advantages such as having much less toxic and. flammable materials therein as compared with lithium-ion batteries, therefore may have much less safety and/or health concern to users. ZIB may also be low cost for scaling up as a result of the water-free and/or oxygen-free environment for assembling the battery. In addition, ZIB may have a high specific capacity as a result of multiple electron transfer and a low redox potential of Zn?*/Zn.\n\n[0108] FIG. 22C is a plot of capacity retention against soaking time of the AD-battery 1400 being immersed in solution of beer, soda or redberry juice.\n\n[0109] FIG. 23A is an optical image showing the AD- battery 1400 being sealed in an ice while powering a digital timer.\n\n[0110] FIG. 23B is a plot of capacity retention against storage time of the AD-battery 1400 working at -20\u00b0 C. The insert is a plot of voltage against specific capacity showing discharge curves of the AD-battery 1400 at different time intervals corresponding to FIG. 23B.\n\n[0126] It is appreciated that nowadays many of the flexible and wearable devices may be used in various harsh envi- ronments.

Preferably, the hydrogel may be encapsulated by a polymeric layer that forms at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel. The polymeric layer may prevent water from escaping from the hydrogel structure, allowing the device being operable under the aforementioned harsh conditions.\n\n[0132] With reference to FIG. 1A, there is shown an exemplary embodiment of an electrical energy storage device 100. The electrical energy storage device 100 may be of any form that can capture energy produced at one time for use at a later time. In one example, the device 100 may be a battery. In another example, the device 100 may be a supercapacitor. In this exemplary embodiment, the electrical energy storage device 100 is a battery, particularly a rechargeable battery. The battery 100 may be of any suitable form that fits a particular application, such as flat-shaped, fiber-shaped, twisted fiber-shaped, coin-shaped, ball-shaped etc. Regardless of the shape of the battery, the battery may substantially have a high resistance to water loss upon subjecting to a dehydration process such as freeze-dry, boiling, and the like. The battery may also be substantially resistant to external mechanical force while the electro- of the is maintained.\n\n[0127] The inventors have, through their own research, trials, and experiments, devised that the failure of the electrical energy storage devices may be correlated to the stability of the electrolyte. It is appreciated that hydrogel electrolytes have been used various flexible and wearable electrical energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the inven- tors found that many of the hydrogel electrolytes suffer from failure as a result of the loss of water content from the electrolytes.\n\n[0128] For example, water may evaporate from the elec- trolyte when the device is operated at a high temperature. Even switching to an ambient condition may reduce the evaporation rate of water, the water content of the electrolyte may eventually become zero in long run. In contrast, when the device operates at subzero temperatures, water may easily turn into ice and swell in the hydrogel electrolyte thereby inhibiting ion transportation across the electrolyte. Besides, when the hydrogel electrolyte is operated under water, it may absorb water and swell, resulting in loss of adhesion between electrodes and electrolyte. In addition, the exchange of solute between the electrolyte and water may decrease ion concentration of the electrolyte and therefore lower the electrochemical performance of the device even- tually.\n\n[0133] In this embodiment, the battery 100 comprises an electrode 102 and an electrode 104 being spaced apart from each other and an electrolyte 106 disposed between the electrodes 102, 104. The electrolyte 106 is sandwiched between and is electrically coupled with the electrodes 102, 104. The electrodes 102, 104 may function as an anode and a cathode, respectively or vice versa.\n\n[0134] Optionally or additionally, the battery 100 may also include substrates 108, 110 which may provide mechanical supports to the electrode 102 and/or the electrode 104. The substrates may also operate as a current collector to asso- ciate with the electrodes 102, 104, respectively. For example, the substrates may be electrically conductive and may be bonded to external electrical wires to deliver elec- trical energy to external electronic devices.\n\n[0129] Besides, human bodies and organs are soft, curved, and constantly moving, flexible and wearable devices will therefore experience various mechanical forces during rou- tine use, including forces from, for example, stretching, folding, hitting, shearing etc. The device sometimes may even experience accidentally cutting and/or scratching dur- ing use. In other words, it is inevitable for the device to experience different deformation and/or damages during routine usage or long-term usage. Furthermore, one desir- able feature of a flexible/wearable electronic device may be weather resistant. That is, the device may be operated under harsh environments. For example, it may be desirable for a smart watch being operable under water during diving or being operable in a cold environment with a temperature of ice or even lower.\n\n[0135] The battery 100 may optionally or additionally include an encapsulating layer 112 that receives and encases the electrodes 102, 104 and the electrolyte 106. The encap- sulating layer 112 may be formed in any suitable shape such as for example a cylinder or a planar shape or any other suitable shape. The encapsulating layer 112 may be formed from a suitable material such as epoxy or a polymer. Preferably, the encapsulating layer 112 may be capable of preventing water from escaping from the battery.\n\n[0130] Accordingly, it may be preferable to provide a hydrogel electrolyte that is capable of retaining its water content under extreme temperature as well as maintaining its mechanical properties under such temperature. It may also be preferable to provide an electrical energy storage device containing said electrolyte such that the device may be operable with stable electrochemical performance under various harsh conditions such as mechanical deformations, and even under ice or boiling water.\n\n[0136] In one example embodiment, the electrode 102 functions as an anode and the electrode 104 functions as a cathode of the battery 100. In operation there is a charge transfer between the anode 102 and the cathode 104 in order to convert chemical energy to electrical energy. The anode 102 and the cathode 104 are preferably being flexible. The anode 102 and cathode 104 are arranged in a suitable arrangement depending on the desired shape of the battery 100.\n\n[0131] In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an electrical energy storage device that may be operable with stable electro- chemical performance under various harsh conditions such as under ice or boiling water. The device may also be capable of physically deforming upon subjecting to an external mechanical load such as folding, rolling, twisting, and the like.

The substrate 108 may be of any suitable material. In one example the substrate 108 is a stainless steel (SS) mesh.

In one example, the encapsulation may be a polymer matrix having the same composition as the electrolyte 106. For example, the encap- sulation may have the same polymeric materials and elec- trolytic solution that constitute the electrolyte 106. That is, each of the anode and cathode is enclosed by a separate encapsulation 130 having the same composition as the electrolyte 106. Alternatively, the anode and the cathode may be directly enclosed in the electrolyte 106. In other words, the anode and the cathode are positioned within the electrolyte 106.\n\nsheet. The substrate 108 may have some electrical conduc- tance but is preferably robust enough to function within an electrolyte.\n\n[0138] The anode 102 preferably comprises zinc. In one example, the anode may be a zinc sheet, particularly a zinc nanosheet 114 that is electrodeposited onto SS mesh 108. The SS mesh 108 provides a base layer for the zinc to be deposited onto. The SS mesh 108 may also have a rough surface which in turn facilitating the deposition of materials thereon. The zinc is deposited to form a substantially thick layer of zinc 114. The thickness may depend on the opera- tional life of the battery 100.\n\n[0139] In one example, the electrodeposited zinc may be highly crystalline and uniformly cover the entire surface of the SS mesh. In particular, the electrodeposited zinc may have a highly porous architecture comprising interconnected nanosheets. For example, the nanosheets may be uniformly and vertically arranged on the SS mesh forming a laminated structure. This may be advantageous as the nanocrystalline and porous structure may reduce ion diffusion path which in turn facilitating electrolyte penetration as well as charge/ion transport.\n\n[0146] In yet another example, the encapsulation 130 may not have the same composition as the electrolyte 106. That for example, the encapsulation 130 may have the same electrolytic solution as the electrolyte 106 but different polymeric materials.\n\n[0147] The electrolyte 106 may be a polymeric electrolyte disposed between or containing the anode 102 and the cathode 104. Preferably, the polymeric electrolyte 106 may bea hydrogel electrolyte that is viscous enough to be formed into a shape and retain the shape it is formed into. For example, the electrolyte 106 may be formed into any one of an elongated shape, a planar shape, a tubular shape, a ball shape or any suitable shape.\n\n[0148] The hydrogel electrolyte may comprise a polymer matrix including at least two crosslinked structures having at least two polymeric materials. The polymer material(s) may be chemically functionalized so as to form a covalent bond with the encapsulating layer 112, thereby the hydrogel electrolyte may be substantially encapsulated by the encap- sulating layer 112 and preventing water losing from the hydrogel.\n\n[0141] The cathode 104 comprises a substrate 110 with an active material 116 disposed on the substrate. In one example, the substrate 110 may be in similar construction to the anode substrate 108. That is, the substrate 110 comprises aSS mesh. Alternatively the substrate may be a CNT paper, carbon paper, carbon cloth, nickel/copper alloy cloth or steel sheet.\n\n[0149] The hydrogel electrolyte 106 may include an elec- trolytic solution containing an aqueous electrolytic solution particularly a salt solution containing at least one ion of Li*, Na*, Ca?*, Mg?*, Zn?*, AT, or Fe**. The concentration of ions in the salt solution may be of 0.1-3 M. In another example, the hydrogel electrolyte 106 may include an elec- trolytic solution containing at least one acid of H3PO,, H,CO;, CH;COOH or HF. The concentration of acids in the electrolytic solution may be of 0.1-3 M. A skilled person may recognize any other electrolytic solutions including suitable salts, ions or acids according to their needs.\n\n[0142] The active material 116 comprises a metal oxide or a metal oxide compound deposited on the substrate 110. In one example, the active material may be MnO, electrode- posited on the SS mesh. The MnO, may have a porous structure comprising a plurality of nanoflakes intercon- nected with each other. The nanoflakes may have a polycrys- talline structure comprising a plurality of nanograins with a size of, for example, approximately 10 nm. Similar to the nanocrystalline and porous structure formed by the elec- trodeposited zinc, the porous nanostructural architecture of the electrodeposited MnO, may reduce ion diffusion path which in turn facilitating electrolyte penetration as well as charge/ion transport.\n\n[0150] The electrolyte 106 may be flexible and may dis- sipate at least some mechanical energy when subjected to an external mechanical load applied to the battery 100, thereby allowing the battery 100 to maintain its electrochemical performance while under de \u2018ormation. For example, the battery 100 may physically deform into different irregular shapes under the conditions o bending, folding, squeezing, twisting, cutting, and hammering while dissipating energy therefrom, and maintaining mance. In other words, the e withstanding a certain amount the electrochemical perfor- lectrolyte may be capable of of mechanical forces applied thereto while the integrity of the electrolyte and thereby the battery is maintained.\n\n[0143] Alternatively, the cathode 104 may comprise other active materials such as LiMn,O, or polypyrrole deposited or electroplated onto substrate 110.\n\n[0144] In one example, each of the anode 102 and the cathode 104 may be enclosed by an encapsulation 130 (not shown). That is, the anode 102 and the cathode 104 may be in contact with the electrolyte 106 through the encapsulation 130. The encapsulation 130 on the one hand may function as an electrode protector by dissipating the energy applied thereonto. On the other hand, the encapsulation 130 may synergistically work with the electrolyte 106 so as to dissi- pating the energy applied on the battery 100, maintaining the integrity and durability of the battery.\n\n[0151] With reference to F IG. 1B, there is provided an alternative configuration of battery 100 (i.e. battery 100\u00b0). The battery 100' may have a similar configuration to the battery 100 in view of electrodes and electrolyte. The battery 100' may have an anode 102 and a cathode 104 being spaced apart from each other. Each of the electrodes 102, 104 may\n\n[0145] The encapsulation 130 may include a polymer or polymer matrix. The polymer or polymer matrix may have\n\n[0140] Alternatively the anode 102 may comprise a ribbon a sheet of zinc metal. That is, the anode 102 may not include an additional substrate 108 and may include a piece of zinc metal. The zinc metal may be a flexible ribbon or a flexible sheet of zinc metal. The zine metal is arranged in a suitable configuration based on the desired shape of the battery 100.\n\nor\n\nis,\n\nJan. 14 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0013551 A1\n\n7\n\nalso include a substrate 108 , 110 supporting the electrodes .\n\ncrosslinked structure .

The electrolyte 106 is sandwiched between the electrodes 102, 104.\n\n[0152] The battery 100' may include an encapsulation 130 enclosing the sandwiched structure (i.e. anode 102, electro- lyte 106, and cathode 104). In this example, the encapsula- tion 130 may include the same composition that constitutes the electrolyte 106. That is, the encapsulation 130 may have the same polymeric material(s) and electrolytic solution as the electrolyte 106. Under this arrangement, the electrodes 102, 104 are equivalent to be enclosed/wrapped by the electrolyte 106.\n\n[0160] The second crosslinked structure is defined by a plurality of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202 that form a chemical crosslink between each adjacent air of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202. The chemical crosslink may include at least one covalent ond that is formed in different ways. In one example, the chemical crosslink may include at least one covalent bond formed at a bonding site 204 between the adjacent pair o polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202.\n\n[0153] The battery 100' may also include an encapsulating layer 112 located at the outer surface of the battery. The encapsulating layer may be a polymeric layer such as an elastomeric layer encapsulating the battery. The elastomeric layer may form at least one crosslinked structure with the electrolyte 106 such that the elastomeric layer is directly coated on surface of the hydrogel electrolyte 106. In this example, the elastomeric layer 112 may form at least one crosslinked structure, such as a chemical crosslinked struc- ture with the encapsulation 130, which has the same com- position as the electrolyte 106, thereby encapsulating the 100'.\n\n[0161] For example, the chemical crosslink may include a first crosslinking agent 206, such as methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA) crosslinker, which forms at least one kind o covalent bonds with each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202 or PAAm. Preferably, the crosslinking agent may act as an anchor for bonding the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material together so as to strengthen the robust- ness of the structure. That is, the second crosslinked struc- ture comprises a plurality of polymer chains of the secon polymeric material covalently bonded together via the first 206.\n\n[0154] The elastomeric layer may function as a substan- tially blocking layer which reduces exchange of material between the electrolyte and an external environment. In other words, with the use of the elastomeric layer, on the one hand, the materials from the battery (e.g. water, ions, etc.) may be difficult to move to the external environment; and on the other hand, external materials may also be difficult to move into the battery. This blocking feature may be advan- tageous as the electrochemical performance of the battery may not be easily deteriorated owing to the loss of battery materials such as water or the entry of external materials that could cause damage to the battery structure during opera-\n\n[0162] The second crosslinked structure may be optionally or additionally defined by the plurality of polymer chains o the second polymeric material 202 that form a physica\u2019 crosslink between each adjacent pair of polymer chains o the second polymeric material 202. The physical crosslink may include at least one hydrogen bond that is formed at a bonding site 208 between the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202.\n\n[0163] In one example, the physical crosslink may include a second crosslinking agent 210 such as ethylene glycol (EG), which forms at least one hydrogen bond with each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202 or PAAm. The second crosslinking agent may provide additional linkages between each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material which may in turn further strengthen the second crosslinked structure.\n\n[0155] The detailed structural arrangement of the electro- lyte 106 will now be described. With reference to FIG. 2A, the electrolyte 106 comprises a hydrogel 200 and a poly- meric layer 201 forming at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel, thereby substantially encapsulating the hydrogel.\n\n[0156] In this example, the polymer layer may comprise a plurality of polymer chains of a first polymer material that form at least one covalent bond with the hydrogel, forming a first crosslinked structure with the hydrogel. The hydrogel 200 may comprise a polymer matrix including at least two crosslinked structures having a second polymeric material and a third polymeric material.\n\n[0164] The second crosslinking agent 210 may be arranged to provide an anti-freezing effect to the electrolyte 106. As shown in FIG. 2B, the second crosslinking agent may further form at least one hydrogen bond with water molecules. In other words, the water molecules are \u201cheld\u201d by the second crosslinking agent, rendering the water mol- ecules more distant from each other. As such, it would be more difficult for the water molecules to get close enough to crystallize (i.e. forming ice) under subzero temperatures, increasing the resistance of the electrolyte to freezing con- ditions.\n\n[0157] In particular, the first polymeric material and the second polymeric materials and/or the third polymeric mate- rial may be chemically functionalized such that the hydrogel 200 and the polymeric layer 201 may be chemically cross- linked with each other.\n\n[0158] In one example, the first polymeric material may be polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) forming an elastomeric layer. The second and the third polymeric material may be polyacrylamide (PAAm) and alginate respectively, which combine and form a hydrogel material that may have an interconnected porous structure and may be used as an electrolyte in a battery or a supercapacitor.\n\n[0165] Referring back to FIG. 2A, the third crosslinked structure of the polymer matrix 200 is defined by a plurality of polymer chains of the third polymeric material 212 that form an ionic crosslink between each adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material 212 or alginate. The ionic crosslink may include at least one ionic bond formed at a bonding site 214 between the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material 212.\n\n[0159] Referring to FIG. 2A, the polymer matrix 200 may include at least a second crosslinked structure and a third\n\nbattery\n\ntion.\n\ncrosslinking agent\n\nJan. 14 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0013551 A1\n\n8\n\n[ 0166 ] For example , the ionic crosslink may include a\n\ncoupling agent 224 , or the combination thereof .

These divalent and/or trivalent ions form at least one ionic bond with each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material 210 or alginate. In other words, the ionic bond formed between each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material 210 or alginate may include a single type of cation and/or a combination of different types of cation.\n\ncoupling agent 224, or the combination thereof. In one example, the polymer chains of the first polymeric material and the third polymeric material may be functionalized with the first coupling agent 222 and the second coupling agent 224, respectively. In another example, each of the polymer chains of the first and the third polymeric materials may be functionalized with both the first coupling agent 222 and the second coupling agent 224. In this example, the polymer chains of the first polymeric material 218 may be function- alized with the first coupling agent 222 while the polymer chains of the third polymeric material 202 may be function- alized with the second coupling agent 224.\n\n[0167] The third crosslinking agent 216 may, on the one hand, partially act as an anchor for bonding the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material together so as to strengthen the robustness of the structure. For example, the third crosslinking agent 216 may form at least one ionic bond with a specific functional group of the polymer chains of the second polymeric material. As shown in FIG. 2C, the third crosslinking agent may form two hydrogen bonds with the guluronic acid units of the polymer chains of the third polymeric material 210. On the other hand, the ionic bond- ing may reversibly break down upon receiving external mechanical load/stress applied to the polymer matrix, thereby dissipating the applied mechanical loads. The bond- ing may also reform rapidly which in turn allowing the crosslinked structure to reestablish quickly thereby mini- mizing any structural expansion when the electrolyte is operated under water. That is, the third crosslinked structure comprises a plurality of polymer chains of the third poly- meric material ionically bonded together via the third cross-\n\n[0173] The coupling agents may be of any suitable chemi- cal compounds that can provide at least one chemical bond. between two dissimilar materials. In particular, the coupling agents may be a silane-type coupling agent. The polymer chains of the first polymeric material may be functionalized with a first coupling agent of triethoxy(vinyl)silane (TEOVS); whereas the polymer chains of the third poly- meric material may be functionalized with the second cou- pling agent of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrlate (TMSPMA).\n\n[0174] At the bonding site 220, the first coupling agent 222 or TEOVS and the second coupling agent 224 or TMSPMA may be hydrolysed by any suitable method. The hydrolysed coupling agents 222, 224 may condensate with each other by forming a covalent bond such as a siloxane bond therebetween. As such, any molecules along the poly- mer chain of the first polymeric material and the third polymeric material functionalized with the coupling agents 222, 224 may form a covalent or siloxane bond therebe- tween, thereby allowing the polymeric layer coating on and encapsulating the hydrogel structure.\n\n[0168] Optionally or additionally, the covalently cross- inked structure may be crosslinked with the ionically cross- inked structure through physical interactions such as inter- twining and intercrossing between the polymer chains of the second polymeric material and the third polymeric material. By which the mechanical robustness of the hydrogel may be further increased.\n\n[0175] The hydrogel 200 is arranged to retain an electro- lytic solution therein for ion conductivity. The electrolytic solution may include at least one salt, in particular a metal salt, or an acid or an anti-freezing agent as additives within the electrolytic solution. In one example, the at least one salt, acid, anti-freezing agent may further function as a cross- linking agent for the covalent and/or ionic crosslinked structures. Preferably, the electrolytic solution may include zinc(II) sulphate (ZnSO,), manganese(II) sulphate (MnO,), Li,SO, and/or H,PO,. A skilled person may recognize any other electrolytic solutions including suitable salts or acids according to their needs.\n\n[0169] The polymeric layer 201 may comprise a plurality of polymer chains of the first polymeric material 218 or PDMS forming at least one covalent and/or physical cross- ink defining a chemical and/or physical crosslinked struc- ture. For example, the molecules of each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the first polymeric material may be chemically crosslinked by one or more covalent bonds ormed directly between molecules in each of the polymer chains of the first polymeric material 218.\n\n[0176] Referring to FIG. 2A, there is shown an example structure of electrolyte 106 illustrating the crosslinked struc- tures within the electrolyte. As mentioned above, the elec- trolyte 106 comprises a hydrogel including a polymer matrix having at least two crosslinked structures. The electrolyte also comprises a polymeric layer forming at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel such that the hydro- gel is substantially encapsulated by the polymeric layer.\n\n[0170] Additionally, the polymer chains of the first poly- meric material 218 may be physically crosslinked with each other by intertwining as well as intercrossing with each other, forming an additionally physically crosslinked struc- ture.\n\n[0171] As mentioned above, the polymeric layer 201 may form at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel 200 so as to substantially encapsulating the hydrogel. With reference to FIG, 2A, the polymeric layer and the hydrogel may form at least a first crosslinked structure defined by the plurality of polymer chains of the first polymeric material and the third polymeric material forming at least one cova- lent bond at a bonding site 220 between the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the first and the third polymeric materials 218, 202.\n\n[0177] In this example, the polymeric layer is an elasto- meric layer comprising PDMS (i.e. the first polymeric material). The PDMS chains is arranged to form at least one covalent bond with the hydrogel, forming a first crosslinked structure. The hydrogel includes a polymer matrix having a second crosslinked structure and a third crosslinked struc- ture. Each of the crosslinked structures are defined by a plurality of polymer chains of polyacrylamide (PAAm) (i.e. the second polymeric material) or alginate (i.e. the third polymeric material).

The second crosslinked structure includes a plurality of PAAm chains crosslinked together by forming covalent bonds with a crosslinking agent such as N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA) at a particular bonding site. In particular, the bonding site is where the reaction of the amide group of the PAAm chains and the amide groups of MBAA to occur.

It may be the step of forming an anode. In one example, the anode may be a zinc anode. The zine anode may be prepared by electrodepositing zinc metal onto a substrate. Preferably, the substrate is a SS mesh. Alterna- tively, the substrate may be selected from carbon cloth, carbon nanotube (CNT) paper, carbon paper, nickel/copper alloy cloth or steel sheet. The electrodeposition time may depend on the thickness requirement, which may depend on the operational life of the electrical energy storage device.\n\n[0178] The second crosslinked structure also includes a plurality of PAAm chains crosslinked together by forming hydrogen bonds with a crosslinking agent such as ethylene glycol (EG) at a particular bonding site as shown in FIG. 2B. The bonding site is where the interaction between the amide group of the PAAm chains and hydroxyl group of the EG to occur. The EG may further interact with water molecules by forming at least one hydrogen bond with the water mol- ecules. As such, the water molecules are kept apart from each other and prevented from crystallization (i.e. forming ice) when the electrolyte is subjected to subzero tempera- tures.\n\n[0184] The electrodeposition may be performed by any suitable methods.

An aqueous solution containing for example 1 mol L7! of ZnSO, and 1 mol L7! KCI (AR grade, Sigma) may be used as the electrolyte. The electroplating may be performed at a predetermined current density (e.g. 10 mA cm for a predetermined time (e.g. 1 h) using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D).\n\n[0179] The third crosslinked structure includes a plurality of alginate chains crosslinked together by forming ionic bonds with ionic crosslinking agents such as Zn2+ and/or Mna2+ in the electrolyte. The ionic bonds form when alginate is immersed in an electrolytic solution. Preferably, as shown in FIG. 2C, the bonding site is where the interaction between the guluronic acid units in different alginate chains and the ionic crosslinking agents such as Zn** and/or Mn** to occur, in which the negatively charged carboxyl group of the dissociated acid unit in each of the alginate chain forms ionic bonds with the cation. In addition, as alginate includes multiple guluronic acid units, therefore multiple alginate chains may be crosslinked together with such ionic linkages formed by the cations and the carboxy] groups in each of the alginate chains.\n\n[0185] In another example, the anode may be a conductive polymer deposited on a substrate. In particular, the anode may be a conductive polymer of polypyrrole (PPy) elec- trodeposited on a SS CNT paper. Alternatively, the PPy may be electrodeposited on carbon cloth carbon paper, nickel/ copper alloy cloth, steel sheet, and the like. The electrode- position may be carried out in an electrochemical setup containing a solution of 0.1 M p-toluenesulfonic acid (AR, Aladdin), 0.3 M sodium toluenesulfate (AR, Sigma-Al- drich), and 0.5% pyrrole monomer (AR, Sigma-Aldrich). The electrodeposition may be performed at a predetermined voltage (e.g. 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl) for a predetermined time (e.g. 10 min) at 0\u00b0 C.\n\n[0180] The ionic bonds may act as a reversible crosslink- ing point that can dynamically break/rupture and reform/ restore to dissipate mechanical energy upon subjecting to external mechanical loads. The rapid reformation or resto- ration of the ruptured bonds may further minimize the structural expansion of the electrolyte when it is operated under water.\n\n[0181] The polymeric layer comprises a plurality of PDMS chains 218. The PDMS chains may directly form one or more covalent bond between the silane molecules of adjacent PDMS chains, forming a chemically crosslinked structure. The PDMS chains may also intertwine and inter- cross with each other to form a physically crosslinked network.\n\n[0186] In the step of forming a cathode, it may include the step of electrodepositing an active material onto a substrate.

In one example, the aqueous electrolytic solution may include at least one of a salt, an acid or a surfactant additives.\n\n[0188] In another example, the cathode may be a cathode in which the active material PPy is electrodeposited onto a CNT paper using the same procedure as the PPy anode.\n\n[0197] In this example, the cured hydrogel may be soaked into an aqueous electrolytic solution containing zinc(II) sulphate at a concentration of for example 2 mol L7' and manganese(II) sulphate at a concentration of for example 0.2 mol L7*, 30 wt % of EG, and 0.1 mol L~' of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (i.e. surfactant) for 1 h at room temperature. This may allow ion exchange between the internal of hydrogel and the external solution. In addition, the ionic crosslinks may form between adjacent alginate chains through the interactions with Zna+ and/or Mn?* ions. Also, any excess Zn?* and/or Mn?* ions may contribute to ion transport for the electrolyte. Furthermore, the surfactant may facilitate the solvation and hydrolysis of the coupling agents in the interfacial layer of the aforementioned hydrogel 200 and the polymeric layer 201, thereby facilitating the cou- pling reaction therebetween.\n\n[0189] In yet another example, the cathode may be a LiMn,0, (LMO) cathode. The active material LMO may be deposited on a substrate such as SS mesh. In particular, the LMO may form a slurry with a conductive material and a binder under a predetermined weight ratio with an aid of a solvent. In this example, the solvent, the conductive mate- rial, and the binder may be acetone, acetylene blacks, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), respectively. The slurry may be uniformly deposited onto the SS mesh using a blade.\n\n[0190] It is appreciated that the steps of forming the anode and the cathode may be reversed (i.e. forming the cathode prior to forming the anode) or may be performed simulta- neously.\n\n[0191] The steps of forming the anode and the cathode may further include the step of encapsulating the anode and the cathode with an electrolyte. The electrolyte, particularly a hydrogel electrolyte comprising a polymer matrix may be prepared by forming a mixture of a first gel monomer, an initiator, a first crosslinking agent, a second crosslinking agent, and a first coupling agent. In this example, the polymer matrix is a matrix of PAAm and alginate. The first gel monomer is acrylamide, the initiator is ammonium persulfate, the first crosslinking agent is N,N'-methylenebi- sacrylamide (MBAA), the second crosslinking agent is ethylene glycol (EG), and the first coupling agent is 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrlate (TMSPMA).\n\n[0199] Turning back to the step of encapsulating the anode and the cathode with the electrolyte. The anode and the cathode may be encapsulated by the electrolyte separately by immersing the anode or the cathode into the blend as mentioned above, followed by the step of curing the blend at room temperature or a higher temperature and soaking the cured blend in an aqueous electrolytic solution. As such, each of the anode and the cathode would be encapsulated by an electrolyte, forming an encapsulated anode and an encap- sulated cathode.\n\n[0192] Preferably, the mixture is formed by dissolving 3 g of acrylamide monomer (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) into 20 mL 30% EG solution. The solution is then added with 14.3 mg of ammonium persulphate (APS, >98%, Acros Organics) and 0.16 mL of 0.1 mol L-' MBAA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich). After that, 76 wl of TMSPMA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich 440159) is added to the mixture under vigorously stirring. The mixture may then be added with an alginate (i.e.\n\n[0200] The encapsulated anode and the encapsulated cath- ode may then sandwich the electrolyte by depositing the encapsulated anode and the encapsulated cathode onto the opposite sides of the electrolyte, forming a sandwiched structure with the anode and the cathode being wrapped inside the electrolyte.\n\n[0193] second polymeric material) to form a blend. The blend may be degassed to remove any air bubbles therein, facilitating the subsequent curing process. In this example, 0.358g of alginate (AR grade, Sigma-Aldrich) is added to the mixture under stirring until a clear blend solution is obtained. The solution may be degassed for 10 min by ultrasonication.\n\n[0201] Alternatively, the step of encapsulating the anode and the cathode may be performed simultaneously with the step of forming the electrolyte. In turn, the anode and the cathode would be encapsulated and wrapped inside the electrolyte upon the step of curing the blend.\n\n[0194] The as-obtained blend may be cured to form a hydrogel. The curing process may be performed at room temperature or a higher temperature to allow polymeriza- tion. The curing process may be carried in a glass mould. In this example, the degassed blend may be cured in a planar or column mold under UV radiation (360 nm) at room temperature for 2h in order to allow free radical polymer- ization of the PAAm chains as well as the polymerization between the TMSPMA and the PAAm chains.\n\n[0202] The method may further include the step of encap- sulating the sandwiched structure with a polymer layer after obtaining the sandwiched structure. In particular, the encap- sulation step may include the step of immersing the sand- wiched structure into a solution of silane-modified PDMS. In this example, the solution may contain a Pt catalyst with a concentration of for example 0.1% v/w and a silane- modified PDMS precursor. The silane-modified PDMS pre- cursor may include a curing agent of Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) and a liquid base at a weight ratio of 10:1, and TEOVS (i.e. second coupling agent).\n\n[0195] At this stage, the as-obtained hydrogel includes covalently crosslinked PAAm network functionalized with TMSPMA with un-crosslinked alginate chains dispersed among the PAAm network. The as-prepared hydrogel may be peeled off and optionally dried under room temperature or an elevated temperature.\n\n[0203] The sandwiched structure may be repeatedly immersed into the solution of silane-modified PDMS for at least 5 times so to have suflicient amount of the solution retaining on the surface of the sandwiched structure. The structure containing the solution may then dried at an\n\n[0196] The cured hydrogel may then be soaked into an aqueous electrolytic solution to promote ion conductivity of the electrolyte and the formation of the ionic crosslinked\n\nPPy\n\nas\n\n[0198] Alternatively, the electrolytic solution may contain other salts, acids or the combination thereof in addition to the EG and SDS. In one example, the electrolytic solution may contain zinc(II) sulphate at a concentration of for example 2 mol L ~' and Li2SO4 at a concentration of for example 0.5 mol L~?. In another example, the electrolytic solution may contain H,PO, at concentration of for example 2 wt %.\n\na\n\nJan. 14 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0013551 A1\n\n11\n\nhydrogel matrix .

The synthesized AD-gel electrolyte exhib- ited a transparent state (FIG. 5A). For the ease of visualization, a blue ink was doped into precursors of the AD-gel prior to performing polymerization (FIG. 5B).\n\n[0204] The characterization and performance of embodi- ments of the electrolyte and the electrical energy storage device containing said electrolyte will now be discussed. Structural and phase characterizations of the as-prepared electrodes were performed by XRD using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer with Cu Ko irradiation (A=1.54 A. The surface morphology of these samples was characterized by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, FEI/Philips XL30). The morphology and microstructure of the samples were revealed by a JEOL-2001F field-emission TEM.\n\n[0212] The freezing point of the AD-gel may be controlled by tuning the ethylene glycol (EG) weight contents as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B. In general, the freezing point of the AD-gel decreases (ie. becomes more negative) with an increase in the EG content. In particular, a freezing point of -20.8\u00b0 C. was obtained with the use of 30 wt % of EG (FIG. 6B).\n\n[0213] The results of thermodynamic test indicated that the elastomer (PDMS) coating can effectively prevent water evaporation over 120\u00b0 C., while the normal PAM-hydrogel lost its weight approaching to its original water contents under the same conditions (~80 wt %) (FIG. 7A). In addi- tion, DSC analysis indicated that the crystallization tmepera- ture of the AD-gel was about -23\u00b0 C., suggesting that the anti-freezing property of the AD-gel (FIG. 7B).\n\n[0205] Electrochemical performance of the fabricated gel Zn \u4e00 MnO: battery were examined based on galvanos- tatic testing in the voltage range of 0.8-1.85 V using a Land 2001 A battery testing system. The volumetric energy density (E) of the full battery was calculated by\n\nE=[oilvydtlV\u00a5\n\n[0214] After storing the AD-gel at -20\u00b0 C. or 80\u00b0 C. for one day, the mechanical properties of the AD-gel were well persevered, exhibiting impressive flexibility to endure large deformations including twisting and compressing (FIG. 8A). Once the external force is withdrawn, the AD-gel quickly recovered from the deformed shapes, showing a high resil- ience. In sharp contrast, the PAM-hydrogel electrolyte was frozen into solid at -20\u00b0 C., and dried out at 80\u00b0 C. (FIG. 8A). Correspondingly, the quantified tensile strength and compression strength of the AD-gel electrolyte display simi- lar value with subtle changes after cooling or heating, sharply contrasting with the appreciable deterioration in the mechanical properties of PAM-hydrogel electrolyte (FIGS. 8B to\n\n[0206] where I is the discharge current, Yo is the dis- charge voltage at time t, dt is time differential, and V is the total volume of the whole solid-state device, which is calculated by multiplying the surface area and the thickness of the batteries.\n\n[0207] Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical imped- ance spectroscopy (100 kHz to 0.1 Hz) were conducted by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D). The ionic con- ductivity of polymer electrolyte can be calculated by ohmic resistance, which can be obtained from the AC impedance spectra. The equation of ionic conductivity G was calculated by\n\n[0215] The excellent temperature tolerance of the AD-gel electrolyte may be attributed to the synergistic effects elu- cidated as follows: (1) The non-volatile EG molecules existed in the gel network form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules thereby disrupting the crystallization of ice at subzero temperatures, such disruption in turn depresses the freezing point of the organohydrogel. (2) The anti- dehydration elastomeric coating layer can prevent evapora- tion of water molecules from the inner gel matrix, endowing the organohydrogel with good consistency and durability at high temperatures.\n\nL\n\n[0208] where a is ionic conductivity of polymer electro- lyte, and 1, R, and A represent the thickness, the bulk resistance, and the test area of polymer electrolyte, respec- tively.\n\n[0209] With the use of the design principles, a family AD-gel electrolyte with elastomeric coating was synthesized according to the proposed fabrication method (FIG. 2a). The morphology of the as-synthesized AD-gel was examined SEM.\n\n[0216] In terms of the long-term stability, dehydration test was carried out on the AD-gel and PAM-hydrogel electro- lytes with the same dimensions. The test was performed at 25\u00b0 C. and 50% humidity, and the weight retention of the AD-gel and PAM-hydrogel electrolytes was recorded at different time intervals. As illustrated in FIGS. 9A and 9B, the weight of AD-gel electrolyte was minorly drifted (<2%) even after 30 days of storage, whereas the PAM-hydrogel electrolyte lost most its weight after the initial 5 days and finally dried out to become a hard scaffold (FIG. 9A).\n\n[0210] With reference to FIG. 3A, it is revealed that the AD-gel has a coating of approximately 200 wm. Cross- sectional SEM mapping and EDS results intuitively depict the conformal and continuous interface between organohy- drogel matrix (i.e. Zn-alginate/PAM) and superficial coating (i.e. PDMS) with close contact.

FIG . 13A showed the XRD pattern of a\n\nUS 2021/0013551 Al\n\nJan. 14, 2021\n\ndeposited MnO,@SS mesh electrode, in which all charac- teristic peaks were well-indexed to Akhtenskite MnO, (JICPDS 30-0820).\n\nratio of the AD-gel remained unchanged under the same experimental conditions. This may be abscribed to the synergies of EG and elastomer coating of the AD-gel. In addition, an AD-gel electrolyte with arbitrary shape was immersed in a dye bath for 1 h. It was found that the color was readily washed away by clean water (FIG. 11). This result may reveal that the elastomer coating retards the mass exchange between the inner organohydrogel matrix with the outer environment. In other words, the coating may have perfectly sealed the hydrogel with arbitrary shape from external environment.\n\n[0222] spin-energy separation of the Mn 3 s doublet is 4.84 eV, indicating that the Mn element in the electrodeposited MnO, has a charge state of approximate 4.0 (FIG. 13B). The SEM images intuitively showed that the MnO, comprises a highly porous structure of interconnected nanoflakes (FIG. 13C). As depicted in the TEM images (FIG. 13D), the porous MnO, nanoflakes are polycrystalline consisting of nanograins with asize of approximately 10 nm. The SEM image of Zn anode, as given in FIG. 13E, showed that the electroplated zine on the SS mesh existed as uniform porous nanosheet structure, which may facilitate the interfacial compatibility of elec- trode-electrolyte and enable a fast charge\n\n[0218] In order to measure the ionic conductivity of the AD-gel electrolyte, two plates of stainless steel were wrapped into the AD-gel electrolyte before the elastomer coating process. As shown in FIG. 12A, the ionic conduc- tivity of AD-gel electrolyte containing 2 mol L~* of ZnSO, and 0.1 mol L~! of MnSO, was calculated to be 16.3 mS cem\u2122', which was comparable to other ionic conducting polyelectrolytes with zinc ion as shown in Table 1 below.\n\n[0223] The inventors devise that many of the existing flexible electrical energy storage devices are of a sand- wiched structure that includes two electrodes that sand- wiches a layer of electrolyte. In such relatively simple structure, water molecules may easily evaporate from the exposed part of hydrogel electrolyte, or through the elec- trodes which may employ a carbon cloth as a current collector.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTonic conductivity of AD-gel electrolyte and various zine salts-containing polyelectrolytes.

The electrolyte may also be applied to diverse flexible electrical energy storage devices.\n\nhaving AD-gel electrolyte that provides excellent water retention property may be fabricated. In this embodiment, the electrodes are wrapped inside the polyelectrolyte. The manufacturing process of the rechargeable Zn\u2014Mn0O, bat- tery based AD-gel electrolyte (AD-battery) 1400 is sche- matically illustrated in FIG. 14. The prepared electrodes were first fixed nominally in the middle of two glass plates by utilizing a 2 mm thick silicone spacer which also serving as a reaction mould for polyelectrolyte. Next, a solution containing various precursors was injected into the reaction mould and an AD-gel electrolyte was obtained after the photo-induced free radical polymerization. After that, the elastomeric coating process of the as-prepared battery was performed by dipping the battery into a silane precursor solution for five times, followed by drying the battery in an oven. In addition, pure PAM-hydrogel electrolyte based Zn\u2014Mn0O, battery (PAM-battery) was also fabricated as the\n\n[0219] The ionic conductivity of the AD-gel maintained a similar value of 14.1 mS cm7! even at -20\u00b0 C. (FIG, 12A). This may be ascribed to highly porous structure of the AD-gel under such temperature. As shown in FIG. 12B, the highly porous structure of the AD-gel was maintained after subjecting to freeze-dry for 24 h. The abundant microphores within the polymer matrix provides a large amount of channels for zinc ion transportation, rendering highly ionic conductivity of the AD-gel even under a low temperature.\n\n[0220] The Ad-gel also possessed a higher value of ionic conductivity (18.2 mS cm\u2122') at 80\u00b0 C. as a result of increase in diffusion velocity of zinc ions at high temperature. Furthermore, no appreciable deterioration in the ionic con- ductivity was observed after 30 d of long-term storage in air (FIG. 12A). The stable electrochemical performance of the AD-gel under the aforesaid conditions was also observed in the AC impedance spectra as shown in FIG, 12C. All these results confirm the extremely temperature tolerance and anti-dehydration function of AD-gel electrolyte for long- term application.\n\n[0226] The electrochemical performance of the fabricated AD-battery 1400 under normal condition (25\u00b0 C.) was investigated. As shown in FIG. 15A, the CV curves of Zn anode revealed that the plating/stripping of the deposited zinc is stable with nearly overlapped curves. For the depos- ited MnO, cathode, it is observed that two distinguishable redox peaks occur in the discharge/charge process and the CVs remained invariable after several cycles, demonstrating a good reversibility of the cathode.\n\n[0221] Preferably, a rechargeable Zn\u2014Mn0O, battery con- taining the aforesaid AD-gel may be fabricated in accor- dance with the fabrication method as discussed, by combin- ing electrodes with the fabricated AD-gel. Binder-free electrodes were prepared by an in-situ electrodeposition method, which can provide an intimate direct contact of Zn or MnO, with the current collectors such as stainless steel mesh (SS mesh). FIG. 13A showed the XRD pattern of a\n\n[0227] As illustrated in FIG. 15B, the AD-battery 1400 delivered a high discharge capacity of 272 mAh g~! with two stable potential plateaus at a current density of 0.1 A g~'.

The energy densities of the AD-battery at -20\u00b0 C. and 80\u00b0 C. were 65% and 108% retention of that at 25\u00b0 C. (FIG. 17). The enhanced battery performance at 80\u00b0 C. was mainly ascribed to the increase of ion transport kinetics in the electrolyte at high temperatures.\n\nmV s7!, the CV curves exhibited similar shapes gradual broaden peaks as a result of polarization.\n\n[0228] The rate performance of the battery at different current densities is illustrated in FIG. 15D. The battery exhibited high discharge capacities of 273, 237, 198, 148, and 114 mA h g 1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 A gl, respectively. After cycling back to 0.1 A g7!, a discharge capacity of 270 mA h g 1 was recovered and maintained afterwards (FIG. 15D). In addition, the Coulombic eflicien- cies of the battery was approaching to 100%. The volumetric energy density of the battery was found to be 26.88 mW h cm ~.\n\n[0235] To verify the thermal stability, cycling tests were conducted on the AD-battery and PAM-battery in a thermo- stat. As shown in FIG. 18, the temperature was increased to 80\u00b0 C. after first 5 cycles, the specific capacity of the PAM-battery deteriorated significantly with large voltage polarization. The performance degradation possibly resulted from the dehydration of hydrogel electrolyte at higher temperature (insert of FIG. 18). For the AD-battery, the energy-storage ability at 80\u00b0 C. was almost the same as that prior to heating, and the specific capacity remained stable for the proceeding cycling, demonstrating the superior anti- heating property of the AD-battery (FIG. 18).\n\n[0229] The corresponding charge-discharge curves at vari- ous current densities exhibited characteristic plateaus with relatively small voltage hysteresis, demonstrating the sig- nificant structural adaptability of the AD-battery upon deliv- ering capacities at various currents (FIG. 15E).\n\n[0230] temperature on trochemical performance of the battery 1400 was investi- gated by simulating the actual harsh conditions.

The CV curves of the AD-battery were recorded for several minutes at -20, 25, 60, and 80\u00b0 C. As shown in FIG. 16A, all the CV curves exhibited distinguished reduction/oxidation peaks with neg- ligible voltage polarization at the scan rate of 1 mV s*\u2019 , indicating an ideal reaction reversibility. The intensity of peaks afier cooling or heating appears to increase slightly due to the integrity of the porous structure of the electrolyte at low temperature as discussed above as well as faster ion transport at high\n\n[0236] Experimental results of the AD-battery and PAM- battery cycled sequentially at 25, -20, and 60\u00b0 C. are shown in FIG. 19. As the temperature fluctuates, the specific capacity of the AD-battery almost restored to the pristine one. After multiple cycles of cooling-heating-cooling pro- cess, no significant capacity attenuation was identified for the AD-battery, guaranteeing its practical application. The long-term stability of the AD-battery was demonstrated by a prolonged storage of the battery for 30 days. As shown in FIG. 20, the AD-battery exhibited 84.6% capacity retention after a prolonged storage of 30 days in normal condition (25\u00b0 C.) whereas the PAM battery exhibited 0% capacity reten- tion under the conditions.\n\n[0237] Benefitting from its flexible components (the AD- gel, soft stainless steel mesh, and deposited active materials layer) as used, the AD-battery of the present disclosure possessed a high flexibility and architectural durability. As a demonstration of these properties, a series of experiments under extreme conditions including bending tests, soaking tests, anti-freezing evaluations and anti-heating of boiling water experiment were performed on the AD-battery.\n\n[0231] Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots of the AD-battery were also recorded at various temperatures (FIG. 16B). The impedance of the battery increased within a reasonable range from 164 Q at 80\u00b0 C. to 366 Q at -20\u00b0 C., revealing a stable ionic transport. These results confirm the excellent temperature durability and high compatibility of the electrodes and the AD-gel electrolyte.\n\n[0238] As shown in FIG. 21A, the battery was able to endure various extreme deformations of being twisted, bent, folded and rolled, while the battery was continually power- ing an electronic watch. At various bending states (60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and) 180\u00b0, the corresponding galvanostatic charge/discharge characteristics could be well-preserved with subtle changes capacity change (FIG. 21B). Moreover, no appreciable dete- rioration in specific capacity was detected after 500 bending cycles at 180\u00b0 (91.4% retention), confirming the superior stability of the AD-battery against various deformations (FIG. 21C).\n\n[0232] Regarding to the charge/discharge stability of the AD-battery, the battery showed a stable rechargeability without evident voltage changes upon cooling and heating (FIG. 16C). Even at -20\u00b0 C., the AD-battery still delivered a high specific capacity of 165 mA h g -1 (~70% of the one at 25\u00b0 C.) at 0.2 A gl manifesting the superior freeze- resistant property of the battery. At a high temperature, the discharge profiles appeared to almost overlap with that of 25\u00b0C. (FIG. 16C). These results indicate that the AD-battery can withstand a low temperature down to -20\u00b0 C. anda high temperature up to 80\u00b0 C.\n\n[0233] For the cycling performance, at 25 and -20\u00b0 C., the AD-battery exhibited 81% (124 mAh g 1 and 66% (76 mA h g\u2122') capacity retentions of its initial capacity over 500 cycles at 1.0 A gl (capacity decay rates of 0.038% and 0.068% per cycle), respectively. The Coulombic efficiencies of the AD-battery remained as high as approximately 99.5- 100.1% even at -25\u00b0 C. (FIG. 16D). Moreover, the AD- battery presented a stable rechargeability without any obvi- ous fluctuation, whereas the comparison PAM-hydrogel battery showed large augment of the voltage hysteresis upon cooling to -20\u00b0 C. (FIG. 16E).\n\n[0239] In the soaking tests, benefiting from the elasto- meric coating, the fabricated AD-battery was endowed with excellent waterproof property. After being immersed in water for 120 min, the AD-battery retained approximately 90.8% retention of its initial specific capacity with no appreciable deterioration and continuously powered an elec- tronic watch (FIGS. 22A and 22B). In addition to operating in water, the AD-battery was well operable under various beverages, such as beer, soda and berry juice, ete. (FIG. 22C). These results further confirm that the elastomeric coating retards the mass exchange between the inner organo- hydrogel matrix with the outer environment.\n\n[0234] In addition, the variation of specific capacity with temperature (FIG. 17) indicated that the discharge capacity retentions of the AD-battery at -20\u00b0 C. and 80\u00b0 C. compared\n\n[0240] Freeze-resistant performance and thermal durabil- ity are of paramount importance for practical applications of\n\n5\n\nand\n\nThe real-time influence of\n\nthe elec-\n\ntemperature.\n\nsame experimental\n\nJan. 14 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0013551 A1\n\n14\n\ndifferent mechanical deformations , such as twisting , rolling ,\n\nsolid - state batteries working in harsh environment .
