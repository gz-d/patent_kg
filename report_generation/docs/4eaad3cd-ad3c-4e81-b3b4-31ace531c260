The invention also relates to a communication device that includes the filter- antenna.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Filters and antennas are common and important components in communication devices. A filter-antenna (or filtering-antenna) is a device that combines an antenna and filter.\n\n[0012] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch further includes a first side portion connected with and arranged a first side of the central portion and a second side portion connected with and arranged at a second, opposite side of the central portion. Each of the first and second side portions includes one or more stubs. In one example, each o the first and second side portions includes a dual-stub or a dual-stub feed. The stubs in the dual stub or dual stub feed can be of different lengths.\n\n[0003] Existing filter-antennas are reflective filter-anten- nas. These reflective filter-antennas reflect most of the incident energy in the stopband. The reflected energy may be transferred to other components (e.g., a power amplifier associated with the filter-antenna) in the system, which may lead to instability (e.g., self-oscillation in the power ampli- fier). One option to avoid or mitigate this instability problem is to use isolators, circulators, and/or attenuators in the system to reduce the effect of the reflected energy on the system. However, this option would increase the number of the components in the system, making the system cumber- some and expensive while potentially increasing the inser- tion loss.\n\n[0013] In one eml symmetric about an axis of symmetry. The central portion bodiment of the first aspect, the patch patch may also be symmetric about the axis of symmetry.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0004] In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a filter-antenna, comprising a microstrip antenna integrated with an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. By absorbing or dissipating the energy, e.g., energy received from an external source, reflection of energy (which may otherwise affect stability of other com- ponents/devices) can The filter-antenna can e prevented, reduced, or eliminated. be used for transmission, receiving, or both.\n\n[0015] The defected ground structure may further com- prise a first side slot arranged on a first side of the central slot and a second side slot arranged on a second, opposite side of the central slot. The first and second side slots are arranged to assist in absorbing or dissipating the energy. The first and second side slots can be symmetrically disposed about the axis of symmetry. The first and second side slots may have the same shape and size. The first and second side slots may be a generally-q shaped.\n\n[0005] In one embodiment of the first aspect, microstrip antenna is a patch antenna. The patch antenna has relatively low profile.\n\n[0016] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip network further comprises one or more parasitic patches operably connected with the patch. The one or more parasitic patches may be spaced apart from the patch. The one or more parasitic patches may comprise two parasitic patches arranged at opposite sides of the patch. The two parasitic patches may be slotted patches each having one or more slots. In one example, the slot is rectangular. The two parasitic patches may be equally spaced apart from the patch and symmetrically disposed about the patch.\n\n[0006] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the absorp- filter is a band-stop filter for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy.\n\n[0007] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip antenna includes a substrate, a ground plane arranged a first face of the substrate, and a microstrip network arranged on a second, opposite face of the substrate. The microstrip antenna may include further layers or com- ponents. The absorptive filter includes a filter element at least partly arranged inside the substrate. Preferably, the filter element is arranged substantially completely inside the substrate.\n\n[0017] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch antenna has a coaxial feed that extends through the substrate and connects with the patch. In one example, the coaxial feed is connected at one end of the patch and the filter element is connected at another end of the patch. The coaxial feed may extend perpendicular to the face of the substrate.\n\n[0008] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the filter element comprises a resistor. The resistor may be a chip resistor.\n\n[0018] In a second aspect of the invention, there is pro- vided a communication device comprising the filter-antenna of the first aspect. The communication device may be a wireless communication device. The communication device may be part of a communication system.\n\n[0009] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the absorp- tive filter further comprises: a defected microstrip structure arranged in the microstrip network and a defected ground structure arranged in the ground plane. The defected microstrip structure and the defected ground structure are operably connected with the filter element.\n\n[0019] Ina third aspect of the invention, there is provided method for making a filter-antenna, comprising forming a\n\na\n\na\n\n[0011] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch includes a central portion, and the defected microstrip struc- ture comprises one or more slots arranged (e.g., etched) in the central portion of the patch. The slot(s) may be U-shaped. The central portion of the patch may include one or more open stubs each associated with a respective slot.

With reference to FIG. 9, the normalized power loss is lower than 0.12 in the 1-dB gain passband (5.63-5.97 GHz) and higher than 0.85 in the stopbands (5.00-5.44 GHz and 6.12-6.50 GHz) with sharp band-edge selectivity. It should be noted that the frequency response of the normalized power loss in FIG. 9 is almost complementary to that of the simulated efficiency in FIG. 8. This suggests that the band-stop filter and the filtering patch antenna have generally-complementary trans- fer functions, which are required to reduce or eliminate reflection.\n\n[0054] FIG. 5 shows the measured and simulated reflec- tion coefficients of the filter-antenna 400 and reflection coefficient of a reference antenna. As shown in FIG. 5, the measured result generally agrees with the simulated result. The measured reflection coeflicient is below -10 dB over the entire frequency range (5-6.5 GHz). This demonstrates the reflection-less characteristic of the filter-antenna 400. It is noted that the reflection coefficient of the filter-antenna 400 does not have a sharp selectivity. For comparison, a con- ventional rectangular patch antenna having the same length of L, and width of W, is included here as the reference antenna. Its simulated reflection coefficient is also shown in FIG. 5. It can be seen from FIG. 5 that the impedance bandwidth of the reference antenna is much narrower than that of the filter-antenna 400 although the reference antenna and filter-antenna 400 have the size.\n\ngenerally provided a filter-antenna that can effectively reduce reflection of energy, in particular energy in the stopband. The filter-antenna is compact, low-profile, and small, and is suitable for miniature communication devices and systems. The above embodiments of the invention can be used in the wireless transmitter to reduce the system size and loss. The filter-antenna in the above embodiment has four radiation nulls that can be tuned independently to facilitate the design. A resistor-terminated band-stop filter is embedded at the center of the patch antenna to absorb the energy in the stopbands. The band-stop filter consists of a defected ground structure, a defected microstrip structure, along with the chip resistor. Good impedance matching is achieved in the and in the\n\n[0055] FIGS. 6A and 6B show the measured and simulated normalized radiation patterns at 5.8 GHz. As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the maximum co-polar field is found in the boresight direction (9=0?). It is stronger than its cross-polar counterpart by more than 22 dB. The measured H-plane radiation pattern (yz-plane, @=90\u00b0) is not symmetric although the filter-antenna 400 is symmetric about the xz-plane. This may be caused by experimental imperfections including assembly errors. It was found that the radiation patterns are stable over the targeted ISM band (5725-5.875 GHz) (results not illustrated).\n\n[0060] The filter-antenna in the above embodiments may reduce, avoid, or prevent the energy in the stopband from reflecting back to the source or other components, by absorbing or dissipating the energy through a filter (esp., resistor). The energy in the passband is transmitted to the antenna, whereas the energy in the stopbands is absorbed by the filter (esp., resistor). As a result, the energy reflection is greatly reduced or even eliminated in both the passband and stopbands, which avoid possible detrimental effects on the source or other components.\n\nantenna gains in the boresight direction (6=0\u00b0). With refer- ence to FIG. 7, the measured and simulated results are in good agreement. The measured maximum realized gain is 7.28 dBi at 5.8 GHz, which is 0.78 dB lower than the simulated peak gain (8.06 dBi) at 5.94 GHz due to experi- mental tolerances. The measured realized antenna gain is higher than 7 dBi from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a measured 1-dB gain bandwidth (gain26.28 dBi) of 5.86% (5.63-5.97 GHz). In the upper stopband, two measured radiation nulls with low antenna gains of around -23.5 dBi, along with a sharp roll-off rate for the upper band-edge, are observed. The measured out-of-band suppression level is more than 20.5 dB in the upper stopband (6.12-6.50 GHz). In the lower stopband (5.00-5.44 GHz), another two radiation nulls are measured at 5.41 GHz and below 5.0 GHz, respectively, leading to a suppression level of more than 17.4 dB. The antenna gain of the reference antenna is also shown in the same figure to highlight the filtering characteristic of the\n\n[0061] It will be appreciated by person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described.

The substrate of the antenna can be formed by one or more substrate layers, of the same or different dielectric constants (er). The dielectric constant of the substrate layer can vary. The shape, form, and size of the substrate; the shape, form, and size of the ground plane; and the shape, form, and size of the microstrip network or patch network can be different. The patch network can have any number of (at least one) patches with any of shape and form. The patch(es) need not necessarily be arranged symmetrically. The patches could form an array to give an array antenna (integrated with filter). The feed of the antenna can be non-coaxial feed, such as microstrip feed. The feed need not be perpendicular to the face of the substrate, but can be parallel or at any other angles to the face of the substrate. The filter-antenna can be made with different form factors. The filter-antenna can be used for other radio frequencies (e.g., microwave) not spe-\n\n[0057] FIG. 8 shows the measured and simulated total antenna efficiency (mismatch included) of the filter-antenna 400. With reference to FIG. 8, the measured efficiency is higher than 72.5% from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a maxi- mum of 78.5% at 5.74 GHz. The simulated peak efliciency is 89.7% at 5.98 GHz. The efficiency decreases rapidly on the band-edge and then becomes small in the stopbands, giving a sharp selectivity. Since the antenna 200, 400 is matched across the entire band (5-6.5 GHz), it can be inferred that the energy is mostly dissipated in the chip resistor in the antenna stopbands. This illustrates that a well-matched antenna does not necessarily radiate effec- tively. Again, the simulated result of the reference patch antenna is included in FIG. 8.
