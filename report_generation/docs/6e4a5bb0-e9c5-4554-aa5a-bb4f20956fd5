How- ever, such solutions increase transmission effectiveness at the expense of reducing the effective illumination area for solar energy production. In other proposals, solutions have focused on integrating a meshed patch antenna on solar cells or on placing a folded photovoltaic cell, which also functions as an antenna, in the focal line of a parabolic trough. In yet other solutions, a dual function transparent dielectric resonator antenna that additionally serves as a focusing lens for a solar cell panel has been proposed.\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\nThe subject disclosure relates to solar energy and commu- nications, and more particularly to enhanced devices, sys- tems, and methodologies for solar energy collection and use communications systems.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nConventionally in modern wireless systems, antennas are used to receive and transmit microwave signals. Typically, such systems are powered by local electrical grid connections and are connected to backup power systems such as battery banks, emergency diesel generators, and so on. However, such systems merely rely on conventional power systems that, at the source, derive energy from non-renewable fossil fuels.\n\nIn addition, for developing nations, expansion of wireless markets can face unique challenges. For example, in devel- oping nations, traditional power infrastructures may or may not be available. For instance, due to topographical or other challenges, a conventional power grid can be rendered eco- nomically infeasible, which in turn, can prevent establish- ment of wireless communication systems.\n\nAs fuel prices rise and geopolitical uncertainties have high- lighted the risks associated with the primary reliance on non- renewable fossil fuels, renewable energy sources have been sought for an increasing array of applications. For example, wind farms, solar thermal concentrators, photovoltaic enhancements, and other renewable energy projects have received increasing attention from governments, manufactur- ers, and consumers alike. Whether renewable energy is viewed as a more cost effective way to power modern devices in the face of energy price risk, or whether it is viewed as a way of more socially responsible or \u201cgreen\u201d living, renewable energy sources are targeted to an increasing array of facets of modern life.\n\nIn yet situations, a potential user either power generation or wireless communication can oth- erwise prevent establishment of wireless communication sys- tems without expensive power systems being developed to power such communication systems. For example, in a remote wireless sensor network such as a tsunami warning system, for example, the remote monitoring of seismological and tidal stations across a vast expanse of an ocean basin can require remote installations where it would not be economi- cally feasible to establish conventional power generation sys- tems or even large scale renewable energy generation sys-\n\nFor instance, with the promotion of a green environment or green living, it is of increasing interest to utilize renewable energy in modern wireless systems. In conventional solar power generation plants, solar cells are typically used with reflectors to improve the light-power utilization. For instance, a parabolic trough can be used as a solar reflectors to redirect sunlight to solar cells to increase the light intensity at the solar cells, and thus, a smaller number of photovoltaic cells are used for a given power demand.\n\nIt is thus desired to provide enhanced systems, devices, and methodologies for solar energy collection and use in commu- nications systems that improve upon these and other deficien- cies. The above-described deficiencies in solar energy collec- tion and use in communications systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conven- tional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding ben- efits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the fol- lowing description.\n\nRecently, use of planar mirrors as solar reflectors has been investigated. For instance, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the United States has estimated that the reflec- tor-type power plant would be able to produce electricity at a relatively low cost of 5.49 cents per kiloWatt-hour by year 2020, which could make solar power one of the cheapest renewable energy sources in the future. Thus, while solar power is a primary source for renewable energy, typically, solar power generation systems are separated from end use locations. As such, use of solar power still suffers from inef- ficiencies associated with transport losses.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe following presents a simplified summary of the speci- fication to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate any scope particular to any embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some con- cepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\n\nThis transport loss problem is exacerbated by the disparity in preferred locations between renewable power generation systems and wireless communication components such as antennas and transmission equipment. For example, wireless antennas can be located close to densely populated urban centers, along popular travel corridors, or other areas that are economically feasible. These areas may not be remote depending on the geography and topography. However, typi- cally, renewable energy generation systems are placed in more remote areas due to space or other requirements. For instance, solar concentrators require a large area and are typically remotely located to capitalize on lower real property costs. As a further example, wind farms are primarily located based on available wind energy, and can be remote from\n\nIn various non-limiting embodiments of the disclosed sub- ject matter, systems, devices, and methodologies that facili- tate solar energy collection and use in communications sys- tems are described.

As further used herein, the term \u201ccommunication antenna(s)\u201d are intended to refer to an antenna, an antenna substructure, or a subcomponent of an antenna suitable for communication of information over a transmission medium (e.g., a wireless transmission medium), such as for example, for communica- tion of data, voice, video, radio beacons, and so on. As described in the background, local generation of renewable energy for communications systems can provide enhanced efficiency without sacrificing wireless communication sys- tem antenna characteristics. Thus, the disclosed subject mat- ter provides systems, devices, and methodologies for solar\n\na embodiments of suspended patch antennas (SPAs) 100 as described herein.

Thus, FIG. 1 depicts a single-element 102 SPA fed by an L-probe 104 connected to a connector 106 (e.g., SMA (SubMiniature version A) connector) and supported by a ground plane 108.

As referred to herein, such solar energy collection antennas can be called green antennas, in that, according to aspects, the disclosed embodiments can function as a communications antenna while generating from solar\n\nFor instance, according to various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, both single-element 102 SPA and ground plane 108 can advantageously reflect incident light to one or more appropriately positioned solar cell(s) to increase output voltage ofa solar power generating system. According to an aspect, SPA 100 can be optimized at a frequency of interest (e.g., 2 GigaHertz (GHz)). In addition, according to an aspect, SPA 100 can be fabricated with approximate dimensions of L (110)=100 millimeters (mm), W (112)=54 mm, h (114)=18 mm, t (116)=1.5 mm, Lo (118)=21.5 mm, and L, (120)=11.9 mm.\n\nemploy suspended plate antenna (SPA) arrays fabricated or otherwise placed on grounds (e.g., concave grounds) that can provide a light focusing effect.

According to further embodiments, one or more solar cell panel(s) 302 (e.g., one-sided amorphous solar cell panel(s)) of W (314)=60 mm, L, (316)=150 mm can be electrically connected (e.g., electrically connected in parallel) and can be suspended above the V-shaped concave ground 304 at a distance of H\n\nciated ground plane can act as a light-reflecting surface for one or more solar cell(s). For example, in various embodi- ments one or more SPA arrays can be built on ground planes (e.g., non-planar ground planes) that facilitate focusing light for use by one or more solar cell(s). Thus, the ground planes (e.g., non-planar ground planes) light-focusing effects can result in relatively larger output voltages can be obtained from the solar cell systems. The increased voltage can be as much as approximately 80% higher than that without the green antennas. In a further aspect, an SPA element can be excited by an L-probe that can facilitate wideband microwave opera- tion of antenna structures, for which, simulated and measured reflection coefficients, input impedance, antenna gains, and radiation patterns of disclosed embodiments indicate benefi- cial use in systems that require self-sustained power (e.g.,\n\n318.\n\nFor instance, in exemplary non-limiting embodiment o GA 300, one or more solar cell panel(s) 302 can be fixed ina suspended position above the V-shaped concave ground 304 ata distance of H 318 using a holder (e.g., a polyvinylchloride (pvc) holder) (not shown) at an approximate height of H (318)=41 centimeters (cm) above a vertex 320 of grount plane 304.

According to further embodiments, one or more solar cell panel(s) 502 (e.g., one-sided amorphous solar cell panel(s)) of W, (514)=60 mm, L, (516)=150 mm can be electrically connected (e.g., electrically connected in parallel) and can be suspended above the V-shaped concave ground 504 at a dis- tance of H 518.\n\nmunication and solar energy focusing or collecting) can result cost reductions in the design, fabrication, and/or operation systems employing such implementations.\n\nFor instance, FIGS. 9-10 depict simulated and measured characteristics of an exemplary non-limiting single-element 102 SPA, where FIG. 9 depicts input impedance 902 as a function of frequency 904, and FIG. 10 depicts corresponding reflection coefficients 1002 as a function of frequency 1004 for both simulations 906 (1006) and experimental measure- ments 908 (1008). Accordingly, for an exemplary single- element 102 SPA resting on a 20x20 square centimeters (cm?) flat ground plane, for example, as described above regarding FIGS. 1-2, the exemplary single-element 102 SPA can be simulated and/or optimized using Ansoft\u2122 HFSS\u2122. In addi- tion, experimental measurements can be acquired using an Agilent\u00ae 8753 network analyzer to verify simulations.\n\nof GA 500, one or more solar cell panel(s) 502 can be fixed in a suspended position above the U-shaped concave ground 504 at a distance of H 518 using a holder (e.g., a polyvinyl- chloride (pve) holder) (not shown) at an approximate height of H (518)=47 centimeters (cm) above ground plane 504 as depicted. According to various implementations, H 518 can be determined (e.g., experimentally or otherwise) by optimiz- ing output of the one or more solar cell panel(s) 502. As described above, both single-element(s) 102 SPA and ground plane 504 can advantageously reflect incident light 522 to one or more appropriately positioned solar cell(s) 502 to increase output voltage of an associated solar power generating sys- tem.\n\nAs can be seen from FIG. 9, the simulated 906 and mea- sured 908 input impedance demonstrate acceptable agree- ment. From the corresponding reflection coefficients 1002 of FIG. 10, it can be seen that the measured 1008 and simulated 1006 antenna bandwidths (IS, ,l<-10 dB) are approximately 38% and 42%, respectively. In addition, from FIG. 10, two resonant modes are observed. The first resonance is caused by the TMo mode of the exemplary single-element 102 SPA, which can be verified by examining its electric field distribu- tion. Its measured 1008 and simulated 1006 frequencies (min. IS, ,) are given by 2.12 GHz and 2.09 GHz (1.43% error), respectively.\n\nFIGS. 7-8 depict yet another exemplary implementation of aGA 700, comprising a non-limiting parabolic reflector 702 antenna and one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704 according to further aspects as described herein, where FIG. 7 depicts a non-limiting parabolic reflector 702 antenna fed. by an exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna), and FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary non-limiting conformal overlaid solar cell structure 800 (of detail 708) comprising a coating or overlay 802 that can facilitate transmission of light while reflecting one or more of Radio Frequency (RF), microwave, or millimeter-wave signals to exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna).\n\nThe second resonance is found at approximately 2.5 GHz. It can be understood that this mode can be caused by the L-probe, for example, because its frequency agrees reason- ably with 2.25 GHz estimated using a primitive formula of f=c/[4(L,,+L,)]. where c is the speed of light in vacuum. The discrepancy between the two frequencies can be further understood by noting the fact that the primitive formula does not take into account the effect of the suspended patch. According to various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, exemplary GAs can employ the first resonant mode (e.g., resonance caused by the TM), mode of the exemplary single-element 102 SPA).\n\nThus, according to various implementations, the GA 700 can comprise a parabolic reflector 702 (e.g., a substantially parabolic reflector comprised of a metallic reflector, etc.) antenna fed by an exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna) that can be supported by holder or support 710. Inan aspect, GA 700 can further comprise one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704. In addition, one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704 can be fabricated, placed on, or otherwise attached to the parabolic reflector 702 antenna and. under a coating or overlay 802 that permits transmission of light but reflects one or more of Radio Frequency (RF), microwave, or millimeter-wave signals to exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna).\n\nFIG. 11 depicts measured antenna gain 1102 as a function of frequency 1104 for an exemplary non-limiting single-ele- ment 102 SPA. It can be seen from FIG. 11 that the gain is approximately 7 Decibel Isotropic (dBi) around the SPA mode, as expected for the dominant TM mode of the exem- plary non-limiting single-element 102 SPA.\n\ndepict radiation patterns of an exemplary non-limiting single-ele- ment 102 SPA, where FIG. 12 depicts 1200 simulated 1202 and measured 1204 normalized radiation patterns in an elec- tric field reference plane (E-plane), and FIG. 13 depicts 1300 simulated 1302 and measured 1302 normalized radiation pat- terns in a magnetizing field reference plane (H-plane). Broad- side patterns can be observed for both E- and H-planes, as expected, and co-polarized fields 1206 (1306) are stronger than their cross-polarized 1208 (1308) counterparts by at least 20 Decibel (dB) in the boresight direction (@-0\u00b0). Note further that the simulated 1202 E-plane cross-polarized field is too minute to observe in FIG. 12.\n\ninstance, according an aspect, one or more mal overlaid solar cell(s) 704 can include coating or overlay 802, for example, that can be a metallic wire grid. As a further example, coating or overlay 802 can include a metallic wire grid having grid size of d 804. It can be understood that a coating or overlay 802 comprising a metallic wire grid having grid size of d 804 can strongly reflect a microwave signal over a frequency range of f,<fsf,, when the grid size 804 is less than 1/(10 f,,). Thus, according to a further aspect, coating or overlay 802 can be selected such that grid size or other physi- cal properties can maximize reflection of incident radiation of interest (e.g., wireless communications carrier signal such as a microwave signal), while maximizing solar generation\n\nFIG. 14 illustrates a top view of a non-limiting one-to-three way Wilkinson power divider 1400 suitable for use with exemplary implementations of the disclosed subject matter.

As can be observed in FIGS. 15-16, the magnitude passband of the power divider is from 1.45 GHz to 2.23 GHz (=-4.77+0.5 dB, i=2, 3, or 4), giving a bandwidth of approxi- mately 0.78 GHz. The measured phase bandwidth (ZS,,- Z8),1)<S\u00b0, i,j>1 and ixj) is given by 2 GHz (1 GHz-3 GHz), which is much wider than the magnitude bandwidth.

Accordingly, the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) (e.g., one or more solar cell(s) 302, one or more solar cell(s) 502, etc.) in methodolo- gies 1900 can be used to operate any suitable portion of the communications antenna and/or associated or related sys- tems.\n\nIn further non-limiting methodologies 1900, a portion of the electrical potential can be used (not shown) to operate a portion of the communications antenna. As further described above regarding FIGS. 7-8 and 18, solar energy collection systems 1800 can comprise an array of circuitry 1810 that can be configured or adapted to electrically couple the one or more solar cell(s) 1804 (e.g., one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.) to the communications antenna 1808 and/or for operation of the one or more communications antenna(s) 1808 (or components or subcomponents thereof).\n\nAs an example, circuitry 1810 can include any of (and any number or combination of) electrical transmission lines, elec- trical storage components, voltage regulators, signal condi- tioners, Wilkinson power dividers 1400, switches, relays, and. other electrical components suitable for converting, storing, and transporting the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) 1804. Accordingly, the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) in methodologies 2000 can be used to operate any suitable portion of the com- munications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.) and/or associated or related systems.\n\nAsa further example, FIG. 20 depicts a flowchart illustrat- ing exemplary non-limiting methodologies 2000 for solar energy collection and use in communications systems as described herein above regarding FIGS. 7-8 and 18. For instance, at 2002 a portion of incident solar radiation at a selective transmission layer can be transmitted to a solar cell on a reflector of a communications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.). For example, methodologies 2000 can include transmit- ting a portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., such incident light 322 (522), etc. with regard to FIGS. 3-6) at a selective transmission layer (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) of the communications antenna to one or more solar cell(s) (e.g., one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.) on a reflector (e.g., reflector 702 of GA 700, etc.) of the commu- nications antenna, such as GA 700, etc. As a further example, the transmitting at 2002 can further include transmitting the portion of the incident solar radiation to one or more solar cell(s) via the selective transmission layer (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) located adjacent to the one or more solar cell(s) on a side opposite the reflector. In a further aspect, the selective transmission layer can comprise a grid of any com- bination of a metal, a metal wire, or a metallic composition,\n\nExemplary Coupled Filtering Results\n\nExemplary implementations of the disclosed subject (e.g., GA 300, GA 500, etc.) have been explored to dem- onstrate particular non-limiting aspects, advantages, and/or features.\n\nFor example, FIG. 21 depicts a measured antenna gain 2102 of an exemplary non-limiting GA 300 with 2106 and without 2108 the one or more solar cell 302 panels. For instance, an exemplary non-limiting embodiment of GA 300 can be fabricated and tested using, for example, exemplary SPA elements 102 and a plurality of Wilkinson power divid- ers 1400. In addition, ground plane 304 of exemplary non- limiting embodiment of GA 300 can comprise conducting plates (e.g., 2 pieces of conducting plates each with a size of L,xW,). As can be seen from FIG. 21, the measured antenna gain 2102 with 2106 the one or more solar cell 302 panels at GHz is approximately 11.2 dBi, which is slightly lower than that without 2108 the one or more solar cell panels 302 (12.4 dBi). Thus, FIG. 21 demonstrates that for an exemplary non- limiting GA 300, loss introduced by the one or more panels 302 is relatively negligible.\n\nIn addition, at 2004, a portion of an incident RF signal, an incident microwave signal, or an incident millimeter-wave signal can be reflected to create a reflected communications signal. For example, methodologies 2000 can further include reflecting a portion (e.g., via one or more selective transmis- sion layer(s) such as coating or overlay 802, etc.) of one or more of an incident Radio Frequency RF signal, an incident microwave signal, or an incident millimeter-wave signal thereby creating a reflected communications signal.\n\nFIGS. 22-23 depict simulated and measured normalized radiation patterns of an exemplary non-limiting GA 300, where FIG. 22 depicts 2200 simulated 2202 and measured. 2204 normalized radiation patterns in an E-plane, and FIG. 23 depicts 2300 simulated 2302 and measured 2304 normalized radiation patterns in an H-plane. It can be observed from FIGS. 22-23 that for both E- and H-planes, the co-polarized fields 2206 (2306) are at least 15 dB stronger than the cross- polarized fields 2208 (2308) in the boresight direction (0=0\u00b0) as could be expected for a flat ground plane case.\n\nThus, at 2006, a portion of the reflected communications signal can be collected, for example, by an antenna element associated with the communications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.) as described above regarding FIGS. 7-8 and 18. For instance, methodologies 2000 can include collecting a por- tion of the reflected communications signal by at least one antenna element (e.g., antenna 706, such as a horn antenna) associated with the communications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.). In a further aspect of methodologies 2000, collecting a portion of the reflected communications signal can include collecting a portion of the reflected communications signal by the one or more antenna element(s) located proximate to a focus of a parabolic reflector structure of the reflector, as further described above regarding FIGS. 7-8 and 18.\n\nFIG. 24 depicts a measured antenna gain of a further non- limiting implementation ofa GA 500 as described herein with 2406 and without 2408 the one or more solar cell 502 panels. For example, non-limiting implementation of a GA 500 can fabricated and tested using, for example, exemplary SPA elements 102 and a plurality of Wilkinson power dividers 1400. In addition, ground plane 504 of exemplary non-limit- ing embodiment of GA 300 can comprise conducting plates (e.g., 3 pieces of conducting plates each with a size of L,xW,). Thus, it can be understood that the area of ground lane 504 is larger than that of ground plane 304 ofexemplary non-limiting embodiment of GA 300 by approximately 50%.\n\nIn yet other exemplary implementations of methodologies 2000, a portion of the incident solar radiation can be con- verted into an electrical potential for use by the communica- tions antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.) at 2008. For instance, meth- odologies 2000 can further include converting a portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., such incident light 322 (522),\n\n1706 tion\n\nopera-\n\nor\n\netc.\n\n15\n\n40\n\n45\n\nmat-\n\nter\n\n2\n\nUS 8,599,081 B2\n\n17\n\n18\n\n(0\u201310) 2908 and flat (0\u20130) ground 2906 planes.

In\n\naddition, it is noted that the U-shaped ground plane Voltage\n\nthe one or more panels 502 is relatively negligible. As a\n\nfurther advantage compared to exemplary non-limiting\n\n2908 is approximately 80% higher than that for the direct\n\nillumination case (e.g., 2.38 V with the same total path\n\nembodiment of GA 300 (gain 11.2 dBi), the gain value 15.2\n\nlength).

In addition to the\n\nof the one or more solar cell panels 502 using the U-shaped\n\nvarious embodiments described herein, it is to be understood\n\nUS 8,599,081 B2\n\n17\n\n18\n\n(8,=10\u00b0) 2908 and flat (9 =07) ground 2906 planes. It can observed from FIG. 29 that the output voltage 2902 of solar energy collection antenna 500 is higher when U-shaped ground plane 504 is used, as expected.\n\nAccordingly, as can be seen from FIG. 24, the measured antenna gain 2402 with 2406 the one or more solar cell 502 panels at 2 GHz is approximately 15.2 dBi, which is slightly lower than that without 2408 the one or more solar cell panels 502 (15.5 dBi). Thus, FIG. 24 demonstrates that for a non- limiting implementation of GA 500, the loss introduced by the one or more panels 502 is relatively negligible. As a further advantage compared to exemplary non-limiting embodiment of GA 300 (gain 11.2 dBi), the gain value 15.2 dBi for non-limiting implementation of GA 500 is signifi- cantly higher due in part to a larger ground plane 504.\n\nFor instance, an output voltage 2902 of 4.27 V was obtained when the light 2710 is incident normally (00\u00b0). In addition, it is noted that the U-shaped ground plane voltage 2908 is approximately 80% higher than that for the direct- illumination case (e.g., 2.38 V with the same total path length). Moreover, the U-shaped ground plane voltage 2908 is also higher than that exemplary non-limiting GA 300 due in part a larger reflecting surface between ground plane 504 and ground plan 304. Note further that the maximum output volt- age 2902 of non-limiting implementation of GA 500 is found at 8=6\u00b0, instead of 8-0\u00b0, due in part to the net effect of diffractions, reflections, and light blockage due to the one or more solar cell panels 502.\n\nFIGS. 25-26 depict simulated and measured normalized radiation patterns ofa further non-limiting implementation of a GA 500, where FIG. 25 depicts 2500 simulated 2502 and measured 2504 normalized radiation patterns in an E-plane, and FIG. 26 depicts 2600 simulated 2602 and measured 2604 normalized radiation patterns in an H-plane. It can be observed from FIGS. 25-26 that the co-polarized fields 2506 (2606) are at least 15 dB stronger than the cross-polarized fields 2508 (2608) in the boresight direction (e.g., @=0\u00b0).\n\nThus, non-limiting closed subject matter, systems, devices, and methodologies that facilitate solar energy collection and use in communica- tions systems are provided. For instance, according to various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, one or more solar cell(s) can be combined with an antenna structure, com- ponents, or subcomponents used for radiating functions, which can also act as a light reflector for the one or more solar cell(s). According to an aspect, implementations of the dis- closed subject matter provide self-sustaining power to wire- less systems employing such implementations. As a further advantage, the dual function characteristic (e.g., radiating for wireless communication and solar energy focusing or collect- ing) can result in cost reductions in the design, fabrication, and/or operation of systems employing such implementa- tions. In addition, as described above, the various exemplary implementations can be applied to other areas of wireless communications, optical applications, without departing\n\narrangement 2700 suitable for obtaining experimental optical measurements of various embodiments of the disclosed sub- ject matter. For instance, to obtain optical performance mea- surements, exemplary embodiments (e.g., GA 300, GA 500, GA 700, etc.) can be placed on a rotator 2702 that facilitates measuring output voltage of the one or more solar cell panels (e.g., 302, 502, 704, etc.) at different illumination angles (6) 2704. A light source 2706 having a wide spectrum (e.g., a xenon light source) that can mimic natural daylight can be used to illuminate the exemplary embodiments. In addition, a parabolic optical dish 2708 (e.g., a parabolic optical dish with circular aperture of diameter=60 cm) can be used to used to reflect light from the light source 2706 and generate a nearly parallel light beam 2710 at a distance X (2512)=200 cm from various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. While using an optical lens can produce a relatively more parallel light beam, it can difficult to obtain such a big lens commer- cially for measurement purposes. As described above, height H 518 can be found experimentally by optimizing the voltage output of the one or more solar cell panels (e.g., 302, 502, etc.)\n\nThe word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. For the avoidance of doubt, the subject matter disclosed herein is not limited by such examples. In addition, any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs, nor is it meant to preclude equivalent exemplary structures and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms \u201cincludes,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d \u201ccontains,\u201d and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims, for the avoidance of doubt, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements.\n\nFIG. 28 depicts exemplary output voltages 2802 of the one or more solar cell panels 302 for an exemplary non-limiting GA 300 as a function of illumination angle (6) 2804. For instance, FIG. 28 depicts output voltages 2802 of the one or more solar cell panels 302 for 0,=0\u00b0 in a flat ground plane configuration 2806 and the one or more solar cell panels 302 for 0,=5\u00b0 in a V-shaped concave ground plane configuration 2808, with H=41 cm, as described above. It can be observed from FIG. 28 that when 0<18\u00b0, a larger output voltage is obtained using the V-shaped ground plane 2808 due, in part, to its focusing effect. When the light 2710 is incident nor- mally (8=0\u00b0), the output voltages are 3.77 Volts (V) and 0.70 V for the V-shaped 2808 and flat ground plane 2806 cases, respectively. For comparison (not shown), it is noted that that an output voltage of 2.61 V can be generated when the one or more solar cell panels 302 are illuminated by the light source 2706 directly (e.g. without parabolic optical dish 2708) at an equivalent total path length as when using the parabolic opti- cal dish 2708.\n\nThe aforementioned systems have been described with respect to interaction between several components. It can be appreciated that such systems and components can include those components or specified sub-components, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components, and according to various permutations andcom- binations of the foregoing.
