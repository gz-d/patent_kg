The control module comprises a memory, a state machine and a com- munication protocol logic. The state machine is configured for receiving a current sensing signal provided for indicating a direction of an electrical current flowing through the photovoltaic device for determining whether the photovol- taic device is operated in a generative mode or a diagnosis mode; receiving a voltage sensing signal provided for indi- cating a change in a voltage across the photovoltaic device in response to illumination by an artificial light when the photovoltaic device is operated in a diagnostics mode; and generating a transmission enabling signal based on the current sensing signal and the voltage sensing signal.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention generally relates to photovoltaic devices, more specifically, to an apparatus for facilitating photovoltaic device to provide a wireless communication channel.\n\na\n\n15\n\n20\n\nSince the transmission of information is based on physical phenomena of electroluminescence which are inherent to the photovoltaic material, the apparatus provided by the present invention is extremely durable, as the photovoltaic devices have lifespan in decades.

Despite the fore- seen omnipresence of these devices, they are considered as passive energy generators, as their maximum power output is determined by available sunlight, which depends on environmental conditions.\n\n25\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nEmbodiments of the invention are described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings, in which: G. 1 shows how a regular implementation of photovol- taic system for transforming sunlight into electrical current; FIG. 2 shows a detailed view of an internal structure of the photovoltaic module in normal operation; \u53ef\n\nUnmanned vehicles with high level of autonomy such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being deployed to collect key visual data without the need for physically presence of inspectors in almost every industry that requires visual inspections as part of its maintenance procedures or engineering developments, especially in challenging and dynamic environments.

Another objective of the present invention is to provide a photovoltaic device-compatible communication channel to replace the conventional radio-based omnidirectional com- munication channel for high locality communication and cost saving.\n\nG. 10 shows how the apparatus according to the present invention and the bypass diode are connected in parallel box module; 4\n\nform a junction\n\nFIGS. 11A and 11B show electroluminescent images of PV module controlled with an apparatus according to the invention; and\n\npresent G. 12 shows how \u672c\n\nof PV devices is\n\na plurality configured to communicate with a UAV according to the present invention.\n\nAccording to one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus is provided for facilitating a photovoltaic device to provide a wireless communication channel.

If the control signal has a low-level value representing a logical value \u201cQ\u201d, the switch 510 is controlled to be at an OFF (or open) state for blocking current.\n\nFIG. 1 shows how a regular implementation of photovol- taic (PV) system for transforming sunlight (depicted as wavy arrows) into electrical current (depicted as thick arrows). The PV system includes one or more PV modules 101 connected in series with a power processing device 102. The power processing device 102 can be any type of power inverter or converter, such as DC-DC inverter/converter.\n\n10\n\nThe control module 520 includes a memory 522 config- ured for receiving a parameter sensing signal V_Xsen car- rying sensed parameter data to be transmitted and recording the sensed parameter data. The sensed parameter data may be a sensed value of, for example but not limited to, temperature, electrical current, electrical voltage, or other parameters of interest.\n\nFIG. 2 shows an internal structure of the PV module 101 in normal operation. As shown in FIG. 2, the PV module 101 comprises one or more substrings A, B, each including a group of PV cells (or solar cells) connected in series with each other. Each of the substrings A, B is connected in parallel with a bypass diode D,, Dg. In normal operation (or in generative mode) and under illumination of sunlight, the PY cells are forward-biased and configured to absorb solar energy and generate electrical current. In this embodiment, the bypass diode D connected in parallel with substring A is partially conductive due to one of the PV cells in substring A is partially damaged.\n\nFIG. 3 shows an internal structure of the PV module 101 under inspection (or in diagnostics mode). The PV cells are forward-biased and configured to emit light in near-infra-red (NIR) spectrum due to the electroluminescent effect. Where there are connection issues, for example, a PV cell is cracked, or there are any damages blocking the electrical current from passing through a particular area of the PV cell, only that particular area of the PV cell does not emit NIR light. The bypass diode is reverse-biased and therefore not interfering with the inspection process.\n\nFIG. 4 shows a simplified setup for inspection of a PV system including one or more PV modules (or devices) 101. As shown in FIG. 4, a NIR camera 200 is used to capture the NIR light emitted from the PV devices 101 which are forward-biased. The principle of electroluminescence is based on electrical current being fed back to the PV devices 101, such that the PV devices 101 convert part of the energy into NIR light that is emitted into environment. Therefore, each of the PV devices 101 can be used as an opto-electronic device for transmitting optical signals by modulating the electrical current signals passing therethrough.\n\nReferring to a voltage-current characteristic for a generic PV device as shown in FIG. 5, when the PV device is forward-biased to achieve the electroluminescent effect, the current I,,,\u00a2 is negative, Disregarding the current direction, the PV effect causes a change in voltage under all operating circumstance, A) in generative mode, B), C) and D) in diagnosis mode.\n\nTherefore, a wireless optical communication channel can implemented by utilizing measurable changes in voltage and current caused by PV effect (change in voltage) and driving the PV device in generative or diagnostic mode (change in current direction).\n\nbe\n\nFIG. 6 shows an apparatus 500 for facilitating a PV device 101 to provide a wireless communication channel according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 6, the apparatus 500 includes a switch 510 connected in parallel with the PV device 101 and a control module 520 connected to the switch 510 and configured for generating a control signal V_Ctrl for controlling the switch 510.\n\nThe switch 510 is controlled to switch between two states with the control signal generated by the control module 520. the control signal has a high-level value representing logical value of \u201c1\u201d, the switch 510 is controlled to be at\n\nIf\n\na\n\na\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n35\n\n60\n\n65\n\nThe control module 520 further includes a state machine 524 configured for receiving a voltage sensing signal V_Vsen and/or a current sensing signal V_Isen; determining whether transmission of information is to be conducted based on the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen and/or the current sensing signal V_Isen; and generating a transmission enabling signal V_En based on the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen and/or the current sensing signal V_Isen.\n\nWhen transmission of information is to be conducted, the state machine 524 generates a transmission enabling signal V_En having a high-level value representing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d. When transmission of information is not to be conducted, the state machine 524 generates a transmission enabling signal V_En having a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d.\n\nThe control module 520 further includes a communication protocol logic 526 connected with the memory 522, the state machine 524 and the switch 510; and configured for receiv- ing the parameter sensing signal V_Xsen from the memory 522 and the transmission enabling signal V_En from the state machine 524; and modulating a pulse signal, such that value of the sensing signal V_Xsen stored in memory is used to to generate the control signal V_Ctrl for controlling the switch 510 when the transmission enabling signal V_En has a high-level value.\n\nThe current sensing signal V_Isen may be provided by a current sensor (not shown) configured to detect a direction of a current flowing through the PV device 101. Positive current direction means that the PV device being operated in a generative mode. Negative current direction means that the PV device being operated in a diagnosis mode. When the sensed current direction is positive, the current sensing signal V_Isen has a high-level value representing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d. When the sensed current direction is negative, the current sensing signal V_Isen has a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d.\n\nBy making use of the PV effect that voltage across a PV device rises when the PV device is illuminated, the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen may be provided by a voltage sensor (not shown) configured to detect a change in voltage across the PV device in response to illumination by an artificial light when the PV device is forward-biased. In particular, when a change in voltage across the PV device is detected, the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen has a high-level value representing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d. When no change in voltage across the PV device is detected, the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen has a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d.\n\nin various embodiments, the artificial light may be pro- vided by an external optical source. For example, when the PV panel is inspected by a UAV, the artificial light may be provided by an optical transmitter installed in the UAV as a trigger signal for triggering the transmission of sensed parameter data to the UAV.\n\nThe operation mechanism of the state machine 524 is illustrated in FIG. 7. As illustrated, the operation of the state\n\nof\n\nUS 11,671,731 B2\n\n5\n\n6\n\nmachine 524 may use the direction of electrical current flowing through the PV device as an event A and the change in voltage across the PV device as event B for transition between states. The state machine 524 may be configured to, based on real-world scenario, when the device is instructed externally to start the transmitting, then transmits the infor- mation and returns back to stand-by state.\n\ndevice to provide a wireless communication channel for communicating with a UAV 1200 inspecting the PV system. The UAV may include an optical transmitter for emitting visible light as a trigger signal for triggering the PV devices to emit NIR light for transmission of sensed parameter data to the UAV. The UAV may further include a NIR camera for receiving the emitted NIR light emitted by the PV devices.\n\nDefinition of states and events of the state machine 524 are as follows:\n\nState 1: data recording\u2014the parameter sensing signal V_Xsen is received and a corresponding sensing data is recorded in memory; the PV device is operated in generative mode and the direction of electrical current is positive, causing the current sensing signal V_Isen to have a high- level value;\n\nEvent A\u2014the PV device enters diagnostics mode operation and the direction of electrical current is negative, causing the current sensing signal V_Isen to have a low- level value;\n\nState 2: standby\u2014waiting for trigger signal;\n\nEvent B\u2014there is a change in voltage across the device due to external artificial illumination, causing sensing signal V_Vsen to have a high-level value,\n\nvoltage\n\nState 3: data transmission\u2014the communication protocol logic receives the sensing data from the memory and gen- erate control signals to the switch to cause the PV device to emit NIR optical signals carrying the sensing data.\n\nof\n\nPV the\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nThe foregoing description of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and descrip- tion.

At the data transmission state (i.e., State 3), the transmission enabling signal V_En has a high-level value representing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d.\n\nIn various embodiments, the PV device may be a single cell, a substring of PV cells or a PV module including or more substrings of PV cells.\n\nPV\n\none\n\nAs shown in FIG. 8, an apparatus 500A according to the present invention may be connected in parallel with a PV cell.
