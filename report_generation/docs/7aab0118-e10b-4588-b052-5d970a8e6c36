Zebrafish in vivo bioassay combines the advan- tages of high throughput, as compared to mammalian in vivo assays, and high relevance, as compared to in vitro assays. Recently, two articles have been published demonstrating similar physiological responses of zebrafish to well-know compounds that induce cardiac arrhythmia in humans (Langheinrich et al. 2003; Milan et al. 2003). Furthermore, the ortholog of hERG was cloned and showed high simi- larity in protein sequence in the pore region and the cyclic- nucleotide binding region to which some cardiac toxic compounds bind (Langheinrich et al. 2003).

The common causes for both congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmia are genetic and chemical- or disease-induced perturbations of cardiac rhythm. Over 50 therapeutic compounds have shown the potential to induce unexpected cardiac arrhythmia and some of them were withdrawn from market. Cardiac arrhythmia is now considered a significant risk factor for predicting human safety of new therapeutic compounds. Therefore, drug regulatory authorities now have increased concerns regarding arrhythmic potential of therapeutic compounds and regulatory advice on evaluation of promoting arrhyth-\n\ntime consuming and labor intensive. The simplest method is to use a stopwatch to count number of heart beat per minute under conventional light microscope or stereomicroscope (Langheinrich et al. 2003). An image analysis method of digital movie of heart has been developed (Milan et al. 2003). Average pixel intensity of a particular region of heart was measured. Fast Fourier transform of these data was performed to determine the heart rate. Beside heart rate, other cardiac parameters, e.g. cardiac output, hemodynamics and electrical properties, have been developed (reviewed by (Schwerte and Fritsche. 2003)). Cardiac output, an impor- tant parameter of cardiac physiology, can be determined. non-invasively in transparent zebrafish embryos by calcu- lation of the ventricular volume during cardiac cycle by filming the beating ventricle. The formula of volume calcu- lation requires the length of axes of ventricle which can be obtained by outlining the ventricle manually or automati- cally with the assistance of a computer program. Hemody- namics as determined by blood pressure can be measured. using servo-null micropressure system. In the system, a glass capillary filled with a NaCl solution of high concen- tration is inserted into the blood vessels of interest using a micromanipulator. Pressure change in the blood vessel will move the interface between the plasma and NaC] solution, resulting in the change of electrical resistance of the elec- trode inside the glass capillary. Recently, methodology for measuring electrical properties in zebrafish embryos has been developed (Forouhar et al. 2004). In the methodology, five day old embryos are mounted on their dorso-ventral orientation and two electrodes are positioned using a micro- manipulator, one on the body surface outside the heart and. another reference electrode in the surrounding solution. However, these methods are also time-consuming and labor\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nis due to blockage of ion channels, resulting in delay of repolarization and prolongation of QT interval, characteris- tics of ECG with longer interval between Q and T points (Keating and Sanguinetti. 2001; Roden et al. 2002). Because it is the target of most non-cardiac drugs that cause cardiac arrhythmia (Abriel et al. 2004; Joshi et al. 2004), special attention is paid to hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) which encodes for the pore-forming @ subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel. The channel is responsible for the repolarizing potassium current which is distinguished from other current by strong inward rectification. Inhibition of this channel, either by exogenous compounds or due to genetic mutation, increases the dura- tion of repolarization of action potential in cardiac myo- cytes, resulting in cardiac arrhythmias. Nevertheless, cardiac arrhythmia is not only due to the malfunction of hERG but also other ion channels, such as sodium channels and calcium channels. Thus, emphasis is put on the preclinical screening for new therapeutic compounds with any unex- pected cardiac toxic effects by highly sensitive and specific\n\nas the \u201cgold standard\u201d for measuring of ion channel activity (Fermini and Fossa. 2003). Patch clamp allows for the direct and real-time monitoring of ion channel activity in the administration of testing compounds in whole-cell mode. However, it is a low-throughput methodology and requires highly skillful operators. Although other advanced screening technologies have been developed recently to improve the degree of throughput, all these technologies are based on in vitro cell culture models. The disadvantage of using in vitro model is that complex physiological environment that occurs in vivo cannot be modeled in an in vitro system. Some biological questions of cardiac electrophysiology can- not simply be addressed by in vitro assays. In this case, in vivo models have been applied, including Guinea pig, dog, and primate. ECG is continuously recorded over a range of increasing doses in anaesthetized animal to detect the occur- rence of any cardiac arrhythmia. Moreover, they are not widely used due to the ethical issues and cost efficiency. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new technology with\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates to a method of using a teleost as model to screen agents for cardiotoxic effect, particularly alteration in heart rate and in heart beat rhythm. Teleosts, either embryos or larvae, are bathed in medium containing testing agents for a particular period of time. Then, the teleost is immobilized by agarose, agar or methyl-cellulose.

In the algorithm, a video frame is grabbed from the video file stored in personal computer, either in AVI or WMV format and immediately subtracted with its consecutive video frame.

Thus, subtraction will reveal moving blood cells in the video. A sample subtraction result is shown in FIG, 2. Since the time interval between each video frame is constant and the amount of differential pixels is related to the distance traveled by the blood cells between two video frames, the amount of differential pixels can be used to estimate the speed of blood cells.

Data series of amount of differential pixels is analyzed by com- prising power spectral analysis in which data series of differential pixels is decomposed by discrete Fourier trans- form. A discrete Fourier transform algorithm (Ferguson. 1979) is used. A power spectrum is obtained by autocorre- lation of the Fourier series and is plotted against the fre- quency values (FIG. 4). A total power value of the spectrum is calculated. The highest peak with lowest frequency value (max) is defined as the basic frequency component of the input signal. The frequency value is equivalent to the heart rate. The ratio of highest peak value to the total power value serves as the cardiac rhythmicity index. The principle of the calculation is that when the input signals with frequencies varying around the basic frequency component, the peak of basic frequency component in its power spectrum will be lower with frequency components around it higher. Thus, the ratio of basic frequency component power to total power\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention describes a method of using teleost to screen agents with any cardiotoxic effect, particu- alteration in heart rate and in heart beat rhythm.\n\nThe teleost can be an embryo or larvae of any fish belonging to the subclass Teleostomi, preferably, for example zebrafish and medaka because they offer advan- tages of external fertilization and transparency over other animal model used in cardiotoxicity assays.\n\nExposure of agents to teleosts can be started from the time of fertilization or started at a particular time after fertiliza- tion. The length of exposure can be covered from the beginning of exposure to the time of examination or within a particular length of exposure time followed by a period of recovery time during which the teleost is bathed in medium without a testing agent. An agent can be dissolved in water or medium used to bathe the teleost. Alternatively, an aqueous-insoluble agent can be dissolved in DMSO in high concentration and, during exposure, added to bathing medium directly.\n\nThe embodiment is tested in wild type embryos at 52 hpf. Videos of heart and tail circulation are taken for analysis. Heart rate is determined from direct visual counting of the number of heart beats in 1 min. In addition, heart rate is calculated by the multiplication of basic frequency compo- nent in power spectrum with 60. Calculated heart rate is correlated with the heart rate determined by direct exami- nation of heart (FIG. 5).
