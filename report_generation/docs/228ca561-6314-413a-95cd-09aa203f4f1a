One important issue with implants is that due to biomechanical and physiologic requirements, an implant material should have a certain mechanical strength or elas- ticity to be incorporated into the target tissue and anatomic region. Also, degradability or possibly even incorporating pharmacologically or therapeutically active agents is also desirable.\n\nReaction (2):\n\nReaction (3):\n\nMg+2H2O \u4e00 Mg(OH)b+H2\n\nEach of the existing materials used for orthopedic implants exhibits potentially harmful problems. Thus, there exists a need in the art for an improved material that can be used as an implant in orthopedic and other medical appli- cations, as well as in other non-medical applications where a durable substitute for traditional metals or plastics is desired.\n\nSeveral different materials for implants have been used, including metal. Metallic implant materials are usually favorable in terms of toughness, ductility, and fatigue resis- tance. On the other hand, they are often stiffer than natural bone, resulting in stress shielding. The phenomenon of stress shielding is based on the effect that the implant material bears more of the mechanical load if it is stiffer than the surrounding tissue. This results in a \u201cshielding\u201d of the natural bone tissue from the mechanical load triggering the resorption processes of bone.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nbased on biodegradable polymers and surface-treated bio- degradable metallic materials, as well as fabrication meth- ods thereof. These novel hybrid materials are able to tackle the complications of conventional biodegradable materials (including magnesium-based materials), such as mis- matched bulk mechanical properties, poor biocompatibility, rapid degradation, and hydrogen gas release upon degrada- tion in orthopedic applications. In addition to the enhance- ment of biocompatibility, with the materials of the subjec- tion invention, the degradation process can be manipulated by controlling the chemistry of polymeric materials and the surface treatment of metallic materials as well as their ratio when forming the hybrid materials. The novel materials and. methods of the subject invention have several applications,\n\nsometimes treated with surgically implanted metallic mate- rials. The most common metallic materials used in fracture fixation or total joint devices are medical-grade non-degrad- able metals, such as stainless steel, titanium, and cobalt- chromium-based alloys. Existing permanent metallic implants for fracture fixation and total hip replacement can often cause stress shielding effects due to the mismatch of the mechanical properties between these metallic implants and natural bone. That is, due to a mismatch of the mechani- cal properties between these metallic implants and natural bone, the major obstacle in using these non-degradable permanent metal implants is that they may cause stress shielding effects, thereby leading to bone loss around the implant. Patients who undergo orthopedic procedures such as fracture fixation, often undergo a second surgery after treatment is done in order to avoid this post-operative\n\nIn an embodiment, a hybrid material can comprise: biodegradable polymer; a surface-treated biodegradable metallic material; and a silane coupling agent chemically bonded to the surface-treated biodegradable metallic mate- rial and the biodegradable polymer.\n\nIn another embodiment, a method of fabricating a hybrid material comprising a biodegradable polymer and a biode- gradable metallic material can comprise: performing a sur- face treatment process on the biodegradable metallic mate- rial; dissolving the biodegradable polymer in an organic solvent to form a solution; adding the biodegradable metallic material, after the surface treatment process has been per- formed, to the solution; sonicating the solution; drying the solution to obtain a pre-hybrid material; and performing a heat treatment process on the pre-hybrid material.\n\nPolymeric implants are sometimes used as an alternative to metallic implants. However, existing polymeric implants often do not have appropriate mechanical strength to with- stand load-bearing conditions.\n\nBiodegradable metallic implants such as magnesium alloys have sometimes been used. However, in addition to a mismatch in mechanical properties and poor biocompatibil- ity, magnesium alloys exhibit problems with a rapid degra- dation rate and hydrogen gas accumulation upon implanta- tion.

The novel fabrication methods can help control the material degradation process and provide bulk mechanical properties similar to natural bone. In addition, these new materials are highly compatible with cells, whereas related art degradable metallic materials are not.\n\nincluding biodegradable polymers and surface-treated bio- degradable metallic materials, as well as fabrication meth- ods thereof. These novel hybrid materials are able to over- come the problems of conventional biodegradable materials (including magnesium-based materials), such as mis- matched bulk mechanical properties, poor biocompatibility, rapid degradation, and hydrogen gas release upon degrada- tion in orthopedic applications. In addition to the enhance- ment of biocompatibility, with the materials of the subjec- tion invention, the degradation process can be manipulated by controlling the chemistry of polymeric materials and the surface treatment of metallic materials as well as their ratio when forming the hybrid materials. The novel materials and methods of the subject invention have several applications, including but not limited to orthopedic implantation. For example, the novel materials of the subject invention can be used for other medical applications, as well as for non- medical applications such as a substitute for metal and/or\n\nhybrid can by biodegrad- able polymers and surface-treated biodegradable metallic materials. In a particular embodiment, the biodegradable metallic materials can include magnesium and/or magne- sium alloys. In an embodiment, the biodegradable polymer can be derived from e-caprolactone, either used alone or combined with other lactone monomers. The other lactone monomers, can include, for example, y-butyrolactone (y-BL), 5-valerolactone (8-VL), y-valerolactone (y-VL), and y-caprolactone (y-CL). In further embodiments, other mono- mers can be used, for example, xylitol can be used to form\n\nThe biodegradable metallic materials can be surface- treated. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable metallic materials can be surface-treated by heat treatment, magne- tron sputtering, plasma immersion ion implantation, or plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition before mixing with the polymer component.\n\nThe hybrid materials of the subject invention, which can be used as biodegradable implants, can include polymeric and metallic materials. Referring to FIG. 1, the hybrid material can include a biodegradable metal with a surface treatment and a biodegradable polymer.\n\nBiodegradable implants can an advantage over biodegradable polymeric implants since metal has better mechanical properties than polymers; this can be particularly advantageous in instances where the implants are used in a high load-bearing situation. Biodegradable metallic materials, such as magnesium alloys, are able to withstand higher mechanical loading than biodegradable polymeric materials. In an embodiment of the present inven- tion, the biodegradable metallic material can include mag- nesium and/or a magnesium alloy. In another embodiment, the biodegradable metallic material can include iron and/or an iron alloy. In certain embodiments of the subject inven- tion, the biodegradable metallic materials can be beads,\n\npresent gradable polymer of the novel hybrid material can be a polymer or copolymer derived from e-caprolactone. The polymer derived from e-caprolactone (e-CL) alone forms a biodegradable polymeric material referred to as polycapro- lactone (PCL). Other biodegradable polymers can be formed by the copolymerization process using other lactone mono- mers such as y-butyrolactone (y-BL), 6-valerolactone (8-VL), y-valerolactone (y-VL), and y-caprolactone (y-CL). The biodegradable polymer can be a polymer or copolymer of any of these monomers or any combination thereof. The formation process of the polymer can be either with or without catalysts. In an alternative embodiment, instead of chemically synthesizing the polymer from monomers, the\n\nWith the hybrid materials of the subject invention, the mechanical properties of the materials can be modified so as\n\nThe present invention pertains to novel hybrid materials\n\nplastic in consumer goods.\n\nmetallic\n\nhave\n\nrods, tubes, or any combination thereof.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n65\n\nto\n\nThe novel\n\nmaterials\n\nbe formed\n\na biodegradable xylitol-based polymer.\n\nIn an embodiment of the\n\ninvention, the biode-\n\npolymer may be obtained by purchasing a commercially\n\nUS 10,603,412 B2\n\n5\n\n6\n\navailable sample .

In a specific embodiment, the thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature of about 100\u00b0 C. for a period of time of about 60 minutes. Varying the proportions of thermally treated magnesium beads to be mixed with the polymer solution can result in hybrid mate- rials of varying concentrations. The solution mixture can then be sonicated so that the beads can be aligned or dispersed evenly within the polymer substrate. Next, the mixture can undergo a drying process.

There can be more than one biodegradable metallic material, and these materials can be in different forms. The biodegradable metallic material or materials is/are subjected to a surface modification process to change the surface chemistry for hybrid material forma- tion. The modification method can be, for example, plasma immersion ion implantation or thermal treatment.\n\nThe degradation rates and mechanical properties of the ybrid materials of the subject invention can be determined by the concentrations and reaction parameters during fabrication method of the present invention.\n\nIn certain embodiments, the modification method can be plasma immersion ion implantation with different sources such as aluminum, iron, silicon, strontium, calcium, zirco- nium, carbon, nitrogen, ammonia, and/or oxygen. In a further embodiment, the modification method can be ther- mal treatment. Depending on the biodegradable metallic material(s) used, the thermal treatment can allow formation of an oxide layer on the metallic surface. In yet a further embodiment, both plasma immersion ion implantation and thermal treatment can be performed. A change in surface chemistry can enhance the bonding or adhesion between the biodegradable metallic material(s) and a biodegradable polymeric substrate.\n\nThe novel hybrid materials of the subject invention pro- vide a stable degradation rate for the whole material since the polymer and metallic material are distributed approxi- mately evenly. Additionally, strong bonds (e.g., chemica\u2019 bonds) can form between the metallic material and the polymer. For example, a coupling agent can be used to modify the metallic material so that chemical bond can be formed with the polymer, thereby improving the mechanica. properties of the hybrid material.\n\nIn an embodiment, coupling agents can be applied to help orm chemical bonds between the polymer(s) and the metal(s). The coupling agent can be chemically bonded to a polymer and a metallic material of the hybrid material. The coupling agent can be, for example, a silane coupling agent. In certain embodiments, the coupling agent can be 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethacrylate or 3-aminopropylt- rimethoxysilane. A coupling agent treatment can be per- ormed, optionally including a solvent and a catalyst. A catalyst can be, for example, propylamine or triethylamine; and a solvent can be, for example, cyclohexane or toluene.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nantation Example 1: Plasma Immersion Ion Imp (PIU)\n\nOne of the surface modification methods can be PIII, and the implantation sources that can be used include nitrogen (N,), oxygen (O,), carbon (C), ammonia (NH;), aluminum (Al), zirconium (Zr), iron (Fe), silicon (Si), strontium (Sr), calcium (Ca), and water.
