It was also found that BAPTA-AM treatment of host cells markedly inhibited the expression of JEV envelope protein in a dose dependent manner, as shown in FIG. 1F. Again, these date suggest that intracellular calcium signaling is involved in flavivirus infection of host cells. Similar data have also been observed for EV-A71 infection of host cells (data not shown). These data together support the role of Ca influx or intracellular Ca?* in flavivirus or enterovirus infections.\n\n[0072] Still further, the present invention relates to use of berbamine or its analogue in prevention or treatment of a RNA virus infection as described above, and use in the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating of a RNA virus infection as described above.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nHigh-Content Image Based Assay for Measuring Viral Infection\n\nAssay for Detecting Viral Infection\n\n[0078] To measure flavivirus or enterovirus infection of host cells, the inventors developed a high-content image assay to measure DsRNA staining of virus infected cells by an automatic fluorescence microscopy, thereby quantifying flavivirus or enterovirus infection. The scheme of the mea- surement is illustrated in FIG. 2A. Particularly, the cells are pre-treated with a calcium channel inhibitor before being subject to viral infection. After viral infection, the cells are fixed. DSRNA immunostaining is then performed on the fixed cells, followed by high-content screening and image analysis.\n\nviral infection. The inventors performed RNA in situ hybrid- ization to detect both positive (+) and negative (-) strand virus RNA in the host cells after EV-A71 infection. As shown in FIG. 1A, both EV-A71 positive and negative RNA strands were detected after 7 h virus infection of HeLa cells. EV-A71 (-)RNA strand exhibited subtle co-localization with EV-A71 (+)RNA strand. On the other hand, double- stranded RNA, as shown by double-stranded RNA (DsRNA) immunostaining, exhibited strong co-localization with virus (-)RNA strand, not LAMP1, a lysosomal marker. Besides, DsRNA and (+)RNA were accumulated in time-dependent manner after virus infection (as shown in FIG. 1B). Thus, DsRNA immunostaining and viral specific (+)RNA hybrid-\n\n[0079] assay was applied to screen compounds affecting viral infection, as follows. Host cells, e.g. A549, RD, PC3, or JEG-3 cells, were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicates, and cells were then pretreated with different compounds at different concentrations for 1 h before being infected with about 10 to about 100 MOI of JEV, ZIKV, or EV-A7I virus. After 8 to 24 h of infection, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and subject to DSRNA immunostaining and. DAPI staining. The images were finally captured by Cel- Insight CX7 High-Content Screening platform with a 20x objective lens, and analyzed in HCS Studio\u2122 3.0 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, Mass., USA) to quantify the percentage of infected cells versus uninfected cells.\n\n[0074] EV-A71, performed aforementioned assays to measure ZIKV, JEV and DE infection. The inventors particularly examined the localiza- tion of the virus replication in host cells by co-immunos- taining the host cells after JEV infection with DsRNA antibody and antibodies against different organelle markers. As shown in FIG. 10, DsRNA signal exhibited weak co- localization with early endosome (anti-EEIA staining), Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (anti-Calnexin staining), or lysosome (anti-LAMP1 staining). These data suggested that JEV replication complex is located at a novel membrane structure in the host cell.\n\n[0080] Inhibitory effect of berbamine and its analogues against ZIKV or JEV infection The inventors determined the anti-infection activity of berbamine, a bis-benzylisoquino- line alkaloid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine berberis, against ZIKV or JEV infection. As shown in FIG. 2B, berbamine, the alkaloid of Formula (1), significantly inhibited the infection of JEV in A549 cells, with ECso being 20 uM.\n\n[0075] Accordingly, the inventors have established a valid immunostaining and a valid RNA hybridization assay to measure positive single strand RNA virus replication. This assay was applied to determine the antiviral effect of alka- loids against various viral infections, which is described in detail below.\n\nFomnula (1)\n\nDetermination of the Role of Ca\u00ae* Signaling in Viral Infection\n\n[0076] extracellular Ca \u4eba affects ZIKV infection of host cells by performing ZIKV H+RNA hybridization and anti-ZIKV envelope protein immunostaining. As shown in FIG. 1D, ZIKV +RNA was detectable inside host cells after 90 minutes of viral infection in the presence of extracellular Ca**, whereas no positive viral RNA was detected in host cells after 90 minutes of the viral infection in the absence of extracellular Ca?*. Moreover, in the host cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, intact virirons (staining with ZIKV envelope proteins) were detected in the plasma membrane of host cells as shown in the right panel of FIG. 1D. These results suggest that Ca2+ influx is required for flavivirus\n\n[0073]\n\nThe inventors established an assay for detecting\n\nization can be applied to measure viral RNA replication.

Moreover , as shown in FIGS . 2D and 2E , the pre\n\ntreatment of cells with berbamine markedly inhibited the\n\nOH\n\nprotein expression of JEV - NSI and ZIKV - E in a dose\n\ndependent manner . The inventors further performed a virus\n\ntitration assay and confirmed that pretreatment of cells with\n\nberbamine significantly inhibited the production of JEV\n\naccording to the results in FIG . 2F . FIG . 2G also shows that\n\nthe pretreatment of A549 cells or BHK - 21 cells with ber\n\nbamine markedly reduced JEV - induced cell death . These\n\ndata indicated that berbamine has inhibitory effect against\n\nboth JEV and ZIKV infection in host cells .\n\n[ 0082 ] Furthermore , as demonstrated in FIG . 1D , calcium\n\ninflux is required for the entry of JEV or ZIKV . The\n\ninventors further determined whether treatment of host cells\n\nFangchinoline\n\nwith berbamine can block the entry of these viruses . To\n\nevaluate this , A549 cells were pre - treated with berbamine\n\nfor 1 h , and were then infected with JEV for 80 min before\n\nfixation . Viral positive strand RNA hybridization was sub\n\nsequently performed to detect the RNA genome of JEV . The\n\nresults in FIG . 3A show that the positive strand JEV RNA\n\nwas only detected inside control cells , not in cells pretreated\n\nwith berbamine .\n\nH\n\n[ 0083 ] Also , A549 cells pretreated with or without ber\n\nbamine were incubated with ZIKV on ice for 1 h , and were\n\nthen incubated with warm medium at 37 \u00b0 C. for another 40\n\nmin before fixation , followed by anti - ZIKV envelope pro\n\ntein immunostaining . The results in FIG . 3B show that the\n\nintact ZIKV virus ( encircled in the figure ) was detectable on\n\nthe surface of virus infected cells pretreated with or without\n\nberbamine , whereas the intact ZIKV virus were highly\n\nconcentrated at the surface of virus infected cells pretreated\n\nwith berbamine , not the control cells , after cells were\n\nincubated at warm medium . Accordingly , these data dem\n\nonstrate that berbamine have inhibitory effect against the\n\nentry of ZIKV or JEV into host cells .\n\nNO2\n\n[ 0084 ] The inventors further tested three analogues of\n\nE6 berbamine\n\nberbamine including isotetrandrine , fangchinoline , and E6\n\nberbamine to see if they have anti - infection effect against the\n\n[ 0085 ] As shown in FIGS . 4A to 4C , it was found that\n\nflavivirus particularly JEV and ZIKV .\n\nisotetrandrine significantly inhibited both JEV and ZIKV\n\ninfections of host cells . Referring to FIG . 7C , the EC50 of\n\nisotetrandrine against JEV in A549 cells is around 12 uM .\n\n[ 0086 ] As shown in FIGS . 5A to 5C , it was found that\n\nfangchinoline significantly inhibited both JEV and ZIKV\n\ninfections of host cells . Referring to FIG . 8C , the EC50 of\n\nfangchinoline against JEV in A549 cells is around 11 uM .\n\n[ 0087 ] As shown in FIG . 6A , it was found that E6 - ber\n\nbamme markedly inhibited the infection of JEV or ZIKV , as\n\n111H\n\nmanifested by strong inhibition of JEV - NSI and ZIKV\n\nN\n\nEnvelope protein expression in host cells treated with\n\nE6 - berbamine .\n\n[ 0088 ] Moreover , the inventors determined their effect\n\nagainst JEV or ZIKV infection in another host cell line to\n\nensure their anti - viral effects are not cell type specific .\n\nReferring to FIG . 6B , treatment of JEG - 3 cells with ber\n\nbamine , isotetrandrine , fangchinoline , and E6 berbamine all\n\nsignificantly inhibited JEV or ZIKV infection as shown by\n\nIsotetrandrine\n\nDsRNA immunostaining followed by high - content image\n\nUS 2021/0060002 A1\n\nMar. 4, 2021\n\n-continued\n\n[0081] FIG. 2C also demonstrates that berbamine inhib- ited the infection of ZIKV in A549 cells, with ECso being 2 uM. Moreover, as shown in FIGS. 2D and 2E, the pre- treatment of cells with berbamine markedly inhibited the protein expression of JEV-NSI and ZIKV-E in a dose dependent manner. The inventors further performed a virus titration assay and confirmed that pretreatment of cells with berbamine significantly inhibited the production of JEV according to the results in FIG. 2F. FIG. 2G also shows that the pretreatment of A549 cells or BHK-21 cells with ber- bamine markedly reduced JEV-induced cell death. These data indicated that berbamine has inhibitory effect against both JEV and ZIKV infection in host cells.\n\n[0082] Furthermore, as demonstrated in FIG. 1D, calcium influx is required for the entry of JEV or ZIKV. The inventors further determined whether treatment of host cells with berbamine can block the entry of these viruses. To evaluate this, A549 cells were pre-treated with berbamine for 1 h, and were then infected with JEV for 80 min before fixation. Viral positive strand RNA hybridization was sub- sequently performed to detect the RNA genome of JEV. The results in FIG. 3A show that the positive strand JEV RNA was only detected inside control cells, not in cells pretreated with berbamine.\n\n[0083] Also, A549 cells pretreated with or without ber- bamine were incubated with Z. then incubated with warm medi min before fixation, followed KV on ice for 1 h, and were ium at 37\u00b0 C. for another 40 by anti-ZIKV envelope pro- tein immunostaining. The resul ts in FIG. 3B show that the intact ZIKV virus (encircled in the figure) was detectable on the surface of virus infected cells pretreated with or without berbamine, whereas the intact ZIKV virus were highly concentrated at the surface of virus infected cells pretreated with berbamine, not the control cells, after cells were incubated at warm medium. Accordingly, these data dem- onstrate that berbamine have inhibitory effect against the entry of ZIKV or JEV into host cells.\n\nE6 berbamine\n\n[0084] The inventors further tested three analogues berbamine including isotetrandrine, fangchinoline, and E6 berbamine to see if they have anti-infection effect against the flavivirus particularly JEV and ZIKV.\n\n[0085] As shown in FIGS. 4A to 4C, it was found isotetrandrine significantly inhibited both JEV and ZIKV infections of host cells. Referring to FIG. 7C, the EC50 isotetrandrine against JEV in A549 cells is around 12\n\n[0086] As shown in FIGS. 5A to 5C, it was found fangchinoline significantly inhibited both JEV and ZIKV infections of host cells. Referring to FIG. 8C, the EC50 fangchinoline against JEV in A549 cells is around 11\n\n[0087] As shown in FIG. 6A, it was found that E6-ber- bamme markedly inhibited the infection of JEV or ZIKV as manifested by strong inhibition of JEV-NSI and ZIKV- Envelope protein expression in host cells treated with E6-berbamine.\n\n[0088] Moreover, the inventors determined their effect against JEV or ZIKV infection in another host cell line to ensure their anti-viral effects are not cell type specific. Referring to FIG. 6B, treatment of JEG-3 cells with ber- bamine, isotetrandrine, fangchinoline, and E6 berbamine all significantly inhibited JEV or ZIKV infection as shown by DsRNA immunostaining followed by high-content image\n\nTsotetrandrine\n\nof\n\nNO,\n\nthat\n\nof 1M.\n\nthat\n\nof uM.\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0060002 A1\n\n10\n\nanalysis .

Briefly, A549 cells plated in triplicates in 96-well plates were pretreated with different doses of berbamine (5 uM, 15 1M or 30 uM), fangchinoline (10 uM, 20 uM or 30 pM) or isotetrandrine (10 1M, 20 uM or 40 uM) for 1 h before infected with about 10 MOI of Dengue virus type 2 (DENV- 2). Cells were then fixed at 24 h.p.i. and subjected to DSRNA immunostaining to detect DENV-2 replication.\n\n[0090] As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, all berbamine, isotetrandrine, and fangchinoline can significantly inhibit DENV-2 infection in A549 cells in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate that berbamine and its analogues are potent anti-DENV agents and may be used as pan-anti-flavivirus agents.\n\nIdentification of Compounds with a Similar Structure by Virtual Screening\n\n[0091] The inventors identified further 13 compounds ligand-based virtual drug screening by using berbamine reference.

For infection, mice were injected intraperitoneally with approximately 10\u00b0* TCID,, of JEV. For the berbamine treatment group, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 50 mg/kg berbamine or PBS daily. For the control- vehicle group, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 50 mg/kg PBS daily. Survival rate and change of body weight if the mice in each group were monitored for 15 days after JEV injection.\n\n[0095] As shown in FIGS. 9C and 9D, berbamine treat- ment increases the survival rate of the mice, i.e. protect the mice from the lethal challenge of JEV. The higher survival rate and less weight changes in berbamine treatment group, as compared to the control group, further suggest that berbamine is a potential anti-flavivirus drug against JEV.\n\nInhibitory Effect of Berbamine and its Analogues Against Other RNA Virus Infection\n\n[0096] In addition, other than flavivirus infection, inventors determined whether berbamine has any antiviral effect against enterovirus and lentivirus infection, by apply- the same high-content image based assay as discussed above.\n\n[0092] As shown in FIG. 8A, all these compounds have demonstrated an inhibitory effect against JEV infection in A549 host cells. Among them, 4 compounds including Compound #1, #7, #9 and #11 exhibited highest potency. As shown in FIG. 8B, these 4 compounds can effectively block the entry of JEV into the host cells.\n\n[0097] As shown in FIG. 10, berbamine treatment of cells significantly inhibited EV-A71 infection, with ECso being around 17 uM.\n\n[0098] Further, pretreatment of A549 cells with berbamine also abolished lentivirus infection, as shown in FIG. 11.\n\nAntiviral Effect Against JEV in Mice\n\n[0099] Based on the above experimental results, it has been demonstrated that berbamine and its analogues par- ticularly berbamine are potential anti-RNA virus agents.\n\n[0093] The inventors determined the cytotoxicity of ber- bamine in different cell lines including A549 cells, BHK-21 cells, and RD cells. As shown in FIG. 9A and Table 2, it was found that berbamine has lowest cytotoxicity but highest therapeutic index as compared to other alkaloids (Table 3).
