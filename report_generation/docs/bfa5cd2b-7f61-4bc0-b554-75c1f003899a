The compensator senses an output signal at a passive compo- nent at an output of the regulator; generates a compensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference being a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regu- lator and the sensed output signal; and applies the compen- sating signal to the passive output component to reduce the difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal. The passive output component may be, for example, a capacitor or an inductor, depending on the operation of the regulator.\n\n(52) .SC 323/268; 323/312\n\n(58) Field of Classification Search 323/268, 323/312, 368\n\nSee application file for complete search history.\n\n(56) References Cited\n\nU.S. PATENT DOCUMENTS\n\n1,920,948 A 8/1933 Crouse 5,038,263 A 8/1991 Marrero et al. 5,668,464 A * 9/1997 Krein et al. 323/259 6,476,689 B1 11/2002 Uchida et al. 333/177 6,937,115 B2 8/2005 Perreault et al. 333/177 7,180,389 B2 2/2007 Wang et al. 333/181 7,242,269 B2 7/2007 Perreault et al. 333/177\n\n21 Claims, 15 Drawing Sheets\n\n112 114 \u4e09 AAA CONTROLLER 116 POWER CONVERSION Vor Yo STAGE (PCS) \u2018| 132 124 vi SYSTEM re 120 CONTROL VARIABLES COMPENSATOR Zz, VARIABLES =C Vag = Ver FV; 448 \u201802 = Vrer + Yor Vref = b, =\n\n(*)\n\nElec-\n\nKrein,\n\nPress,\n\n2001,\n\nfor\n\n(Continued)\n\n(74) &\n\n122\n\nUS 8,169,201 B2\n\nPage 2\n\nSmedley, K.

No. 12/435,954, by CHUNG et al., entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPRESS- ING NOISE CAUSED BY PARASITIC INDUCTANCE AND/OR RESISTANCE IN AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT OR SYSTEM\u201d.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n25\n\nThe invention relates to an output compensator for a volt- age or current regulator and, in particular, to an output com- pensator circuit that can improve the dynamic response of a voltage or current regulator, but which does not require the redesigning of the power conversion stage or control stage of the regulator, but merely requires simple circuit connection of the compensator circuit to the output stage of the regulator. Furthermore, the invention relates to an output compensator circuit that is not required to process the whole of the load power of the regulator and thus is a low power circuit relative to the power rating of the regulator.\n\nSince the 1970\u2019s, many research articles have been devoted to different control schemes such as voltage-mode control, current-mode control, nonlinear control, one-cycle control, sliding-mode control, etc. for the controller. To further improve voltage regulation capability and dynamic response, low dropout regulators (LDRs) have been widely used in post regulation of switching regulators. LDRs are linear regulators operating with very small input-output differential voltage. Although they have low power loss, they necessitate process- ing the entire load power of the voltage regulator. The series pass element in the LDRs has to carry the whole of the voltage regulator load current. Consequently, LDRs as a means of compensating the output signal of a voltage regulator are more suitable for low-power voltage regulation applications.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nLinear regulators are commonly used for step-down (e.g. the output supply voltage is lower than input source voltage) applications.\n\nAn advantage of integrated circuit \u2018IC\u2019 linear regulators is simple implementation and minimal parts and low output signal ripple, although output signal ripple is still present. A disadvantage of linear regulators is low efficiency. Significant power is dissipated within the linear regulator IC, as the converter is constantly on and conducting current. Linear regulators are normally used when the difference between input source voltage and output supply voltage is minimal, and converter efficiency is not a concern.\n\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\n\nAn object of the invention is to provide an improved com- circuit for a voltage or current regulator.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to mitigate or obviate some degree one or more problems associated with known methods of compensating the output signal of a voltage current regulator.\n\nSwitching voltage regulators are commonly used for both step-up and step-down applications, and differ from linear regulators by means of pulse-width modulation (PWM) implementation. Switching regulators control the output volt- age by using a current switch with a constant frequency and variable duty-cycle. Switching frequencies are generally from a few kHz to a few MHz. The switch duty-cycle ratio determines how much and how quickly the output supply voltage increases or decreases, depending on the load state and input source voltage. Some switching regulators utilize both variable switching frequency and duty-cycle.\n\nYet another object of the invention is to provide an output compensator for a voltage or current regulator which does process the whole of the load power of the voltage regulator output signal.\n\nYet a further object of the invention is to provide a com- pensator for a voltage or current regulator that can be easily connected to an output stage of the voltage regulator.\n\nYet another object of the invention is to provide a compen- sator for a voltage or current regulator that is not limited low power applications.\n\nOne skilled in the art will derive from the following description other objects of the invention. Therefore, the fore- going statements of object are not exhaustive and serve merely to illustrate some of the many objects of the present invention.\n\nAnadvantage of switching regulators is efficiency, as mini- mal power is dissipated in the power path (often FET switches) when the output supply voltage is sufficient for the load state. Essentially, the power converter \u201cshuts off\u2019 when is not needed, due to minimal switch duty-cycle.

The method comprises sensing an output signal at a passive com- ponent at an output of the regulator, generating a ripple com- pensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference signal comprising a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regulator and the sensed output signal, and applying said ripple compensating signal to said passive out- put component to thereby reduce a ripple signal comprising said difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal to provide a compensated output signal for the regulator, wherein a compensator circuit for generating the ripple compensating signal does not have to process a whole of an output load power of the regulator.\n\nThe regulator with compensator circuit may be provided on asame IC,\n\nAlternatively, the compensator circuit may be provided separate circuit arranged for connection to the regulator circuit. This arrangement enables a legacy device to updated by simple connection of the compensator circuit regulator of the legacy device.\n\nIn a second main aspect of the invention, there is provided a regulator. The regulator comprises a power conversion stage, and a controller circuit having means for sensing an output signal of the regulator and comparing it to a reference signal of the regulator to generate a control signal for con- trolling the power conversion stage so as to regulate the out- put signal of the regulator to converge to a level of the refer- ence signal. The regulator also comprises a compensator circuit having means for sensing an output signal at a passive component at the output of the regulator, means for generat- ing a ripple compensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference signal comprising a difference between a level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal, and means for applying the ripple compensating signal to the passive component to thereby reduce a ripple signal compris- ing the difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal to provide a compensated output signal for the regulator, the compensator circuit being con- figured such that the compensator circuit does not have to a whole of an load of the regulator.\n\nOne advantage of this arrangement is that a compensator circuit for generating the compensating signal does not have process the whole of the output load power of the regulator.\n\nPreferably, the step of generating the compensating signal includes amplifying the difference signal. This improves the efficiency of the compensator circuit and further reduces power rating.\n\nThe sensed output signal may comprise a voltage signal sensed across an output capacitor component of said regula- said output capacitor component being arranged in par- allel with an output load impedance of said regulator.\n\nThe compensating signal may comprise a voltage compen- sation signal applied in series to said output capacitor com- ponent. In some examples, a current source may be used.\n\nThe voltage compensation signal may be provided by linear-type voltage source. This is advantageous for applications.\n\nPreferably, the means for generating the compensating is arranged to amplify the difference signal.\n\nThe voltage compensation signal may be provided by switching-type voltage source. This is advantageous for high power applications, because of the high conversion efficiency the switching-type voltage source.\n\nThe sensed output voltage may comprise a voltage signal sensed across an output capacitor component of said regula- said output capacitor component being arranged in par- with an output load impedance of said regulator.\n\nAlternatively, the sensed output signal comprises a signal sensed at an output of an output inductor component of said regulator, said output inductor component being arranged in series with an output load impedance of said regulator.

It will compensate high-frequency disturbances at the output of the voltage regulator 110 and. gives a modified output voltage signal v,' for the voltage regulator 110:\n\nThe compensator circuit 122 is arranged to monitor or sense an output voltage signal v, across the capacitor 118 and to compare the sensed output voltage signal v, to a reference voltage signal Verof the voltage regulator 110. Due to the operation of the capacitor and/or other circuit effects, a ripple voltage signal is often present in the output voltage signal.\n\nThe compensator circuit 122 is arranged to derive a differ- ence level signal from the comparison of the reference voltage signal v,,,of the voltage regulator to the sensed or monitored output voltage signal v, of the voltage regulator 110. The compensator circuit 122 is arranged to generate a compensa- tion signal v,,,,,, based on said difference level signal and to apply said compensation signal v,,,,,, to said capacitor 118. The compensation signal v,,,,, is an inverse of the output voltage signal v, minus the reference signal Ver\n\n2) Vo'Vo- GL) FreyMo)\n\nv,! is effectively the output voltage signal together with the inclusion of the amplified signal of the difference between the voltage reference signal and the actual output voltage signal. However, as H(S) is a low-pass filter, it will attenuate the high-frequency signal, such as the switching noise, contained in Ver and v,, and will only respond to the low-frequency variation of v, which is advantageous.\n\nIn the voltage regulator arrangement of FIG. 10, the con- troller stage 116 senses the output voltage v, of the voltage regulator 110, compares it with a reference v,,-of the voltage regulator, receives some system variables such as inductor current, switch voltage, switch current, etc, and uses these to derive a control signal to command a control variable, typi- cally duty cycle, to the PCS 114, so as to regulate v, to converge it to Vien The command variable is applied to a gate driver circuit 140 for changing the duty cycle of a switching device 142.\n\nFIG. 9 illustrates in more detail the typical voltage regula- circuit of FIG. 1. In the following description, like numer- to those already employed to describe the typical voltage of FIG. 1 will be used to denote like parts.\n\nThe typical voltage regulator 10 of FIG. 9 comprises a power source 12, a power conversion stage (PCS) 14, a con- troller stage 16 and a passive output component 18. In this example, the passive output component is a capacitor 18 and forms with an inductor 19 an LC output filter. The controller stage 16 senses the output voltage v, of the voltage regulator 10, compares it with a reference v,,, of the voltage regulator, receives some system variables such as inductor current, switch voltage, switch current, etc, and uses these to derive a control signal to command a control variable, typically duty cycle, to the PCS 14, so as to regulate v, to converge it to Vrer The command variable is applied to a gate driver circuit 40 for changing the duty cycle ofa switching device 42. The capaci- tor 18 is connected in parallel with a load impedance \u201cZr 20 of the voltage regulator 10.\n\nIt can be seen connection of the compensator circuit 122 to the voltage regulator output stage requires only simple recon- nection of the voltage regulator output stage without affecting the feedback control loop 132 of the voltage regulator 110. The controller stage 116 of the voltage regulator 110 still receives the reference voltage signal as one input and the voltage regulator output voltage signal as another input in a similar manner to the typical voltage regulator depicted by FIG. 9.\n\nThe interconnection of the compensator circuit 122 with the output stage of the voltage regulator is even more clearly illustrated by another example of a voltage regulator of the invention depicted by FIGS. 11a to Ie.

The capacitor 118 is positioned at an output of the voltage regulator 110 in series with a voltage source 124 of the compensator circuit 122. The capacitor 118 is arranged in parallel with a load impedance \u201cZ, 120 of the voltage regulator. Together with an inductor 119, the capacitor 118 forms an LC filter circuit at the output of the voltage regulator 110.

Thus, for example, as shown aVdd supply input 542 may be utilized anda Vcc supply input 544 filtered by a RC filter after Vdd may also be utilized. The Vdd supply input 542 may act as a power supply for the MOSFET gate drive circuitry and the Vce supply input 544 may act as a power supply for the analog and/or digital control circuitry within the regulator.\n\norder to apply said compensating signal to said output passive component to thereby reduce said difference between the level of the reference voltage signal and the sensed output voltage signal.\n\nFIG. 15 comprises a switched-mode power supply 310 having a voltage regulator 110, 210 according to any of the examples of the invention for regulating an output power supply signal of the voltage regulator according to a reference voltage signal applied to the voltage regulator 110, 210 for providing said regulated output power supply signal to at least one component of the switched-mode power supply 310.\n\nConsequently, FIG. 17 provides at least a dual power source regulated power supply having at least one voltage regulator according to the invention.\n\nFIG. 16 comprises an electronic device 410 having a volt- age regulator 110, 210 according to any of the examples of the invention for regulating an output power supply signal of the voltage regulator according to a reference voltage signal applied to the voltage regulator 110, 210 for providing said regulated output power supply signal to at least one compo- nent of the electronic device 410. The electronic device can comprise any known type of device that employs a voltage regulator, but is preferably embodied in a mobile communi- cations device, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant or the like.\n\nWhilst many of the examples hereinbefore described relate to voltage regulators, it will be understood, as illustrated by the current regulator example of FIG. 4, that the various circuit arrangements of the examples depicting voltage regu- lators are equally applicable to current regulators and thus such examples are considered as also comprising current regulators replacing said voltage regulators.\n\nsummary, there provided an output compensator a regulator that can improve the dynamic response of a regula- tor, but which does not require the redesigning of the power conversion stage or control stage of the regulator, but simple circuit connection of the compensator circuit to the output stage of the regulator. The compensator has means for sensing an output signal at a passive component at an output of the regulator; means for generating a compensating signal based on a difference signal, said difference signal comprising a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regu- lator and the sensed output signal; and means for applying said compensating signal to said passive output component to reduce said difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal. The passive output com- ponent comprises a capacitor or an inductor depending on the of the\n\nReferring 17, battery supported power supplies are used for a variety of applications. Often a battery power supply must be regulated prior to being utilized in a system. For example, in an exemplary system 500 of FIG. 17, an AC power source may be obtained from an AC adaptor 510 which may be coupled, for example, to a public AC power grid. A battery 520 is also provided to provide a battery power source. Switches 512, 514, and 516 and charger regulator 530 may be provided to select AC power from the AC adapter 510 or battery power from the battery 520 to provide the power for the supply rail Vin 525. The switches may also be controlled to provide charging of the battery. The power supply rail Vin 525 may be provided to a number of voltage regulators 540, at least one of said voltage regulators comprising a voltage regulator in accordance with any of the examples of the inven- tion.\n\nWhile several aspects of the present invention have been described and depicted herein, alternative aspects may be effected by those skilled in the art to accomplish the same objectives. Accordingly, itis intended by the appended claims to cover all such alternative aspects as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n\nvoltage range. For example, when the AC adaptor 110 is being utilized the nominal input voltage level of Vin 125 may high compared to the battery voltage supply. However when the power supply system is supported by the battery, the mini- mum input voltage level may be as low as that provided by the battery power supply. The voltage regulators 140 convert the voltage level of the rail Vin 125 to the necessary voltages required by battery supported power system loads such as processor, chipsets, double data rate (DDR) memory and. graphics cards. For example as shown in FIG. 17 the voltage regulators 540 are used to provide a number of regulated power supply rails. The number, types, and output voltage levels of the regulators shown in FIG. 17 are merely exem- plary and may vary depending upon a user\u2019s application and needs. One exemplary type of regulator is a general switching voltage regulator where Metal Oxide Silicon Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is used as power control switch. In one exemplary example the voltage regulators may be \u201cbuck\u201d voltage regulators. Buck or \u201cstep-down\u201d voltage regulators are regulators that are generally known to have an output voltage that is lower than an input voltage. Exemplary voltage regulators use controllers such as the Intersil ISL88550A, Maxim MAX8743 and the Texas Instrument TPS51116.
