Therefore, a convenient and safe electrostimulation device is crucial when it is used in tissue regeneration. Many elec- trostimulation devices are still under research and develop- ment stage, which still need some time to become clinically applicable.\n\n[0003] In general, conventional electrostimulation devices include two main categories: transcutaneous and invasive electrostimulations. In terms of therapeutic effect, invasive electrostimulation is generally believed to be better than transcutaneous electrostimulation as the invasive electro- stimulation can deliver a higher concentration and more parallel distribution of electric field to a target site.\n\n[0004] Traditional drug delivery approaches include oral delivery forms such as tablets, pills, drops and ointments, etc. More recent drug delivery approaches incorporate microneedle mechanism, e.g., microneedle patch, to deliver drugs through the skin or tissues of digestive system to systemic circulation in order to reach the target site, result- ing in a lower dosage requirement compared to oral delivery orms. Microneedle-based drug delivery system is typically triggered by electric stimulation to initiate the drug delivery. A combination of implantable and microneedle approaches to enable drug delivery seems to offer a more powerful, localized and controllable pharmacological treatment than standalone electrostimulation or microneedle drug delivery device.\n\n[0005] However, implantable electrostimulation devices or tissue regeneration require higher safety and biocompat- ibility standards than non-invasive/non-implantable electro- stimulation devices, as it involves application in vivo. implantable electrostimulation devices are also subject to size, shape and mechanical design limitations. Some tradi- tional implantable devices may carry risks of causing infec- tion to recipients, imposing constrains to their mobility, and causing tissue damage during implantation or when there is harmful material leakage. In this regard, some implantable devices incorporate transient electronics which allow biore- sorbable or biodegradable devices after the implantation and application. Another important concern when designing an implantable electrostimulation device is power supply and how it is controlled.\n\n[0006] A need therefore exists for a fully implantable, wirelessly controlled power supply-integrated, bioresorb- able or biodegradable, microneedle-based electrostimulation device for drug delivery and other potential applications that\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\neliminates or at least diminishes the disadvantages problems described above in the conventional technologies.\n\nand\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n[0007] Accordingly, there is provided in a first aspect

Specific details may be omitted so as not to obscure the invention; however, the disclosure is written to enable one skilled in the art to practice the teachings herein without undue experimentation.\n\nTurning to FIG. 1A, a fully implantable and biore-\n\n[0133]\n\nsorbable microneedle (IBMN) device incorporating a wire- lessly-controlled electrostimulation module and drug deliv- ery (microneedle-based) module (as shown in the inset) is provided. In certain embodiments, the wirelessly-controlled. electrostimulation module can be activated by a radio fre- quency to exert electrostimulation on a target site, e.g., skin or tissues of certain internal organ or body systems. In certain embodiments, the IBMN device can be operated in the absence of a battery. It can be either externally controlled and programmable to output a target waveform based on certain wireless communication protocols such as Near-field communication (NFC). When the IBMN device is activated, the drug can be delivered to the target site through the microneedles under the electrostimulation, and can be fur- ther delivered to the target site or its surroundings upon gradual biodegradation or through bioresorption of the IBMN device. Depending on the purpose or application of the present device, the microprotrusion (tip section) of microneedles of the present device can be penetrated into the skin or tissues more deeply for deeper tissue repairment. Since the microneedles will eventually be fully degraded into biological benign end products, absorbed and metabo- lized by the recipient\u2019s body, the materials used to form at least the microneedle-based drug delivery module should be safe and biocompatible, such that no adverse side effects or immune-responses will be triggered by these materials in the recipient\u2019s body. By implanting such an IBMN device into the recipient\u2019s body, it eliminates the need for a secondary surgical operation to remove any implanted devices from the recipient after treatment. Bio-integration of certain biocom- patible materials into the target tissue may also facilitate the regeneration of the damaged tissue, in addition to the\n\ntherapeutic agent delivered through the microneedles.\n\n[0134] Turning to FIG. 1B, the multi-layered structure of the wirelessly-controlled electrostimulation module and part of the drug delivery module of the IBMN device are depicted, in which the wirelessly-controlled electrostimula- tion module includes at least a top layer, an antenna, and a bottom layer. The top and bottom layers of the wirelessly- controlled electrostimulation module can be made of the same or different materials.\n\n[0135] Preferably, the top and bottom layers of the wire- lessly-controlled electrostimulation module are made of the same biocompatible polymer, e.g., poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA).\n\n[0136] Preferably, the antenna includes at least two metal coils for generating electric potentials under an activation by the wireless communication protocols, and at least one dielectric layer being sandwiched between two of the metal coils.\n\nUS 2024/0024646 Al\n\n[0137] Preferably, the at least one dielectric layer sand- wiched between the two metal coils in the antenna is made of a biocompatible material.\n\n[0138] More preferably, the at least one dielectric layer sandwiched between the two metal coils in the antenna made of PLGA.\n\nalso\n\nis\n\n[0139] Preferably, the antenna further includes a modula- disposed adjacent to or on one side of the at least one dielectric layer.\n\ntor\n\nMore preferably, the modulator is\n\nsilicon-doped\n\n[0140] a diode being connected to the main circuit of the wirelessly- controlled electrostimulation module.\n\n[0141] Preferably, the at least two electrodes exposed out of the microneedle are configured to connect to one of the metal coils of the antenna.\n\n[0142] Preferably, the two metal coils of the antenna are selected from a biodegradable and highly electrically con- ductive material.\n\n[0143] More preferably, the two metal coils of the antenna are both made of magnesium (Mg).\n\n[0144] More preferably, the two metal coils of the antenna are Mg NFC coils.\n\n[0145] Preferably, the connections between one of the two metal coils with the two electrodes of the microneedle are two lines (bars) of magnesium foil extended from the one of the two metal coils.\n\n[0146] More preferably, the one of the two metal coils connecting the two electrodes of the microneedle is adjacent to the bottom layer of the multi-layered structure.\n\n[0147] Preferably, the two lines (bars) of magnesium foil extended from the one of the two metal coils are hot pressed the two electrodes of the microneedle.\n\non\n\n[0148] More preferably, the two lines of magnesium foil are coated with magnesium and tungsten (Mg/W) to delay the biodegradation of the corresponding coil(s).\n\n[0149] Preferably, the microneedle-based drug delivery module is also partially or entirely coated with Mg/W.\n\nAs\n\nin FIG.\n\neach of the\n\nand bottom\n\n[0150] depicted 1B, top PLGA layers has an average thickness of about 20 hm. Each of the Mg NFC coils has an average thickness of about 40 jum and about 21 turns. The antenna is in a square shape, but any other regular shape or irregular shape which enables conduction is also possible. A dielectric interlayer between the two Mg NFC coils is also made of PLGA with a thickness of about 20 um. A doped silicon diode is used as a modulator of the antenna and being attached on the PLGA dielectric layer. Two exposed microneedle electrodes (~36 mm\u2019, 5x5 needles) are hot pressed on one end of two lines of magnesium (Mg) foil connecting the antenna, followed by coating a conductive layer of tungsten (W, 1 um). Then W paste (a mixture of W nanoparticle and candelilla wax) used to connect the two conductive layers.\n\nwas\n\n[0151] Turning to FIG. 1C, the microneedles are config- ured to be in pyramid-like shape with a height of about 1 mm or a height that is sufficiently long to provide a deeper electrostimulation at a target site and to secure the device thereon; the bottom of each microneedle is a square base with an average base length (or side length of a square base) of 300 jum. The microneedles are preferably made of PLGA, and further coated with Mg/W such that their surface becomes electrically conductive. An SEM image in FIG. 1) demonstrates that from the bottom view of the microneedle patch made of PLGA coated with Mg/W the surface of the microneedles is uniform. FIG. 1E shows an enlarged image\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\nof the PLGA microneedle patch coated with Mg/W from a perspective view, where the microneedles have a light reflecting surface because of the presence of metal coating. Various chemicals such as Rhodamine B can be loaded in PLGA microneedle tips, which can be visualized in the florescence image (FIG. 1F).\n\n[0152]\n\nIn certain embodiments, the multi-layered antenna\n\nof the present device has a thickness of about 130 jum; to enable certain bendability of the present device, the thick- ness of the microneedle substrate of the microneedle patch (ie., excluding the height of the microprotrusions) is about 120 um. FIGS. 1G and 1H show the result of a bendability test on different parts of the present device, suggesting certain flexibility or bendability of the present device in vivo. Mechanical simulation in FIG. 1M further demon- strates the flexibility/bendability of different parts of the present device, in particular, between the metal foil and the metal coil (c & d) and the connections (a & b) between the metal coil and the two electrodes exposed out of the microneedle patch. The microneedle patch is also bendable, enhancing attachment thereof on tissues with different cur- vature (FIG. 11). The effect of the composition of the microneedle patch on the flexibility/bendability is also stud- ied by performing certain mechanical tests on microneedle patches made by different molecular weights of PLGA: PLGA I (lactide:glycolide=65:35, Mw=10,000); PLGA II (lactide: glycolide=65:35, Mw=60,000); and PLGA III (lac- tide:glycolide=65:35, Mw=330,000). PLGA I microneedles become fracted under low force at around 0.12 N on each needle, while microneedles made by PLGA II and PLGA III are only deformed but without obvious fraction in the mechanical tests (FIG. 1J), suggesting the capability of PLGA II and PLGA III microneedles to insert into the tissue. The modulus of PLGA III microneedles is around 92 MPa, which is than that of PLGA II microneedles\n\nhigher 77 MP) (FIG. 1K). It is\n\n(around.\n\nthat the duration of\n\n[0153] suggested biodegradable microneedle patches in vivo varies subject to different molecular weights of PLGA. An in vitro degradation test is performed on microneedles prepared by different PLGAs. The PLGA I microneedles are degraded fast while PLGA I microneedles still remain stable within 5 days and start degraded after 20 days in PBS solution at 37\u00b0 C. The PLGA III microneedles show obvious degradation cues even after 20 days, thus PLGA II is selected as the material o preparing microneedle patches. The representative H&E staining image of muscle tissue inserted by PLGA I microneedle shows the obvious tip holes (FIG. 1L), indi- cating the sufficient mechanical property of the PLGA I microneedle for tissue insertion.\n\npatch\n\n[0154] Turning to FIGS. 2A-2I, electrical performances o: the present device are evaluated. It is provided that the modulator of radio frequency power supply to a transmis- sion antenna (transmission coil) is disposed near the har- vester for delivering electric current to the interface region of the tissue. The radio frequency power transfer relies on magnetic coupling, where there is no obvious resonant frequency change even the whole antenna is bent with a radius of 0.9 cm (FIG. 2A). FIG. 2B shows that the open- circuit output voltage (~10V) is generated under a continu- ous radio frequency power (~5 Vpp at a 0 mm coupling distance) applied to the transmission coil. Compared with plane electrodes whose impedance is up to 104@ at 100 Hz, microneedle electrodes can a smaller contact resistance\n\nget\n\nUS 2024/0024646 Al\n\naround 10\u00b0Q at 100 Hz between electrodes and tissue, resulting from insertion in the muscle (FIG. 2C).\n\n[0155]\n\nFIG. 2D shows that a wireless control device can\n\noutput a high voltage on a resistor load of 5 kQ under different transfer power inputs at the external circuits. Even the device is surrounded by 4 cm-thick animal tissues (e.g., pork), the voltage on the resistor can reach 6.6 V under the 1 W power input from a 6-cm coil. FIG. 7 shows an in vitro test result for energy transfer capabilities of the present device activated by coils with different size and turns shows that among three different transmission coil configurations: (a) coil A (diameter=4.5 cm, 8 turns); (b) coil B (diameter=6 cm, 5 turns); and (c) coil C (diameter=6 cm, 4 turns), when they are disposed adjacent to slices of pig tissue, including skin, fat and muscle, with a thickness between 5 and 40 mm (d-f), the device with coil C can deliver a power up to 121 mW (i) (input power=5 W, resonance frequency=6.5 MHz, load resistance=5 KQ at a distance up to 4 cm), which is higher than other two coils (g and h), thus coil C is preferred among the three for further testing its transfer efficiency of coil C with different load resistances. FIG. 2E shows that the high voltage can accelerate the degradation process of Mg oils, though the antenna can receive high power and output the high voltage. Since a small voltage is enough for initiating most of the tissue regeneration therapies, an elec- tric pulse of several hundred microvolts is thereby utilized or electrostimulation therapy (inset in FIG. 2F) in the present device for avoiding tissue carbonization at a pro- longed stimulation, while the lifespan of the device can be enhanced. The electric current from the electrostimulation also improves release of charged drug/substance from the\n\nmicroneedles due to the electromotive force.\n\n[0156] FIG. 2G shows that the output electrical pulse signals are stable under different bending situations, sug- gesting their stable performance in implanted animals. The resistance of the whole device will gradually increase with the degradation process, and the resonant impedance also degrades (FIG. 2H). However, the device can output the voltage of 1V after a three-day degradation, which is enough for typical muscle regeneration therapies (FIG. 21). For a long-term therapeutic regime, appropriate encapsulation of the present device such as coating corresponding materials on its surface to delay the degradation process is suggested.\n\n[0157] Turning to FIG. 3A, in order to demonstrate the cytocompatibility of the materials suggested to be coated on the present device, NIH 3T3 cells are used and stained by the Live/Dead kit after culturing for 24 h in a soaking medium with different microneedle patches (PLGA without coating, PLAG coated with Au, PLAG coated with Mg/W). The green fluorescence in FIG. 3A indicates live cells, while red fluorescence suggests dead cells. Most cells are alive in all these groups, demonstrating that these microneedle patches have a good cytocompatibility even in the presence of the suggested metal coating. Their quantified cell viability is further confirmed by the alamarBlue test (FIG. 3B). There is no significant difference of cell viability among different groups, indicating PLGA microneedles and the suggested coating layers have no obvious side effect on cytocompat- ibility.\n\n[0158] Since some literatures suggested that electrical stimulation could improve myoblasts\u2019 behavior including cell migration which is an important stage of wound healing, to further verify that the present device can improve muscle tissue regeneration, a scratch assay is performed to evaluate\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\nthe migration behavior of myoblasts with electrostimulation. A scratch (~700 jum wide) is initially created on the C2C12 cell monolayer, and then the scratch closure process is monitored by an optical microscope following electrical stimulation at different time points (0, 6, 12, and 24 h) (FIG. 3C). The scratch area of the group implanted with the present device is totally covered by the migrated C2C12 cells at the final time point when electrostimulation (200~500 mV, 8 Hz, 200 hs ) is applied, whereas no migrated cells are observed to cover the scratch area in the control group which is without electrostimulation. The scratch areas of these two groups at different time points are quantified, and the result is shown in FIG. 3D. There is a significant statistic difference between these two groups at time points of 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h (p<0.05, 0.01, 0.01, respectively). The group with the present device shows a higher scratch closure rate than that of the control group, indicating that the electrical stimulation has a positive effect on cell migration and wound healing.\n\nIn order\n\nfurther\n\nthe\n\nrelease\n\n[0159] to demonstrate drug profile of the microneedles in the present device, Rhodamine B is used as a model drug and loaded in microneedle tips made of PLGA II to visualize the drug release process. The Rhodamine B-loaded PLGA II microneedle patch is then inserted into an agarose gel with a parafilm layer. The gel becomes red after the insertion of PLGA II microneedle patch loaded with Rhodamine B after 5 days while the control sample is still white. The insertion holes created by PLGA II with Rhodamine B show a higher florescence intensity (right panel in FIG. 4A) compared with that of the agar inserted by pure PLGA II microneedle patch (left panel in FIG. 4A). The selected area is further quantified to display the fluorescence distribution of Rhodamine B released from PLGA II microneedle tips (FIG. 4B), and the fluorescence intensity of the whole area indicates that Rhodamine B is successfully released from PLGA II microneedle tips. The drug release profile is further tested on rat tissue with PLGA I/Rho and PLGA II/Rho microneedle patches, where the PLGA I microneedles are degraded faster than PLGA II microneedles, resulting in a stronger fluorescence intensity on the muscle samples (FIG. 4C), and there is no obvious\n\nfluorescence on control samples without Rhodamine B.\n\n[0160] In addition, the long-term drug release perfor- mance of the PLGA II microneedle patch is conducted by loading aspirin and ibuprofen, which are two commonly used. drugs in anti-inflammation. Aspirin- and ibuprofen- loaded PLGA microneedle patches are immersed in PBS solution at 37\u00b0 C. for one month. FIG. 4D shows the release profile of aspirin and ibuprofen loaded in the PLGA microneedle patches. The aspirin releases more than 80% while ibuprofen releases around 70% after 15 days, indicat- ing a promising drug delivery performance of the PLGA microneedles.\n\n[0161] In order to further prove the tissue regeneration performance in vivo of the present device, various muscle injury models are used, mainly by surgical implantation of the present device into the rat legs. FIG. 5A shows how the wound is induced and the present device is implanted in the rats. An injury (5 mm in length, 2 mm in depth) is created. on the biceps femoris muscle of the two hind limbs on rats. To apply the electrostimulation on the injury, the microneedle patches of the present device are inserted into the two sides of the wound, and the antenna is placed above the gluteus superficialis muscle. The skin of rat is then\n\nUS 2024/0024646 Al\n\nsutured. Passing radio frequency power through a transmis-\n\nsion antenna placed adjacent to the right hind limb of the animal delivers electrostimulation to the muscle. FIG. 5B shows images of the injury sites in both control and those with implants, where the three images at the upper panel are the injury on the right limbs with electrostimulation and the bottom three images are the injury on the left limbs without electrostimulation. From these images, the injury received electrostimulation and drug delivery therapy repair faster compared with the injury on the left hind limbs. The sutures also have mostly healed after 9 days. The microneedle patches are still on the two sides of the injury and adhere on the muscle firmly. There is only shallow injury observed on the right hind limbs after 9 days (top right), but the wound is also obvious on the left hind limbs (bottom right). Corresponding histological sections of muscle defect sites are shown in FIG. 5C, where there are obvious newly- regenerated myofibers in the implant group after 5 days, whereas the control group still shows an evident injury at the defect site. Compared with the implant group, there are abundant inflammatory cells in the control group. Addition- ally, myofibers are primarily centrally nucleated and begin to approximate the structure of the native uninjured muscle in the implant group after 9 days, indicating that the implant group shows better injury healing performance than the control group. The statistic injury depth shown in FIG. 5D shows the accelerated tissue repair process on the right limb on day 5 and day 9 samples in the implant group (p<0.05,\n\n0.01, respectively). Another\n\ncharacteristic of the\n\ndevice\n\n[0162] unique present is that the constituent materials are bioresorbable within a defined time frame when exposed to biofluids around sub- cutaneous tissue. FIG. 6A shows the states of the present device at various times following immersion in PBS solution at 37\u00b0 C. Constituent materials dissolve within 1 month and all remaining residues almost disappear after 7 weeks. A similar degradation process of the present device is observed in the rats after therapy. FIG. 6B shows that the present device is surrounded by a fibrous capsule and gradually degraded in vivo. Metal foils and coating are initially fully degraded (about 2 weeks), leaving the PLGA residues in rats. After 12 weeks, the size of the remaining PLGA residues is only around 3 mm, indicating the successful bioresorbable process. The tissue around the implantations is further histologically sectioned and stained with H&E to analyze the biocompatibility of the devices. The degraded PLGA is surrounded by fibrous capsule, where the fibrosis layers around the implanted devices become thinner with the increasing implantation period (FIG. 6C), and the decreasing number of inflammatory cells indicates that the inflamma- tion is alleviated after a long-term implantation of the\n\npresent device\n\n(FIG. 6D).\n\n[0163] Although the invention has been described in terms certain embodiments, other embodiments apparent those of ordinary skill in the art are also within the scope invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention intended to be defined only by the claims which follow.\n\nof\n\nthis\n\nto\n\nof is\n\n[0164] The following examples are mainly for illustration purpose, and should not be understood to limit the present invention to any specifics described hereinafter.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nof Bioresorbable\n\nExample 1\u2014Preparation Components and Integration Into Wireless Electric Stimulators\n\n[0165] PLGA (lactide:glycolide=65:35) polymers were dissolved in the chloroform solvent to obtain the solution\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\nwith a weight ratio of 20%. The PLGA solution was spin coated on glass wafer (1000 rpm/s, 30 s) followed by annealing step at 160\u00b0 C. for more than 20 min to yield a PLGA substrate (~20 jum). A piece of laser-cut Mg foil (40 jun thick) pattern was attached on the PLGA substrate before cooling to room temperature. Silicon nanofilm diode was chosen for their biodegradability which has been published before. Covering the coils with PLGA and tacking the system yielded a compact, double-coil structure with open- ings for interconnections. After that, two layer of patterned Mg foil on the PLGA substrate were attached face to face where conductive contact pointed are electrically intercon- nected with biodegradable conductive W pasts.\n\nExample 2\u2014Preparation of Bioresorbable Microneedle Patches\n\n[0166] Commercial aspirin (99%, Rhawn) or ibuprofen (98%, Macklin) were dissolved in chloroform and mixed with PLGA solution, where the mass of aspirin and ibupro- fen are the weight ratio of 10% and 5% of PLGA polymers, respectively. Then the composite solution was added in a PDMS microneedle mold. The solutions in the mold were put in a vacuum over at 40\u00b0 C. until no solvent remained. Finally, the solidified PLGA microneedles with mold were put at 100\u00b0 C. heating stage for 2 h to remove residual solvent. After that, the obtained PLGA microneedles were heat pressed on the wireless electric stimulative electrodes, followed by depositing W (~1000 nm) on the PLGA microneedle to yield the conductive microneedle electrodes.\n\nExample 3\u2014Finite Element Analysis\n\n[0167] The finite element analysis of the flexible Mg coil under different mechanical deformations were carried out with commercial software ABAQUS (Analysis User\u2019s Manual 2016). The coil undergone 180\u00b0 bending deforma- tions in two directions before initiating plastic deformation. The PLGA with the thickness of 20 um and the Mg coil with the thickness of 40 hm were modeled by shell elements (S4R). The minimal element size was set as 30 jum, one-fifth of the width of the Mg coil (150 ym), to ensure the accuracy of the simulation. The mechanical parameters in the analysis were Ex,.=45 Gpa, Vag\u20140.35, Epp gy=l6 Mpa, Vpzc470.5.\n\nExample 4\u2014Experimental Setup for the Wireless Stimulator\n\n[0168] Monophasic electrical impulses (duration: 100~200 hs; voltage: 100~500 mV pp) generated by a wave- form generator (KEITHLEY, 3390, 50 MHz) were amplified with an amplifier (2100 L). The resulting output was deliv- ered to primary coils consisting of four-turn wires in a 6 cm-diameter loop. The receiver Mg coils had 21 turns of two layers (42-turn coil) in a 15-mm square connected to a radio frequency diode and Mg/PLGA/Mg capacitor (10~50 pF). The received radio frequency power was transformed to a direct current output by this circuit.\n\nExample 5\u2014Cytotoxicity Tests\n\n[0169] The cytotoxicity tests of NIH 3T3 cells cultured in PLGA microneedle soaking solution were evaluated by the LIVE/DEAD Kit (Molecular Probes, USA) and amalarBlue reagent (Invitrogen, USA). NIH 3T3 cells were first cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin(100\n\nUS 2024/0024646 Al\n\nU/mL), and fetal bovine serum (10%) (FBS, Gibco) in an\n\nCO, incubator (5%) at 37\u00b0 C. The PLGA microneedles coated with different metal layers were soaked in the above- mentioned cell culture medium (1 mL) for 24 h. Meantime, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in a 48-well plate with the density of 10,000 cells per well. Then, the cell culture medium of NIH 3T3 cells was replaced by the soaking solution. The control group was cells cultured in normal culture medium. After 24 hours\u2019 culturing, the cells were stained by ethidium homodimer-1 (0.5 uM) and calcein AM (0.25 uM) according to the instruction of the Live/Dead kit. The fluorescence microscope (Nikon) was applied to image at least three random area of each sample. Furthermore, the amalarBlue assay was also performed to show the cell health condition of NIH 3T3 cells cultured in the soaking medium for 24 h. Specifically, the soaking medium was removed followed by rinsing each well with PBS buffer three times, and 200 pL, 10% of amalarBlue reagent was added to each well. Then, the plate was incubated in an CO, incubator at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 h. 100 wl of the solution in each well was transferred into a 96-well black plate, and the fluorescence intensity was read by a microplate reader (SpectraMax\n\nM65e). These tests were repeated three times for each group.\n\nExample 6 \u4e00 Electric Cells Migration Experiments\n\n[0170]\n\nC2C12 cells was used to evaluate the cell migration\n\nwith electrical stimuli. The Au electrodes with the diameter of 0.5 cm were coated on a cell culture dish (60 mm), and the distance of two electrodes was 0.5 cm. The dishes coated with electrodes was sterilized by 75% ethanol immersing for h followed by ultraviolet irradiation for lh. Then, C2C12 cells were seeded in the dish at a density of 10,000/cm* and cultured with the same complete medium as NIH 3T3 cells or 2 days to obtain the cell monolayer. A scratch line was created on the cell monolayer between the two electrodes by using a 200 HL yellow pipette gun tip. The Au electrodes of the dish were subsequently connected to a generator which output voltage with the same amplitude and frequency as wireless electric stimulators. After electrical stimulation for h, an inverted optical microscope (Nikon) was used to observe the cell migration behavior. For control group, no electric stimulation was applied for C2C12 cell migration. The time spots were set at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after scratching. Each group was repeated three times, and the scratch area was quantified and analyzed by ImageJ soft-\n\nware.\n\nExample 7\u2014Surgical Procedures for Implantation and Electrostimulation\n\nAll procedures associated with the animal studies\n\n[0171]\n\nand the experimental protocol was reviewed and approved. by the institutional animal care and use committee at the City University of Hong Kong (approval number A-0664). A total of ten healthy male SD rats (aged 10-12 weeks, 400-500 g) were utilized for biceps femoris muscle wound evaluation. Another ten SD rats are utilized for in-vivo biodegradability evaluation. The SD rats were first treated with gaseous light anesthesia (isoflurane), then injected with chloral hydrate (10 wt %, 0.3 m1/100 g) for deep anesthesia. Following the anesthetization, a required wound (5 mm in width; 2 mm in depth) was created on the surface of biceps femoris muscle. Then, the two conductive microneedle\n\npatches are\n\nattached besides the wound. The antenna\n\nis\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\nplaced above the gluteus suferficidlis muscle. Finally, skin was sutured for further wireless electrostimulation h per day for two consecutive days.\n\n1 [0172]\n\nWhile the present disclosure has been described\n\nthe for\n\nand illustrated with reference to specific embodiments and. examples thereof, these descriptions and illustrations are not limiting.
