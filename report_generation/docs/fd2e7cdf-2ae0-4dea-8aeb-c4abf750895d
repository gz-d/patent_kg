More spe- cifically, the present invention relates to platinum-based anti-cancer chemotherapy drugs and anti-infection drugs.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Platinum-based anticancer drugs are the most widely used chemotherapy agents in current clinical prac- tice. It is estimated that more than 50% of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are treated with platinum drugs alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs. The therapeutic outcome of platinum drugs, however, is often limited by the serious side effects and drug resistance of cancer cells. For example, current chemotherapeutic agents may be activated in non-pathological tissue.\n\n[0003] While certain specific cytotoxic platinum com- plexes are also known for medical use (see, for example, US 2018/155382 Al, to Zhu, et. al., assigned to City University of Hong Kong, published on Jun. 7, 2018, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference), additional com- plexes are desirable.\n\n[0004] Some previous platinum anticancer complexes bind to the DNA of cancer cells and induce DNA damage to kill cancer cells. However, the therapeutic efficiency of these drugs is limited by factors such as low platinum-DNA binding efficiency, poor selectivity between cancer and normal cells, the resistance of cancer cells towards drugs (e.g., enhanced DNA repair ability), etc.\n\n[0005] Ultraviolet (UV) and visible light photo-activated drugs (herein including pro-drugs) are known and have shown activity against, for example, cancerous tumors. However, use of current photosensitizers in such photo- activated drugs suffers from significant problems, such as side-effects, phototoxicity and cytotoxicity in non-targeted tissue, drug resistance, oxygen-dependent reactions, the requirement that the cancer/tumor/infection to be close to the skin surface and/or other internal body cavity areas accessible to UV/visible light sources, etc. which may severely limit their use and/or effectiveness.\n\n[0006] It is known that bacteria can quickly develop and transfer drug resistance to conventional antibiotics. Further- more, conventional antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) agents strongly rely on intracellular drug accumu- lation for their antibacterial effects. Therefore, the bacterial cell wall and membrane are present significant barriers to the successful application of APDT and related drugs.\n\n[0007] Accordingly, given the current inherent limitations to current technologies, there remains a need to develop additional platinum therapies and drugs for the treatment of cancer, tumors and/or infections that can overcome these limitations. Furthermore, there is a great need to develop anticancer and antibacterial agents with both controllable activation properties as well as tumor-specific targeting. The need further exists for platinum complexes that may effec- tively overcome drug resistance through a distinct and controllable mechanism of action. The need further exists for photoactivatable complexes that may transform to strong\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\noxidants to oxidize survival-related intracellular biomol- ecules and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxide, etc. to disrupt intracellular redox balance to cancer cells or bacteria.\n\nkill\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0008] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a platinum(IV) complex of Formula I.\n\n[0009] where X, X\u2019, Y, Y', and Z are each independently an electron donor ligand, R,~R, are each independently a functional group, L is the linker unit, and n is selected from the group of 0, a positive charge, and a negative charge.\n\n[0010] An embodiment of the present invention relates to various methods for manufacturing embodiments of the platinum(IV) complex herein.

X, X\u2019, Y, Y\u2019, Z platinum atom are together referred to herein as the \u201cplatinum portion\u201d. X, X', Y, Y', and Z are each independently an electron donor ligand; or X, X', Y, and Y' are each independently an electron donor ligand selected from the group consisting of a nitro- gen-containing unidentate, bidentate, or tridentate ligand, an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a phos- phorous-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a sulfur- containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a halogen-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combination thereof; or an oxygen-containing bidentate ligand, a sulfur- containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a nitrogen-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand, a phosphorous-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combination thereof; or an oxygen-containing bidentate ligand, a nitro- gen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combi- nation thereof. Z may be selected from the group of an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a sulfur- containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a nitrogen-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand, a halogen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combination thereof, or an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand; or an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand containing at least one functional group. The functional group may be, for example, a carboxyl acid group, an amino-group, a hydroxy group, a thiol group, and a combination thereof. For all the above-mentioned ligands, at least one nitrogen, oxygen, halogen, sulfur, or phosphorous atom should be directly-connected to platinum center via unpaired electron pairs, which can form coordinate covalent bond with plati- num center; thus, these groups can connect with platinum center and become the ligands of platinum complexes. In an embodiment herein, the ligand is a nitrogen-, oxygen-, and/or halogen-containing ligand, as it is believed that most current clinical platinum drugs contain these three kinds of ligands. It is believed that nitrogen, oxygen, halogen, sulfur, and phosphorous are excellent coordination atoms, they can easily form coordination bonds with platinum through unidentate, bidentate, or tridentate ligands. The unidentate, bidentate, and tridentate ligands of above ligands for devel-\n\noping platinum complexes are widely reported in many papers, some examples of which are indicated below:\n\nNitrogen- or halogen-containing unidentate ligands\n\nCisplatin\n\n(Clinical dmg)\n\nNitrogen-, oxygen-, or halogen-containing unidentate and bidentate ligands\n\noO 0 O EDN, 2 \\ vA \u201c\\ HN 0 lo)\n\noO\n\n_ Carboplatin (Clinical drug)\n\nOxaliplatin (Clinical drug}\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\n-continued O IN2 | CI \u5c0f N CI \u6bd4 a 0\n\nSatraplatin\n\n(Phase II drug candidate)\n\nNitrogen-containing tridentate ligands\n\nCan.

The functional group may be selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group that containing 1-50 carbon atoms, a nitrogen-containing group that containing 1-50 nitrogen or carbon atoms with the nitrogen directly- connect to the main ring structure, an oxygen-containing group that containing 1-50 oxygen or carbon atoms with the oxygen directly-connect to the main ring structure, a phos- phorous-containing group that containing 1-50 phosphorous or carbon atoms with the phosphorous directly-connect to the main ring structure, a sulfur-containing group that con- taining 1-50 sulfur or carbon atoms with the sulfur directly- connect to the main ring structure, a halogen with the halogen directly-connect to the main ring structure and a combination thereof, or a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon\n\ngroup containing 1-50 carbon atoms, a nitrogen-containing\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\ngroup that containing 1-50 nitrogen or carbon atoms with the\n\nnitrogen directly-connect to the main ring structure, an oxygen-containing group that containing 1-50 oxygen or carbon atoms with the oxygen directly-connect to the main ring structure; and a combination thereof; or a hydrogen atom, a nitrogen-containing group that containing 1-50 nitrogen or carbon atoms with the nitrogen directly-connect to the main ring structure, and a combination thereof. In an embodiment herein, R,~R; together with the main ring structure are derivatives of coumarin or rhodamine. It is believed that by changing R,~Rs, the obtained coumarin or rhodamine derivatives can be tuned to present various photo properties (e.g. different excitation and emission wave- lengths). Accordingly, the various treatment objectives, the hoto properties and photooxidation properties of the plat- inum(IV) complexes may be tuned by choosing the appro- priate derivatives. For example, for skin cancer treatment, latinum(IV) complexes with relatively shorter excitation wavelength may be preferred, since the shorter wavelength ight possesses higher energy, which could activate the Pt(IV) complexes more effectively as deep penetration is not needed for areas closer to the skin surface; whereas for ladder cancer treatment, platinum(IV) complexes with lon- ger excitation wavelength is preferred, because the tumor will typically be located deeper in the body; therefore a longer wavelength light with better tissue penetration may required. Some examples of coumarin and rhodamine derivatives useful herein and their excitation wavelengths\n\n(Ex) are provided below:\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\n-continued FE F CN oe oe Ex = 600 nm Qa /\n\nEx = 470 nm (one photon excitation) 880 nm (two photon excitation)\n\nEx = 712 nm\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\nEx =779 nm\n\n[0074] In Formula I, L is a linker unit which connects the platinum-containing portion and the aromatic portion. In an embodiment herein, the linker is selected from the group of a conjugated carbon ring containing structure with the total carbon number less than 26, a Ca.io carbon chain, and a combination thereof; or at least one electron-donating moi- ety.\n\n[0075] In Formula I, n indicates the charge of the complex, and may be zero (0), a positive charge, or a negative charge; zero or a positive charge; or an integer from -2 to 4; zero.\n\nor\n\nor\n\n[0076] \u2018The present invention provides a novel class of platinum(IV) complexes. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that these complexes are photo-oxidants that can be used as drugs and prodrugs; or prodrugs, and effectively activated by near-infrared radiation (NIR) for the treatment of diseases, especially cancer and bacterial infec- tion. Compared with other UV or visible light photoactivat- able drugs and prodrugs, the invented current platinum(IV) complexes may be activated by a low-dose of NIR to release platinum(I]) drugs. It is believed that by using NIR instead of, for example, UV light, to activate the platinum(IV) complexes herein, the treatment and use possesses signifi- cantly increased penetration depth, and/or decreased photo- toxicity. As the present platinum(IV) complexes are strong photo-oxidants, it is believed that they may oxidize biomo- Jecules to further enhance their anticancer and antibacterial efficiency.\n\n[0077] Furthermore, as compared to, for example, typical chemotherapy drugs, it is believed that the present com- plexes may be controllably activated in or near, for example, a tumor, a cancerous tissue, a cancerous region, an infection, etc. by NIR irradiation so as to reduce the side effects and damage to cells other parts of the subject. Upon photoacti- vation, the present complexes may effectively oxidize intra- cellular biomolecules such as proteins and lipids, and/or disrupt the intracellular redox hemostasis to eliminate cancer cells. By doing so, the invention herein effectively over- comes the resistance of cancer cells towards conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Since the present platinum(IV) complexes may directly oxidize intracellular biomolecules, bacteria and/or cancer cells in an oxygen-independent man- ner, they may provide improved biological activity while simultaneously-addressing the limitations of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment have to responding to conven- tional platinum drugs and photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents.\n\n[0078] Embodiments of the present invention related to the preparation of the compounds and complexes herein,\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\ntheir cytotoxicity against various tumors and/or cancer cell lines, and their antibacterial activities. An embodiment of the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one photo-activatable platinum(IV) photo-oxidant and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. It is also believed that an embodiment of the platinum(IV) complex herein may be useful as, for example, an anticancer agent, a photodynamic therapeutic agent, a photo-oxidant and a combination thereof, or an anticancer agent; a photo- dynamic therapeutic agent; or a photo-oxidant.\n\n[0079] Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention are photoactivatable by NIR such as that having a wavelength of from about 700 nanometers (nm) to about 1400 nm; or from about 800 nm to about 1100 nm; or from about 800 nm to 1000 nm. It is believed that when activated by NIR in this range, the platinum(IV) complexes herein; or the photoac- tivatable platinum(IV) prodrugs herein, may provide signifi- cant cytotoxicity against various cancer cells, including platinum drug-resistant cancer cells.\n\nIt is further believed that, as compared with current\n\n[0080]\n\nplatinum drugs, the platinum(IV) complexes herein possess a variety of advantages such as, for example, controllable activation, significant penetration ability, significantly reduced cytotoxicity, and the potential to reduce or even prevent bacteria from developing drug resistance. In addi- tion, as compared with conventional photosensitizers, it is believed that the platinum(IV) complexes herein possess a much longer activation wavelength. It is believed that this advantageously enables them to be used at a greater depth from the photoactivation device, and therefore at a greater tissue depth. This in turn allows improved efficacy and greater penetration capacity. Furthermore, as the present Platinum(IV) complexes do not require oxygen for activa- tion/efficacy, the present complexes may possess biological activity irrespective of whether oxygen is present, even under hypoxia, and thus are more flexible and versatile than existing oxygen-dependent photosensitizers, drugs, and.\n\nprodrugs.\n\n[0081] It is also believed that as the present platinum(IV) complexes may become strong oxidants upon photoexcita- tion so they may also robustly destroy components such as, for example, lipopolysaccharides or proteins such as those in a bacterial cell wall (if present) and/or a bacterial cell membrane so as to lyse and kill the bacteria. It is further\n\nbelieved that the\n\npresent platinum(IV) complexes may attack intracellular survival-related biomolecules, such as DNA, glutathione (GSH), and hemin, etc. Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that as the present platinum(IV) complexes aim to damage bacterial cell walls and membranes, they will not create or lead to cross- resistance with conventional antibiotics. Therefore, it is believed that the present invention may overcome certain barriers for conventional APDT agents. It is believed that the complexes herein may damage multiple, many or even all biological components of the cell membrane, we can spe- cifically activate complexes in the tumor region by irradia- tion this region with NIR light. Also, these complexes can be further conjugated with tumor-targeting groups, such as antibody or tumor-targeting peptides, to enhance the tumor- targeting ability.) Thus it is understood that the present platinum(IV) complexes may be generally classified as a\n\nalso\n\ndrug; or [0082]\n\na prodrug. In an embodiment herein, the power of the NIR\n\nas\n\nmay be from about 0.01 W/cm? to about 4 W/em?; or from about 0.1 W/cm? to about 2 W/cm\u201d; or from about 0.2 W/cm? to about 0.8 W/em?, as this range is considered strong enough to both penetrate and activate the complexes herein, while also being safe for use on tissues, such as human tissues to reach the platinum(IV) complexes lying under the skin. In an embodiment herein, the power source selected from the group of a continue-wavelength laser, a ulsed laser, and a combination thereof. In an embodiment herein, the pulsed laser has an emission frequency higher than 1 MHz. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that as such NIR may be applied externally, and as NIR may be less damaging than, for example, UV light, which, due to its short wavelength and high energy, may otentially cause, for example, cancer, genetic damage, etc. Thus, unlike other photoactivatable prodrugs, which are activated by UV or visible light, it is believed that the present platinum(IV) complexes are suitable for use as drugs and/or prodrugs that can be activated by low-dosed near- infrared radiation (e.g., 880 nm, 0.4 W/cm?). Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the use of NIR in the present invention may significantly improve the penetration depth during treatment and/or decrease pho-\n\nis\n\ntotoxicity from irradiation.\n\n[0083] In an embodiment herein, the platinum(IV) is selected from the group of:\n\nplex\n\ncom-\n\nFomula II(a)\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\n-continued\n\nfe) rt\n\n;\n\n\\ CNV 2 \\ fe) oO fo) \u4e86 N -\u4e00 \u4e00 / \u516d fo) fo) oo HN > ; HBN byo O\n\n\u570b\n\nand\n\n7\n\nFormula\n\nII(b)\n\nFormula\n\nII(e)\n\nFormula\n\nIICd)\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\n[0084] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing a platinum(IV) complex; or a platinum(IV) complex as described herein. The pharmaceutical composition may further contain an ingredient selected from the group of, for example, an additional anti-cancer agent, an adjuvant, an antibody, a binder, a buffer, a diluent, a filler, a pharmaceutically- acceptable carrier, a preservative, a surfactant, a contrast media, a radioactive agent, a photodynamic therapy agent, a photothermal therapy agent, an ultrasonic therapy agent, and a combination thereof; or an additional anti-cancer agent, an antibody, an adjuvant, a buffer, a pharmaceutically-accept- able carrier, and a combination thereof, or an antibody, a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier and a combination thereof, as well as other pharmaceutical components known in the art.\n\n[0085] In an embodiment herein, the antibody, peptide, and specifical tumor/bacteria targeting groups useful herein may, for example, linked to the platinum(IV) complex herein and may also be targeted against the cancer, tumor, or infection/bacteria. Thus, it is believed that the platinum(IV) complex herein will be drawn to and/or concentrated at the location of the cancer, tumor and/or infection, so as to enhance its effectiveness during use.\n\n[0086] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of manufacturing the platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(a) according to the steps of providing c,c,t-[Pt (DACH)(OH),(0x)], providing a N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of 3-((4-(3-(7-(diethylamino)-2-oxochroman-3- yl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)(methyl)amino)propanoic acid, and reacting c,c,t-[Pt(DACH)(OH),(0x)] with the NHS ester of 3-((4-(3-(7-(diethylamino)-2-oxochroman-3-yl)-3- oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)(methyl)amino)propanoic acid to form the platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(a).

The mechanism of action of some platinum(IV) complexes further analyzed.\n\nis\n\n[0090] Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that platinum(IV) complexes are their highest oxi- dation state (at or higher than 1.23 V) and since they cannot be further oxidized, they are more likely to be reduced after photoexcitation. Furthermore, while other metal complexes (e.g., Ru, Ir, and Rh) which may also exhibit photooxidation ability at their highest oxidation state, it has been found that platinum(IV) complexes containing two axial ligands are easily functionalized. Consequently, during the photoreduc- tion of the platinum(IV) complexes herein, the two axial ligands will typically be released, making the platinum(IV) complexes more flexible to design with multifunctional prodrugs. Accordingly, in an embodiment herein, the releas- able ligand may itself possess anti-cancer and/or drug activ- ity.\n\n[0091] In addition, several platinum complexes have been approved as anticancer drugs for clinical treatments, thus otentially-reducing regulatory hurdles. In particular, it is elieved that the present designed NIR light-activatable platinum(IV) complexes may also serve as prodrugs to controllably release the clinical drugs for precise and directed treatment. Therefore, it is believed that platinum (IV) complexes are especially suited as NIR activatable rodrugs for the treatment and/or elimination of cancer cells and/or infection such as that caused by bacteria through the release of clinical drugs and/or photooxidation.\n\n[0092] Therefore it is understood that upon activation with NIR, photoexcitation causes the present platinum(IV) com- exes to transform into strong oxidants, which can subse- quently oxidize intracellular biomolecules, such as proteins and lipids, generate ROS, lipid peroxides, and protons. Upon exposure to NIR, it is believed that these platinum(IV) complexes may easily oxidize surrounding molecules and may be reduced to platinum(ID, releasing the two axial ligands. Most intracellular biomolecules, such as protein and lipids are easily oxidized; therefore, during this photo- reduction progress it is believed that the existing intracel- lular biomolecules can serve as the electron donors and be oxidized, leading to the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxides, and protons which may further inhibit and/or attack cancer, the infection, bacteria, etc.\n\n[0093] The ROS and oxidized lipid may disrupt the cell\u2019s intracellular redox balance, trigger intense oxidative stress to initiate cell death, and/or cause the protons to break intracellular pH homeostasis so as to synergistically kill cancer cells and overcome traditional drug resistance. At the same time, it is believed that these complexes will be reduced and release the photo-sensitive ligands and platinum. (ID drug. It is believed that the platinum(II) drug may serve as PDT agents to further enhance the therapeutic effect.\n\n[0094] In an embodiment herein the method of manufac- turing a platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(b) contains the steps of providing a platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(a), providing an NHS ester of 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (Le., ligand 3), and reacting the platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(a) with the NHS ester of 5,6-dimethylxanthe- none-4-acetic acid to form the platinum(IV) complex of\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\nFormula II(b).

Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that this manufacturing method is efficient, easy, and scalable.\n\n[0096] In an embodiment herein, a method for manufac- turing a platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(d) contains the steps of providing the platinum(IV) complex of Formula Il(c), providing a NHS ester of 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4- acetic acid:\n\n[0097] The platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(c) reacts with the NHS ester of 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid to form the platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(d). Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that this manufacturing method is efficient, easy, and scalable.\n\n[0098] In an embodiment herein, the complex according to Formula I may include, for example, derivatives of salicy- laldehyde, acetoacetic acid, ethyl acetate, derivatives of 3-oxobutanoate (e.g. methyl 3-oxobutanoate and phenyl 3-oxobutanoate), platinum(II) drugs and complexes (e.g. cisplatin, nedaplatin, and heptaplatin), anhydride derivatives (e.g. succinic anhydride), halogen, and carboxyl acid deriva- tives. We note that the ligands herein may be directly- attached to the platinum(IV) atom (i.e., equatorial ligands), or may be attached to the atoms or moieties attached to the platinum atom (i.e., axial ligands).\n\n[0099] Without intending to be limited by theory it is also believed that an embodiment of the present invention may provide a method for treating cancer, a tumor, or an infection in a subject. In an embodiment herein such a method includes the steps of administering to the subject an effective dose of the platinum(IV) complex according to Formula I, and administering to the subject near-infrared radiation (NIR), typically the NIR is administered to the subject from the outside of the body while the platinum(IV) is located. and/or where the cancer, tumor, or infection is treated in Vivo.\n\na\n\n[0100] Thus, the cancer, tumor, or infection is typically sub-dermal location in the subject. In an embodiment herein, the sub-dermal location is from about 0.01 cm about 2 cm; or from about 0.05 cm to about 1 cm away from\n\nin\n\nto\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\nthe\n\nirradiation site;\n\nthe\n\nunder\n\nirradiation\n\nsite.\n\nIn\n\nor\n\nembodiment herein, where the cancer, tumor, or infection is deep within the subject (i-e., more than about 2 cm below the surface of the skin, then an optical fiber; or a laparoscopic optical fiber, may be employed to deliver the NIR to the sub-dermal location.\n\nan\n\n[0101] As the effective dose of a medication is often dependent upon the weight of the patient/subject, in an embodiment herein, the effective dose is from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 90 mg/kg; or from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 60 mg/kg; or from about 1.5 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, based on the weight of the patient.\n\n[0102] It has also been found that the present invention may be especially effective in subjects where the cancer or the tumor exhibits cisplatin resistance, platinum resistance, hhotodynamic therapy (PDT) resistance, etc. and thus, in an embodiment herein, the composition, treatment and/or method herein is directed towards a subject having a cancer or tumor exhibiting cisplatin resistance, platinum resistance, DT resistance, and a combination thereof. In an embodi- ment herein, the cancer or tumor is of a cancer selected from the group of breast cancer, peritoneal cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and a combination thereof; or ovarian cancer, as these have been shown to sometimes exhibit platinum resistance\n\n[0103] It has also been found that the platinum(IV) com- exes herein may also be useful in treating a bacterial infection; or a bacterial infection caused by bacteria selected from Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and a combination thereof; or Gram-positive bacteria.\n\n[0104] In an embodiment herein, the invention herein may used in conjunction with, for example, radiotherapy, ultrasonic therapy, immune therapy, gene therapy, etc. and combinations thereof so as to enhance the effectiveness of the treatments.\n\n[0105] Alternatively, an embodiment of the invention relates to the use of a platinum(IV) complex according to Formula I in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer, a tumor, an infection, and a combination thereof, in a subject.
