FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0002] The present invention relates to methods of ing a single-layer of rhenium disulfide (ReS,); and more particularly, to methods of forming a controlled wrinkle pattern of single-layer ReS, on a substrate.\n\nform-\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART\n\nIn recent years, two-dimensional transition metal\n\n[0003]\n\ndichalcogenide (TMDc), as an emerging two-dimensional material, has high carrier mobility, mechanical flexibility, chemical stability and photosensitivity, and is an ideal candidate material for future flexible electronic, optoelec- tronic and photovoltaic devices. Two-dimensional ReS, is preferred over other TMDc materials for its highly sym- metrical structure. It has the characteristics of distorted 1T phase and in-plane anisotropy. Meanwhile, it keeps direct bandgap with increasing thickness due to interlayer decou- pling property. These characteristics make it not only suit- able for electronics and photovoltaics field like other two- dimensional materials, it also has great development potential in the fields of flexible devices, anisotropic pho- todetectors and integrated polarization controllers that are\n\nsensitive to polarized light.\n\n[0004] At present, the single-layer ReS, is usually pro- duced by mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapor depo- sition (CVD), however, the mechanical exfoliation can only produce a limited number of single-layer ReS, that is rela- tively small in size. For the preparation of large-scale single-layer ReS,, the CVD method is favored over the mechanical exfoliation. Further, existing methods for modu- lating the structure of 2-D materials are usually complicated, and there are few reports on the structure modulated single- layer ReS,.\n\n[0005] The present disclosure aims to provide a modulated structure of single-layer ReS, by use of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, such structure has a wide potential application in optics, electrics, mechanics, sensor etc.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0006] Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods of forming substrates independently having a wrinkle pattern of a single-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS,) nanoflakes, and such substrates may serve as an optic, an electronic device, a mechanical sensor etc. The objective of the present disclosure therefore is to provide a method of producing a substrate having a wrinkle pattern of a single- layer rhenium disulfide (ReS,) nanoflakes deposited thereon in a reaction chamber, in which the reaction chamber has a\n\nDec. 29, 2022\n\ntubular body having first and second temperature zones, and first and second containers, and the method includes steps of:\n\n[0007] (a) placing sulfur powders in the first container; [0008] (b) placing ammonium perrhenate evenly in the second container;\n\n[0009] (c) covering the evenly placed ammonium perrhe- nate of step (b) with a plurality of molecular sieves;\n\n[0010] (d) mounting the substrate above the plurality of molecular sieves of step (c);\n\n[0011] (ce) placing the first container of step (a) and the second container of step (d) into the tube furnace, in which the first and second containers are respectively under the first and second temperature zones,\n\n[0012] (\u00a3) purging the reaction chamber of the step (e) with an inert gas, in which the inert gas flows from the first temperature zone towards the second temperature zone;\n\n[0013] (g) subjecting the reaction chamber in a heating program, in which the temperature in the first temperature zone is raised from room temperature to 200\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept for 10 minutes, while the temperature in the second temperature zone is raised from room tempera- ture to 600-950\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept for 10 minutes;\n\n[0014] (h) allowing the temperature of the second tem- zone to cool down to 600\u00b0 C.;\n\nperature (1 cooling the reaction chamber to\n\n[0015] room tempera- ture thereby depositing the single-layer ReS, nanoflakes on the substrate; and\n\n[0016] (j) irradiating the substrate of step (i) with ultra- violet (UV) light until the single-layer ReS, nanoflakes deposited thereon forms the wrinkle pattern.\n\n[0017] According to embodiments of the present disclo- sure, the sulfur powders in the first container and the ammonium perrhenate in the second container are present in a ratio of 10:1 by weight. In one preferred embodiment, the sulfur powders, and the ammonium perrhenate are present in the ratio of 7:1 by weight.\n\n[0018] Examples of the substrate suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, a mica substrate, a sapphire substrate, and the like.\n\n[0019] Examples of the inert gas suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, argon, and the like.

However, it is to be understood that the descriptions and the accompanying drawings dis- closed herein are merely illustrative and exemplary and not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.\n\n[0040] Embodiments of the present disclosure include improved methods of producing a substrate having a wrinkle pattern of single-layer ReS, formed thereon, such a substrate may be used, for example, in the field of electronic devices, photovoltaic devices, optoelectronic devices etc. Methods in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure are advantageously simple, easy-to-use, and pollution-free, thus\n\nDec. 29, 2022\n\nare suitable for producing substrates having desired trolled wrinkle patterns of single-layer ReS, in large scale.\n\ncon-\n\n[0041] The present method is characterized in forming a wrinkle pattern of single-layer of ReS, on a substrate in a controlled manner, thereby producing substrates suitable for wide range applications in large scale. To this purpose, an atomic crystal layer of ReS, (Le., single-layer of ReS,) is first formed on a substrate via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a reaction chamber (e.g., a tube furnace), and then the substrate is exposed to ultraviolet light at conditions suitable for forming a controlled wrinkle pattern structure.\n\n[0042] Reference is made to FIG. 1A, which is schematic diagram of a tube furnace 100 suitable for implementing the present method. The tube furnace 100 includes in its struc- ture, at least, a tubular body 110; and first and second containers 120a, 1206 independently for housing reactants necessary for the formation of single-layer of ReS,, includ- ing but is not limited to, the rhenium source, and the sulfur source. Further, the first and second containers 120a, 1205 are disposed within the tubular body 110, with the first container 120a being upstream to the second container 1205. The tubular body 110 has first and second temperature zones 1304, 1305, in which each temperature zone may be set at same or different temperatures. Note that in the present disclosure, each temperature zone refers to a certain section of the tubular body 110 coupled to at least, a heater and a temperature sensor (not visible from FIG. 1A), to bring the temperature of that certain section of the tubular body 110 to any pre-designated value during deposition of ReS,.\n\n[0043] Reference is now made to FIG. 1B, which depicts the tube furnace 100 of FIG. 1A in operation. The present method commences from placing a sufficient amount of sulfur powders 150 in the first container 120a, while at the same time, placing a sufficient amount of ammonium per- rhenate 160 evenly at the bottom of the second container 1206, then covering the evenly placed ammonium perrhen- ate 160 with a plurality of molecular sieves 170, finally, mounting a substrate 140 above the molecular sieves 170 without direct contacting them. Preferably, the sulfur pow- ders 150 in the first container 120q and the ammonium perrhenate 160 in the second container 120\u00e9 are present in aratio of 10:1 by weight, such as 10:1, 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1; more preferably, the sulfur powders 150, and the ammonium perrhenate 160 are present in the ratio of 7:1 by weight. Further, the plurality of molecular sieves 170 (e.g., 4 A spherical molecular sieves) are crushed into pieces via use of a mortar. Examples of the substrate suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, a mica substrate, a sapphire substrate etc.\n\n[0044] The first and second container 120a, 1206 are then placed into the tubular body 110 of the tube furnace 100, in which the first and second containers 120a, 1200 are respec- tively under the first and second temperature zones 130a, 1304, so that they may be subsequently subjected to heating programs for the deposition of ReS,. Prior to commencing the heating programs, the tubular body 110 is purged with an inert gas to completely replace air therein with the inert gas. Examples of the inert gas suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, helium, nitrogen, argon, etc. Preferably, the tubular body 110 is purged with argon, in which the argon flows from upstream to down- stream of the tubular body 110, that is, from the first temperature zone 130a towards the second temperature zone 1305. According to embodiments of the present disclosure,\n\nUS 2022/0411965 Al\n\nthe tubular body 110 is purged with argon at a flow rate of 50-100 cm?/min, such as 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 cm*/min, more preferably, the tube furnace 100 is purged with argon at the flow rate of 80 cm*/min.\n\n[0045] The tube furnace 100, in which the first and second container 120\u00a2, 1205 are respectively under the first and second temperature zones 130a, 130d, is then subjected to heating programs. Upon commencing the heating programs, the temperature in the first temperature zone 130a is raised from room temperature to about 200\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 200\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes; while the tempera- ture in the second temperature zone 1306 is raised from room temperature to 600-950\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 600-950\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes. The heating programs described herein will cause vaporization of the materials respectively housed in the first and second containers 120a, 1205 (e.g., sulfur powders, and ammonium perrhenate), the vaporized materials are subsequently deposited on the sur- face of the substrate 140 mounted in the second container 120b when the tube furnace, particularly, the second tem- perature zone 130h, is cooled, thereby forming the desired single-layer ReS,. According to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, the temperature in the first tempera- ture zone 130a is raised from room temperature to about 200\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 200\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes; while the temperature in the second temperature zone 130d is raised from room temperature to 850\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 850\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes. After the heating program, let the temperature in the second tempera- ture zone 1306 returns slowly and naturally to 600\u00b0 C., while the temperature of the tube furnace 100 returns quickly (Le within about 5 minutes) to room temperature, thereby result- ing the deposition of ReS, on the substrate 140. According to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, the thus deposited ReS, is highly crystalline and has a thickness about 0.7 nm, which indicates that the ReS, deposited by the\n\npresent method is in single-layer structure. Then, the substrate 140 having a single-layer of\n\n[0046]\n\nReS, deposited thereon is taken out of the tube furnace 110 and placed into a chamber equipped with ultraviolet (UV) lights. Preferably, the chamber is equipped with two UV lamps respectively set to emit UV lights at the wavelengths of 254 nm and 185 nm; more preferably, the UV light of 185 nm accounts only about 10% of the total UV light in the chamber. According to embodiments of the present disclo- sure, the substrate 140 is irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in the chamber described above in the condition where humidity is about 30-80% (e.g., 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% humidity), and in the presence of an inert gas (e.g., N,, argon, etc) for a period of 60-450 seconds (e.g., 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, or 450 seconds) to induce formation of the desired wrinkle patter on the single-layer of ReS,. In one preferred embodiment, the irradiation is performed in the chamber described above at a humidity level of 60% in the presence of nitrogen for about 180 seconds to indued wrinkles on the single-layer of ReS,. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, increasing exposure time to UV lights and/or humidity level will produce much denser wrinkle pattern structure and lower photoluminescence (PL) inten- sity. Such substrate, that is, the substrate having a wrinkle\n\npattern of single-layer of ReS, thereon prepared in accor-\n\nDec. 29, 2022\n\ndance with the method described above, may be used, for example, in the field of electronic devices, photovoltaic devices, optoelectronic devices etc.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1: Preparation of a Mica Substrate Having a Wrinkle Pattern of Single-layer ReS, Deposited Thereon\n\n[0047] In this example, a mica substrate having a wrinkle pattern of a single-layer ReS, deposited thereon was pre- pared in a quartz tube furnace like the one depicted in FIG. 1, which comprised two heating areas respectively termed as temperature zones I and II.\n\n1.1 Deposition of Single-layer ReS, on a Mica Substrate\n\nin a\n\nTo this\n\nboat B, placed ammo-\n\n[0048]\n\npurpose, quartz nium perrhenate powders (15 mg) evenly, and covered them with crushed pieces of 4 A spherical molecular sieves, a mica substrate (about 1 em? in size) was then mounted on the quartz boat B without contacting the molecular sieves. After that, the quartz boat B was put into the quartz tube furnace and was under the temperature zone II. At the same time, sulfur powders (100 mg) were placed inside a quartz boat A, which was then put into the quartz tube furnace and was under the temperature zone J. A flow of argon gas (300 cm\u2019/min, 10 minutes) was injected into the quartz tube furnace to fully replace the air therein, then, the flow rate of argon was reduced to 80 cm?/min. Then, the quartz tube furnace was heated to raise the temperature in the tempera- ture zone II from room temperature to 850\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at it for 10 minutes; while the temperature in the temperature zone I was raised from room temperature to 200\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at it for 10 minutes. After heating, let temperature zone I] cooled down to 600\u00b0 C., and quickly cooled down temperature I to room temperature to produce the monolayer ReS, nanoflakes. Results are pro-\n\nvided in FIGS. 2 to 4.\n\n[0049] FIG. 2 is the photograph showing numerous ReSz nanoflakes deposited on the mica substrate, while FIG. 3 is the Raman spectrum of the ReS, nanoflakes in FIG. 2, in which the characteristic peaks of ReS, could be easily identified therefrom, which was an indication of the forma- tion of highly crystalline ReS,. FIG. 4 is an atomic force microscope image of ReS, nanoflakes on the mica substrate, in which the ReS, nanoflakes thus formed was about 0.7 nm in thickness, indicating that the ReS, nanoflakes were indeed in a single-layer structure.\n\n1,2 Forming a Wrinkle Pattern on the Single-layer ReS, of Example 1.1\n\n[0050] The mica substrate of Example 1.1 was placed in a chamber equipped with two UV light sources. Then, the humidity in the reaction chamber was adjusted to be around 60% via use of a humidifier and inert gas (e.g., N2). Then, the mica substrate was irradiated with the two UV lights respectively set to emit UV lights of 254 nm and 185 nm, in which the energy ratio of the UV light emitting 185 nm was about 10%. The wrinkle pattern structure started to appear after irradiating for about 180 seconds (FIG. 5).\n\nUS 2022/0411965 Al\n\nExample 2: Preparation of a Sapphire Substrate Having a Wrinkle Pattern of Single-layer ReS2 Deposited Thereon\n\n[0051] In this example, a substrate having a wrinkle pat- tern of a single-layer ReS, deposited thereon was prepared in accordance with the procedures described in Example 1, except a sapphire substrate (about 1 cm? in size) was used to replace the mica substrate. Results are provided in FIGS. 6 to 8.\n\n[0052] FIG. 6 is the photograph showing numerous ReS> nanoflakes deposited on the sapphire substrate, while FIG. 7 is the Raman spectrum of the ReS, nanoflakes in FIG. 6, in which the characteristic peaks of ReS, could be easily identified therefrom, which was an indication of the forma- tion of highly crystalline ReS,. Atomic force microscope image of ReS, nanoflakes on the sapphire substrate indicated that the ReS, nanoflakes thus formed was indeed in a single-layer structure (data not shown). The wrinkle pattern structure started to appear after the sapphire substrate had been irradiated with UV lights for about 180 seconds (FIG. 8).\n\nExample 3: Effects of UV exposure time or humidity level on the wrinkle pattern of the substrates of Examples 1 or 2\n\n3.1 UV Exposure Time\n\n[0053] The monolayer ReS, flakes grown on mica sub- strate by CVD method as mentioned in Example 1.1 was transferred to SiO>/Si substrate and then was irradiated with ultraviolet lights emitted from two light sources of 254 nm and 185 nm, in which the energy of 185 nm ultraviolet light accounted for 10%, and the ReS, flake was irradiated for 30 s, 90 s, 180 s, 300 s, or 450 s, and the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was recorded. Results are provided in FIG. 9. According to the data depicted in FIG. 9, the PL intensity of ReS, substrate significantly decreased with an increase in the UV exposure time, which indicated changes in the optical property of the monolayer ReS, formed on the mica substrate of Example 1.1.\n\n[0054] Similarly, the PL intensity of ReS, formed on sapphire substrate of Example 2.1 also decreased signifi- cantly with an increase in the UV exposure time, which indicated changes in the optical property of the monolayer ReS, (FIG. 10)\n\n3.2 Humidity Level\n\n[0055] In this example, effect of the humidity level during UV irradiation on the wrinkle pattern of single-layer ReS, formed on the mica substrate of Example 1.1 was investi- gated. To this purpose, the mica substrate of Example 1.1 was irradiated with ultraviolet lights emitted from two light sources of 254 nm and 185 nm, in which the energy of 185 nm ultraviolet light accounted for 10%, and the ReS, flake was irradiated for 180 seconds at the humidity level of 30% or 80%, and the atomic force microscopy images were respectively taken. Results are provided in FIG. 11.\n\n[0056] According to the photos provided in FIG. 11, when irradiation was performed at higher humidity level (Le 80%), it gave a much wrinkle pattern structure as compared that at lower humidity level (i.e., 30%).\n\nto\n\n[0057] It will be understood that the above description embodiments is given by way of example only and\n\nof that\n\nDec. 29, 2022\n\nvarious modifications may be made by those with ordinary skill in the art. The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the structure and use of exemplary embodiments of the invention.
