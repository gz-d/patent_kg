While notable progress has been made in the design and manufacturing of various hierarchical materials, the state-of-the-art approaches suffer from limited materials selection, high costs, as well as low processing throughput. Herein, by harnessing the configurable elastic crack engi- neering-controlled formation and configuration of cracks in elastic materials, an effect normally avoided in various industrial processes, the present invention provides a facile and powerful technique to enable the faithful transfer of arbitrary hierarchical structures with broad material com- patibility and structural and functional integrity. The present invention provides a cost-effective, large-scale production method of a variety of flexible, inexpensive, and transparent 3D hierarchical and biomimetic materials.\n\n(21) Appl.

More par- ticularly, it relates to a method of fabricating three-dimen- sional (3D) hierarchical structures by harnessing the con- figurable elastic crack engineering.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nthe fundamental elements of numerous biological surfaces that exhibit various fascinating functionalities useful for liquid and mass transport, energy conversion, signal trans- formation, and topological interaction, etc. In recent years, extensive efforts have been directed towards mimicking these natural inspirations for practical applications. While breakthroughs in bio-inspired engineering have created a wide range of structures that enable various fascinating functionalities, these achievements remain conceptual because of the daunting challenge in creating desired hier- archical structures at affordable cost, in large scale, and/or with desired material. Generally, pre-designed hierarchical structures can only be prototyped using expensive and sophisticated technologies (that is, the standard MEMS process and/or two-photon 3D printing technologies). These methods are limited by very low throughput and very high cost, and are applicable to only a few materials, e.g., Si and photoresist. As a result, the created rigid structures inevita- bly suffer from limited structural durability, flexibility, and optical transparency, not to mention the unaffordable cost, thereby preventing their broad real-life applications. Thus, it is imperative to develop an affordable and scalable strategy to facilely fabricate hierarchical structures and increase the\n\n[0005] In one embodiment of the present invention, the three-dimensional hierarchical structure comprises a closed- loop structure, a doubly reentrant structure, an arch, a high aspect ratio rod, a high aspect ratio two-cycle helix, or a 3D array.\n\none the present invention, elastomer mold has a cracking coeflicient 1 of at least 100% and a deformation coeflicient @ during the first phase, and 1/\u00ae is equal to or greater than g, and \u00a2 is the ultimate elongation at break of the elastomer mold.\n\n[0007] In one embodiment of the present invention, cracking coefficient is computed by:\n\n=F nin\n\nwhere Www is the smallest width of a neck region; his the height of the locked region, and 2 pm<h<15 pm.\n\n[0008] In one embodiment of the present invention, the deformation coeflicient is computed by:\n\n\u9084 \u6240 oa \u6240 ae\n\nwhere Wu is the smallest width of a neck region; Wo is the largest width near the locked region.\n\n[0009] In one embodiment of the present invention, the elastomer mold has a local stress lower than a failure strength of the elastomer mold during fabricating.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0003] Accordingly, the objective of this invention relates to three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical morphologies widely exist in natural and biomimetic materials, which impart preferential functions including liquid and mass transport, energy conversion, and signal transmission for various applications. While notable progress has been made in the design and manufacturing of various hierarchical materials, the state-of-the-art approaches suffer from limited materials selection, high costs, as well as low processing throughput. Herein, by harnessing the configurable elastic crack engi- neering\u2014controlled formation and configuration of cracks in elastic materials\u2014an effect normally avoided in various industrial processes, the inventors report the development of a facile and powerful technique that enables the faithful transfer of arbitrary hierarchical structures with broad mate- rial compatibility and structural and functional integrity.\n\n[0010] In one embodiment of the present invention, replica material comprises a base material or an engineering material.\n\n[0011] In one embodiment of the present invention, the base material comprises silicon and a photoresist.\n\n[0012] In one embodiment of the present invention, the engineering material comprises a polymer or a printable material.\n\n[0013] In one embodiment of the present invention, the printable material comprises SiO,, a metal, or a ceramic.\n\n[0014] In one embodiment of the present invention, the polymer comprises a UV curable resin, a thermoset, a thermoset metal, and a thermoplastic.\n\n[0015] In one embodiment of the present invention, the thermoplastic comprises low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), Poly(methyl meth- acrylate) (PMMA), polyurethan (PU), polycarbonate (PC), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymers (ABS).\n\n[0004] In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of fabricating and mass-producing a three-dimensional hierarchical structure. The method com- prises a first phase and a second phase. The first phase includes using a three-dimensional hierarchical structure as a master structure; enclosing the master structure in an elastomer mold, where a Young\u2019s modulus of the elastomer mold is at least one order of magnitude lower than a Young\u2019s\n\n[0002]\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures are\n\nmaterials diversity for smart interfacial materials.\n\nmodulus of the master\n\nthe master struc-\n\n[0006]\n\nIn\n\nembodiment of\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nApr. 29 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0122091 A1\n\n2\n\nin PDMS ( Phase II ) .

In striking contrast to conventional wis- dom, the inventors demonstrate that the previously strictly avoided detrimental crack phenomenon can be translated. into a powerful tool to achieve structures and functions that are otherwise impossible to realize even using state-of-art facilities. The inventors\u2019 innovation lies in that elastomer materials are associated with a high level of configurability by virtue of their elastic deformation characteristics; effec- tively controlling the cracking in elastic materials and sub- sequently configuration of the elastic crack can pave a road for 3D replication. The inventors demonstrated that this approach can realize faithful mass-production of various functional hierarchical structures reported before that could only be made at very small scale in silicon or photoresist only. The inventors name this new approach configurable, elastic crack engineering (CECE)-assisted molding, which is breakthrough in microfabrication technology, as it greatly extends the range of 3D micro-processible materials to broadly used structural plastics and other shapeable mate- rials, as well as tremendously reduced the production cost (by the order of 10\u00b04) and increased the production scope and throughput. The inventors\u2019 work paves the way for the cost-effective, large-scale production of a variety of flexible, inexpensive, and transparent 3D hierarchical and biomi-\n\n[0054] FIG. 5B shows the mechanical property of PDMS produced with different mixing ratios and different curing levels when the tensile stress-strain behavior of PDMS cured at 25\u00b0 C. for 12 h and then baked at 150\u00b0 C. for 30 min.

Based on systematic experiments and simulation, the inven- tors demonstrate that when the mechanical property of the elastomer is dynamically changed in a certain way, it is possible to control the formation and configuration of cracks in an elastomer, and use it as a mold to realize faithful replication of 3D hierarchical structures. The inventors investigated the mechanic and geometric effects on the crack formation and the critical forces to manipulate the elastic cracks, thus, providing general guides for the master design and the material options. With the full understanding of the physics of elastic cracks, the inventors have created novel functions in fabrication with previously strictly avoided cracking phenomenon. Notably, the replication of 3D hier- archical structures using configurable cracks has never been\n\ndirected towards reproduction of these representative archi- tectures, which is of importance to the creation of a wide spectrum of biomimetic and smart materials for practical applications. While breakthroughs in bio-inspired engineer- ing have achieved a wide range of structures that enable various fascinating functionalities, it remains a daunting challenge to mimic structural hierarchy, material diversity, and functional sophistication of living organisms in a facile and reproducible manner. So far, these exquisite morpholo- gies are generally achieved on rigid materials such as polystyrene (PS) and silicon using expensive and sophisti- cated microfabrication technologies and/or two-photon 3D printing technologies. More importantly, these rigid engi- neered structures are mechanically vulnerable to external load because of the concentration of high local stress during their deformation, chemically susceptible to corrosives, topologically limited, and optically less attractive, thereby preventing real-life applications. Thus, it is timely to develop affordable and scalable strategies that enable the attainment of structural and functional diversity on more\n\n[0074] Important New Functions of Structured Materials\n\ninventors constructed various flexible and transparent bio- mimetic materials, which could not be made using start-of- art technologies before, and proved their remarkable new functions compared to past reports. Notably, CECE expands the material choices from limited base materials (e.g., Si and photoresist) to a broad range of engineering materials (e.g.\uff0c polymers, and other printable materials including SiO2, metal, ceramic, etc.), therefore, addresses the long-lasting challenge to bio-inspired engineering\u2014the demand of a rational combination of hierarchical structures and base material to achieve diverse properties and functions. The capability of CECE using new materials to fabricate the pre-designed hierarchical structures opens up a broad way to enable new functions of the bio-inspired materials. The inventors demonstrated two impressive examples in the inventors\u2019 work. One example is a 3D hierarchical struc- tured soft membrane mimicking the smart-skin patterns of springtails that show outstanding repellence to various liq- uids; different from previous reports, the inventors are able to make the structures on a flexible membrane with excellent mechanochemical robustness. Another example is the real- ization of flexible and anti-corrosion polymer-based liquid diodes decorated with capillary channels and mushroom structures on various plastics, even on curved surfaces, which could not be realized before due to the limitation in materials selection for conventional silicon processing. The inventors\u2019 work demonstrated the cost-effective, large-scale production of a variety of flexible, inexpensive, robust, and transparent 3D hierarchical and biomimetic materials, which was impossible to achieve before. In this way, CECE enables an unprecedented freedom in the material selection for making bio-inspired materials and the paves the road for\n\ntures, the formation of cracks has normally been avoided due to its detrimental nature. For example, in one of the most commonly used fabrication processes, replication, the inevi- table formation of uncontrolled cracks and subsequent struc- tural failure, as a result of the presence of deadlocking region in the transfer of hierarchical structures. Previous studies have also shown that proper control of crack forma- tion in rigid materials (e.g., hexagonal BN, SiN, Pt, and Si) can give rise to useful functionalities such as atomic-scale pattern formation. Inspired by these studies, the inventors hypothesize that the controllable formation and configur- ability of cracks in elastic materials might be utilized to achieve more diverse structures and functions otherwise impossible to realize using state-of-art facilities. Herein, the inventor develop a new technique, termed as configurable, elastic crack engineering (CECE)-assisted molding, which transforms the detrimental crack effect into a powerful tool for the cost-effective, large-scale fabrication of various hierarchical structures on a wide range of materials. As an immediate implementation, the inventors develop new super-repellant surfaces and liquid diode devices with\n\n[0076] Main Text\n\n[0080] The inventors\u2019 work mainly resorts to the unique features of elastomer materials, i.e., superior elastic defor- mation and a high level of configurability. Elastomers are usually amorphous, and thus tend to randomly crack when subject to stress during the replication process. To suppress the random cracks, the inventors develop a modified soft lithography process (FIG. 1A) that enables the formation of a configurable intermediate state during the casting process. The elastomer material in such an intermediate state fulfills two requirements simultaneously. On hand, it is soft\n\n[0077] Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures are the fundamental elements of numerous biological and arti- ficial surfaces that exhibit various fascinating functionalities useful for liquid and mass transport, adhesion, signal trans- formation, and structural coloration, etc. For instance, many living organisms evolved exquisite structures and functional materials for surviving in harsh environments.

On the other hand, is rigid enough to regain its original shape for the reliable creation of final structures.\n\nmeet two criteria: (1) the crack should be preferentially formed in the PDMS mold rather than in the master. More- over, the crack should develop along the direction of vertical peeling force; (2) the PDMS mold should be able to elasti- cally deform and can be released completely from the closed-loop master. To provide a fundamental guidance for successful 3D replication, the reproducible formation and configuration of the cracks in both Phase I and IT of CECE are studied. In Phase I, the geometry of the master deter- mines the stress distribution in the PDMS, and thereby the eventual location and direction of cracking. To study how the geometric features of masters affect the crack formation, a simple analytical model is provided. As shown in FIG. 2A, a cracking coefficient n=W,,,,,/h is defined to predict the location of the cracking, where W,,,,, is the smallest width of the neck region and h is the height of the locked part. Similarly, to quantify the required maximum deformation of PDMS elastomer for its complete release from the master, it is denoted a deformation coeflicient Q=W,,5/Winaxs Where Wax is the largest width near the locked region. To provide guidance for the rational design of proper master structures, a phase diagram showing the effect of geometric parameters on the crack formation behavior is mapped out (FIG. 2B). The CECE will fail under the following two conditions. (1) when 1<100%, the neck region breaks before the desired. cracking emerges along the direction of peeling force; (2) when 1/p<e (where g is the ultimate elongation of elastomer at break, e=250% for PDMS), the deformation of PDMS goes beyond its limit and as a result the mold cannot be released during the separation process. To validate the present model, a series of PDMS molds were fabricated based on closed-loop masters with various geometries n and. \u00a2. Notably, the cracking behaviors observed in the present invention are consistent with the prediction shown in the phase diagram (FIG. 8A, FIG. 2B). A finite element analysis (FEA) is also performed to further reveal the stress distri- bution in PDMS molds (FIG. 8B). Indeed, an increase in either r or p leads to both stronger stress and higher local deformation near the neck layer; otherwise, the stress dis-\n\nprinciple of CECE, in which a closed-loop structure is used as a master (FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B). Distinct from existing methods, CECE is a two-phase process (FIG. 1A and FIG. 1E) characterized by two curing stages of the elastomer (FIG. 1B and FIG. 5). The images in the upper row of FIG. 1A present the spontaneous formation of a crack in the elastomer in Phase I when the closed loop is peeled off during the preparation of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold of the master structure. The elastomer is cured at low temperature to give rise to a relatively lower density of crosslinking and looser macromolecular packing. The Young's modulus of as-prepared elastomer is more than one order of magnitude lower than that of the closed-loop master microstructure, and at least lower than the latter, which ensures that cracks are developed in the elastomer rather than in the master. During the peeling-off process, cracks are generated along the direction of the vertical peeling force. Since the subsequent molding process involves relatively high pressure, the elastomer mold needs to be self-sealable. Thus, to translate the intermediate elastomer into a mature mold for the creation of 3D structure, an additional curing step at higher temperatures, denoted as Phase II, to enhance the stiffness, self-sealing, and configurability of the elasto- mer is provided. In this way, the crack keeps self-sealing during molding and regains its original shape after this entire process, and the shape and size of the as-formed elastic crack can be dynamically manipulated in Phase II, where a molding process is used to create a replica of the master. On the other hand, Phase I is proven necessary, as without it cracks are randomly formed without the preferred config- urability, which is similar to the case of conventional soft\n\n[0082] To demonstrate the utility of CECE, a master containing an array of closed-loop structures is provided. After the fabrication using two-photon absorption (TPA, FIG. 6A-6B), PDMS is cast into the master (FIG. 1E) to create a soft mold. PDMS was chosen because its curing dynamics can be easily controlled by adjusting the curing temperature and time (FIG. 1B and FIG. 5). The polymer- ization and curing are carefully controlled to induce the crack formation at locked regions in the soft mold during peeling from the closed-loop master. As demonstrated in the SEM images (FIG. 1C), the prepared PDMS in Phase I bears a large deformation and can be completely released from the closed-loop structure. In contrast, as shown in FIG. 6A, without the introduction of Phase I, the cracking was ran- domly formed in PDMS and both master and PDMS mold were damaged during the casting process. Moreover, the crack formed in Phase I can be spontaneously opened (FIG. 1D) in Phase IJ, making it possible to create many replicas based on one mold. On the other hand, without the intro- duction of Phase II the crack formed in Phase I is not stiff enough to self-seal; as shown in FIG. 6B, thin membranes are observed in the replica and blocks the hole of the loop during molding. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the principle of CECE is essential for the successful\n\n[0084] Based on a simple 2D model, it is continued to evaluate the configurability of a sealed crack with a given interfacial area (An) by characterizing the required critical force (F,) to open it (FIG. 2C). A 3D geometric illustration is also provided in FIG. 9A. Briefly, a soft mold was created from a master containing a set of closed-loop structures with fixed height h-15 ym, and different lengths 1. Thus, the interfacial area of the crack can be expressed as A, =hl. The mold was used to create replicas made of materials with various flexural strengths (0). It is imaginable that in the demolding process the replica material has to be stiff enough to endure the drag during releasing through a crack in the mold. The replica loop structure with low o and large 1 were observed to be misshaped because of the drag during releas- ing from the mold through the cracks. Thus, the maximum length of the faithful replicas was measured and recorded as the yield point of the material with specific a (FIG. 9B). At the yield point, the critical force can be expressed as F,=nor\u2018/l, where is the flexural strength of the replica material, and r is the radius of the closed loops (r=2.5 jum). The critical force F, is found to be proportional to A, (that is, or/I~hl) as plotted in FIG. 2D, indicating a good\n\nit\n\n[0081]\n\nFIG. 1A and FIG. 1E schematically illustrate the\n\nlithography process.\n\ncreation of hierarchical structures.\n\n[0083]\n\nThe controlled formation of crack\n\nfor CECE should\n\ntribution and the deformation shift to the bottom layer.\n\nconfigurability of the sealing/opening of the elastic crack.\n\nApr. 29 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0122091 A1\n\n6\n\nwas achieved , which has surpassed most of the previous\n\nThus , for a given elastic crack , the required minimum\n\nworks . a more complicated two - cycle helix structure with\n\nflexural strength of the replica material can be calculated\n\nthrough o hl\u00ba / str for guiding the material option .

The pres- ent invention suggests a lower local stress in the PDMS mold than the failure strength of PDMS during molding (FIG. 10), making the reversible sealing and opening pos- sible without damaging either the mold or the replicas. The failure strength of PDMS during molding is in a range of 2-6 MPa.\n\nworks. a more complicated two-cycle helix structure with high aspect ratio (FIG. 3B) was also successfully replicated. This result nicely demonstrated the remarkable configur- ability of CECE via elastic deformation. To assess the lifespan of the elastic crack, one PDMS mold was used to repeatedly replicate an arch structure for cycles (FIG. 3C). Notably, the structure obtained after 50\u201d cycles is still exactly identical with the master (FIG. 11A-11D), demon- strating the superior robustness of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 3D and 3E, with CECE to the present invention enables creation of structures with nanoscale beams and gaps, even down to 280 nm and 80 nm, respec- tively. Finally, a microbull (FIG. 3F), representing the most complicated arbitrary 3D structures producible using state- of-art techniques, can also be faithfully replicated, revealing the unprecedented capability of CECE and its full compat- ibility to initial prototyping techniques.

Taken together, it is clear that CECE is a unique technique for efficient and scalable\n\nof CECE, a variety of representative 3D hierarchical struc- tures were further replicated (i.e., a beaded probe, a helix, an arch, a multi-beam, a split-ring, and a bull), resembling those emerging architectures with promising functions. The masters of these structures (FIG. 3B-3G) were fabricated using prototyping methods that are expensive, time-consum- ing, and low throughput. These 3D hierarchical structure structures have been proven challenging for replication using existing methods, owing to the presence of multiple pronged nanoscale shapes (i.e., closed loop, reentrant, high- aspect-ratio rods, and 3D arrays).

An artificial superomniphobic surface was first reproduced to mimic the soft, semitrans- parent, and liquid-repellent springtail skin (FIG. 4A). FIG. 4B shows the optical image of the as-fabricated, flexible, transparent polypropylene (PP) surface exhibiting excellent repellency to liquids even including hexane (surface tension: ~18.6 mN/m). In particular, the surface also displays a superior dynamic wetting property as evidenced by the complete rebounding of hexane droplet (FIG. 4C). Such a superior wetting property is ascribed to the presence of pillar arrays decorated with doubly reentrant structures (FIGS. 4D, 4E\uff0cand 4F), which are faithfully transferred from their masters using CECE with the time and cost several orders of magnitude lower than those of standard 3D prototyping methods. Remarkably, owing to its strong flexibility and elastic deformation, these doubly reentrant structures pre- serve their structural integrity and liquid repellence during repeated bending deformation. The bending test was con- ducted by using a buckling device with defined curvatures (k, as illustrated in FIG. 4F) at a frequency of 50 cycles per minute. For water and ultralow-surface tension liquids (e.g.\uff0c ethanol and hexane), no obvious decay in the dynamic wetting property was observed until the buckling cycles are up to 100,000 and 70,000, respectively (FIG. 4G). In con- trast, for the counterparts based on rigid materials, the surfaces are easily broken and their liquid repellences are lost after only several cycles of buckling. These complicated reentrant structures can also be fabricated on other chemi- cally inert materials, e.g., polyethylene (PE), thus offering\n\n[0089] Materials and Methods\n\n[0090] Elastic crack formation. The elastic crack was generated by using modified soft lithography by controlling the curing dynamics of PDMS. First, RTV 615 PDMS (General Electric) was thoroughly mixed in a 10:1 mass ratio of prepolymer to curing agent and degassed in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min. Then, the PDMS mixture was oured on the closed-loop master and cured at room tem- erature (22\u00b0 C.) for 24 h (denoted as Phase I). Note that, PDMS would cure sufficiently in 24 hours at 25\u00b0 C. to permit andling, while the time window for the operation could be extended to 48 h. After that, the elastic crack was formed by carefully peeling off the cured PDMS. The PDMS was then baked for 30 min at 150\u00b0 C. (denoted as Phase II). The temperature was gradually raised up (typically 10\u00b0 C. per minute) from room temperature at the beginning of baking.\n\nprocess. ity of the elastic crack was utilized for replication of true 3D jerarchical structures. The casting step was conducted according to the procedure for the crack formation. Then the PDMS mold was attached on a glass slide for molding thermoplastic plate. The thermoplastic plate was hot-pressed with the PDMS mold at molten state for 1 min under a pressure of ~0.2 MPa. After that, the sandwich was cooled. down to room temperature gradually while the pressure was kept. The product replica was obtained after the PDMS mold. was peeled off.

FIG. 4 shows the morphology of the PE rectifier, which is orderly decorated with capillary channels and reentrant structures (highlighted by the inset of FIG. 41). The liquid diode displays very stable liquid rectification performance even a re \u00b0 fier 6,000 buckling cycles, suggesting its unprecedented \u2018obustness (FIG. 4J). Such a flexible and mechanochemi- ally robust rectifier is potentially suitable for adhering onto complex surfaces\u2014in the form of adhesive tape\u2014for the directional of diverse fluids. CC: c\n\n[0092] Biomimetic materials construction. The doubly reentrant structure was fabricated by TPA and then transfer- printed to PP material (FIG. 12). The liquid repellency was evaluated by testing the rebound of water, ethanol, and hexane droplets under Weber number ~0.5. The contact angles of the droplets were measured when the liquids reach static. The silicon liquid rectifier was fabricated using stan- dard MEMS process, as described elsewhere (3) and then transfer-printed to PE material. The P E liquid rectifier was then treated with air plasma to decrease the apparent contact angles of water to ~15\u00b0. 1-M NaOH aqueous solution was fed onto the surface of the rectifier at a velocity of 20 L/min, and the spreading behavior was recorded with a camera.\n\n[0088] Taken together, it is demonstrated that CECE imparts various important merits\u2014ine. uding broad material compatibility, high resolution, rapid and mass production, high accessibility, and low cost\u2014for the construction of true 3D architectures. In particular, CECE expands the capability of material choices from limited base materials (e.g., Si and photoresist) to a broad range of engineering materials (e.g.\uff0c polymers, and other printable materials including SiO,, metal, ceramic). Polymers such as UV curable resins, ther- mosets, thermoset metals and thermoplastics. Therefore, CECE promises to pave the road for transferring biomimetic materials into real-world applications. A further break- through with CECE in several directions is expected. For example, the complexity of processible structures can be further extended (e.g., an array of micro helixes) by using more broadly tunable mold materials or realize greater diversity of functions (e.g., self-adaptive, layer-heterogenic,\n\n[0093] Mechanical robustness test. The robustness of the biomimetic materials was tested using a homemade buckling device. A strip (20 mmx5 mmx 0.1 mm) was fixed on the device and was buckled repeatedly at a frequency of 50 times per minute. The curvature of the tested strip was repeatedly changed between 10 cm\u2122! and 1 cm-1. The liquid contact angles and the rectification coefficient were mea- sured after every 1000 buckling cycles for monitoring the\n\n[0086] With the aid of CECE, the present invention enables constructing virtually 3D hierarchical structures\n\nhe potential to achieve a wide range of functionalities. tl\n\ntransport\n\n[0091]\n\nCECE-assisted molding\n\nThe configurabil-\n\nof beam structures with lengths.\n\nApr. 29 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0122091 A1\n\n8\n\nliquid repellency of the superomniphobic material and the\n\n[ 0101 ] Dynamic control of Young's modulus .

Previously, multi-chain network models have been established for better understanding the 3D stress- strain relationship of the elastic solid rubbers. The most basic theoretical approach is to assume Gaussian statistics, which proposes a three-chain network model. E is deduced to be directly proportional to both the chain density n (i.e.\uff0c the number of chains per unit volume) and the temperature T, as shown by equation E=3nkT, where k is the Boltz- mann\u2019s constant.\n\n[0094] Fabrication of 3D Master Structures\n\n[0095] The replication of several representative hierarchi- cal structures were studied, including a close-loop array with hexagon lattice, a close-loop array with square lattice, an array of split ring, a beaded probe, a helix, an arch, and a bull, as shown in FIG. 3A-3G. These structures resemble to those emerging three-dimensional (3D) microstructures reported recently, and were fabricated by Photo lithography, soft lithography, and two-photon lithography as described below.\n\nmixing ratios are cured in two steps, ie., PDMS is cured. firstly at 25\u00b0 C. for 12 h (Phase I), and further at 150\u00b0 C. for 30 min (Phase I). Stain-stress tests were performed after the curing process. The results are shown in FIG. 5A-5C. In phase I, the PDMS is cured at a lower curing temperature, leading to a relatively looser packing of the PDMS network as opposed to that cured at a higher curing temperature. Since the curing time is much shorter than that needed for complete polymerization, PDMS is not completely cross- linked yet at this stage. Therefore, Young\u2019s modulus of the PDMS in Phase I is very low. In Phase II, PDMS is further baked at 150\u00b0 C. for 30 min. In this stage, PDMS becomes fully polymerized, and the baking at high temperature will tighten the PDMS network, leading to higher Young\u2019s modulus, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that\n\n[0096] Arrays of closed loops. An over-exposure photoli- thography was employed for fabricating a large array of closed loops with diverse orientations. For a negative pho- toresist, i.e., SU-8, structures with vertical sides are formed when the recommended exposure dose is used during pho- tolithography. When the SU-8 is overexposed, the tops of the structure expand in horizontal direction. Thus, when the overexposure reaches certain level, the expansion of the tops is so large that the adjacent structures are connected in the tops, forming closed loops.\n\ning overhanging rings or split-rings, SU-8 structure contain- ing 9-um high ring arrays was firstly provided by photoli- thography. A PDMS stamp was then cast to obtain a complementary structure, which consisted of 8-Hm diameter microwells with 5-,un diameter microposts standing in the centers of them. A plastic bar was then applied to squeeze the PDMS piece from one direction at once. The microposts were bent to the same direction and stick to the side wall of the microwells. After the PDMS piece was baked at 250\u00b0 C. for 1 h, the microstructures on the PDMS were stabilized. This master could then be repeatedly used for molding thermoplastic replicas. The molded structure thereby con- tains split-rings. By adjusting the exposure dosage for the SU-8, split rings with different intervals or horizontally hanging closed loops can be fabricated. Enlarging the expo- sure dose increases the top thickness of the ring on the SU-8 master, thereby creating bigger room at the bottom of the\n\n[0103] RTV615 is designed for using with an optimum ratio of pre-polymer to cure agent Ry ,,e/cure equals to 10. Changing the mixing ratios of the PDMS will alter the polymerization kinetics. Decreasing R,,,,\u00a2/cure (\u20ac-2-- from 10 to 5) promotes the crosslinking rate of PDMS, resulting in enhanced stiffness of the PDMS in Phase I, while the final stiffness in Phase II does not change much since the final polymer networks produced using these ratios are similar. However, a much higher concentration (Rj gse/cure<5) Of the curing agent causes a decrease of Young\u2019s modulus both in Phase I and II, because the excess curing agent dilutes the network. On the other hand, when the Ryjse/eure is above 10, the curing rate is reduced, and the average chain length becomes low, resulting in decreased Young\u2019s modulus of the PDMS in both Phases I and II.\n\n[0098] Probe, helix, arch, and bull. These structures were fabricated by two-photon absorption (TPA) using a 3D laser lithography system (Nanoscribe GmbH). The photoresist IP-Dip was drop-cast onto a fused silica substrate, and a 60x objective lens was immersed directly in the photoresist. The 3D microstructures were point-by-point cured by direct laser writing according to the design. After laser writing, the structures were developed in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 20 min, rinsed in isopropyl alcohol, and dried with nitrogen gas.\n\n[0104] Degradation at high temperatures. can be used for thermomolding of plastics such as PFA and PET at temperatures higher than the producer-recommended maximum working temperature of PDMS (204\u00b0 C.) for a few times. The lifespan of PDMS is limited owing to the degradation at such high temperatures. The degradation is resulted from the Si\u2014O bond fracture in the presence of terminal groups, e.g.: =Si\u2014OH. The intermediate product of the degradation can be regarded as a complex with a pentavalent Si-atom, and a hydrogen bond between the hydrogen from the =Si\u2014OH and the oxygen from the siloxane. The Si\u2014C bond fracture results in methane pro- duction. The decomposition leads to a decrease in the molecular weight of PDMS, hence resulting in an increased.\n\n[0099] Mechanical Dynamics of PDMS Associated Curing Dynamics\n\n[0100] Crosslinking. In this work, PDMS room tempera- ture vulcanized silicone (RTV615) supplied by Momentive was used. RTV615 contains two components: (a) RTV A that contains a dimethylvinyl terminated pre-polymer and a Pt-catalyst, and (b) RTV B that contains a cross-linker with several hydride groups. In the presence of the Pt catalyst, the hydrosilane bond of the cross-linker (=SiH) can add into the carbon-carbon double bond of the pre-polymer through hydrosilylation. In this way, the per-polymer chains cross- link into a polymer network.\n\n[0105] Failure in True 3D Molding without Introducing Principle.\n\n[0106] To validate the necessity of using two-step curing PDMS in CECE, two controlled experiments were per- formed.

In the other experiment, a replica was directly molded by using the soft mold in Phase I. As showed in FIG. 6A-6B, both the experiments fail in the creation of configurable elastic cracks and thus no closed-loop replica was obtained.\n\nregion showed in FIG. 2B, the cracking processes were totally out of control, resulting in the damage to the PDMS mold (FIG. 8A). For the geometry (iii), which is inside the predicted successful CECE region, a crack spontaneously formed in each closed loop of PDMS and the PDMS mold can be further used for replication. Then the FEA simulation was performed to reveal the principal stress distribution driving the cracking formation (FIG. 8B). For the PDMS in Phase I, the tensile stress is measured as ~1 MPa, and the ultimate elongation is ~250%. For the closed loops with Worn=4 hm and W,,,,,=8 pum, q equals to 40% and 80%, respectively, both of which are smaller than 100%. In these cases, the von Mises stress mainly concentrates on the neck instead of the bottom area, and thus, the neck area of the PDMS mold will break first and the residual part will be trapped in the master. For the original templates with Winn 12 um and W,,,,,.=16 um, q equals to 120% and 160%, respectively, both of which greater than 100%, and thus, the bottom region breaks first. Meanwhile, for these cases 1/@p equals to 166.7% and 125%, respectively, both of which are smaller than the ultimate elongation of 250%. Therefore, the PDMS can be fully released from the original templates.

The closed- loop arrays (FIG. 1C) were simplified as a 2D contact model (FIG. 7A-7C). For the casting step, the numerical model consisted of aPDMS mold and a SU-8 triangular pillar in the center, which were treated as a \u201ccontact pair\u201d. Material properties in the simulation are listed in Table 2. PDMS was defined as a hyperelastic material using the Neo-Hookean material model, and SU-8 was modeled as linear elastic material. The displacement was prescribed at the boundary of PDMS, which caused both PDMS and SU-8 to deform. The region where the von Mises stress exceeds the tensile stress of the PDMS indicates the site of potential failure.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nMaterial properties in the simulation Materials Parameters PDMS in Phase I Density: 970 kg/m?

The three-dimensional geometry for the test is shown in FIG. 9A. A set of closed loops (length 1-15, 25, 35, 50, 70, 100 um) on the same master made of polymeric materials were pulled out from the elastic cracks. These polymers possess different flexural modulus 6. The replica loop structures experience a drag during releasing from the mold through the cracks; as a result, replica structures with low a and large I were observed to be misshaped. The maximum length 1 of the faithfully released replicas was measured and recorded as the yield point of the material with specific o. The yield points for the closed loops were checked (FIG. 9B) and then were converted to the force F,, as showed in FIG. 2D in main text.\n\n[0110] Study of the Controlled Formation of Elastic Crack\n\ntext, geomet- ric effect on the controllability of the crack formation, a geometric model is provided. Briefly, a cracking coeflicient q W,na/W,, is defined to predict the location for the cracking ormation, where Wap is the smallest cross-section area of the neck region and h is the smallest cross-section area of the locked part. Similarly, to quantify the required maximum deformation of PDMS elastomer for complete release from the master, it is denoted a deformation coefficient Q=Wnin/ W,nax: Where W,,,,,, is the largest cross-sectional area near the locked region. To provide guidance on the design of proper master structures, a phase diagram showing the effect of geometric parameters on the crack formation behavior is mapped out (FIG. 2B). The CECE will fail under the ollowing two conditions. (1) when <100%, the neck region breaks before the occurrence of the desired cracking along the peeling force direction; (2) when 1/@<e (where e is the ultimate elongation of elastomer at break, e=250% for PDMS), the deformation of PDMS goes beyond its limit of the allowed elongation and as a result the mold cannot be\n\n[0115] The reopening of the elastic cracks is further simu- lated. A crack in the PDMS (Phase II) is pre-set in the bottom region of the closed loop. By increasing the neck length, PDMS is easier to be fully released from the daughter structure, as shown in FIG. 10.\n\n[0116] Replication Performance of CECE\n\n[0117] The repeatability of the present method was evalu- ated by fabricating multiple replicas using the same soft mold and checking the replicas with SEM. The replicas were identical with the original template (FIG. 11A-11D). There- fore, the lifetime of the soft mold was conservatively esti- mated to be 250 times.\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICATION\n\n[0118] The present invention relates to a fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures. More par- ticularly, it relates to a method of fabricating three-dimen- sional (3D) hierarchical structures by harnessing the con- figurable elastic crack engineering.\n\n[0112] The cracking behaviors were first investigated with three geometric conditions (i) 7=30%, ~=15%, (ii) n=40%, \u00a2=100%, and (iii) 7=60%, ~=120%.
