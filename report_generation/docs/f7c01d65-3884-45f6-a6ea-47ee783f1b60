In particular, the present invention relates a device for and a method of gradually correcting spinal deformities.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0002] Various correction systems have been used to correct spinal deformities. For example, the Harrington system, introduced in the early 1950s, employs a distrac- tion rod on the concave side of the deformed spine. The use of the Harrington system and spinal fusion in treating idiopathic scoliosis was found useful for both single and double thoracic contours. However, a loss of lumbar lor- dosis, or the \"flatback\" effect, can occur when using the Harrington system along with distraction over the lumbar spine. This effect could be countered by segmental wiring (e.g., sublaminar wiring or wiring of the spinous process) over the instrumented site to retain the lumbar lordosis. Nevertheless, the Harrington system can have limited control of sagittal plane correction, limited derotation, and high rate of hook dislodgment in the lumbar spine, en- counter distraction rod fracture, and require postopera- tive external support. [0003] Armstrong and Connock, and Cotrel and Asso- ciates introduced the use of a compression rod on the convex side, which uses transverse traction with Har- rington rods to correct deformities. Luque and Jacobs introduced the use of strengthened upper hooks to pre- vent pull out and increase yield strength of the distraction rod. These configurations helped the Jacobs\u2019s system achieve correction in hyperextension. [0004] The Luque system employs a spinal implant for scoliosis correction. The use of the spinal implant in- volves both convex technique and concave technique. The convex technique is usually used to treat patients with thoracic curve, whereas the concave technique is used on patients with lumbar curve or severe deformity. The Luque system uses sublaminar wiring as multiple segmental fixation points with attachment to a rod and the L-shaped Luque rod. The sublaminar wiring provides fixation at various points along the instrumented area and allows the correction forces to distribute along the spine, thereby lowering the possibility of bone fracture and the need for post-operative immobilization. [0005] The C-D spinal instrumentation system, intro- duced by Cotrel and Dubousset, employs a dual rod sys- tem interlinked by a transverse traction device (DTT), and multiple hooks on each rod. The C-D system was intended to improve thoracic lordosis, preserve lumbar lordosis in the sagittal plane, improve correction in the frontal plane, and minimize loss of correction in case of hook migration or fracture at the bone-metal interface. [0006] Similar spinal correction systems include the\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nTexas Scottish Rite Hospital (TSRH) Universal Spinal Instrumentation and Isola spinal implant system. The TSRH system, in addition to obtaining a better correction of thoracic curves in the sagittal and coronal planes and maintaining lumbar lordosis, also provides rigidity of the implant against axial and torsional forces with its Crosslink\u2122 device. The TSRH system has been used to treat severe scoliotic curves. The Isola spinal implant sys- tem was developed from Harrington\u2019s principles and de- signs and assembled with variable screw placement sys- tem (VSP). The assembly of this implant is intended to minimize internal or external profiling and increase sta- bility and durability. However, complications associated with iliac screw breakage, transverse connector break- age and screw breakage at the end of constructs have occurred when using the Isola system. [0007] The various conventional correction systems however fail to provide complete correction of scoliotic spines. For example, conventional spinal correction sys- tems, from the earlier Harrington, Jacobs and Luque sys- tems to the later developed systems such as TSRH (SO- FAMOR DANEK, US), CD Horizons (SOFAMOR DANEK, US) and ISOLA (DePuyAcroMed, Raynbam, Massachusetts, US) and Moss Miami (DePuy AcroMed), use slightly different techniques to correct scoliosis. Such correction systems can reduce spinal deformity by only 60% to 70%, but a full correction is almost impossible. The use of excessive correction forces in attempting a full correction can cause bony fractures or neurological deficit due to spinal cord damage. [0008] Moreover, none of the conventional correction systems takes into account the viscoelastic behavior of the spine. Viscoelastic properties of the spine relate to its time dependent mechanical effect, i.e., the stiffness of spine decreases over the duration for which the force is applied. Such mechanical effect has been observed in spinal surgery, where the force required to hold tissue in tension decreases gradually during the operation. The correction force applied by the correction system will also decrease as the tissues relax. The loosening of the cor- rection systems can cause a partial recurrence of de- formity subsequent to the correction. Consequently, con- ventional correction systems can cause a loss of correc- tion for up to 15% due to the recurrence of deformity. Thus, viscoelastic behavior of spinal tissues can limit the amount of correction force and in turn the correction rate. If excessive correction forces are used, they can cause bony fractures. In addition, neurological deficit can occur due to rapid over-stretching of the spinal cord. [0009] Gradual and constant correction forces have been adopted to overcome the deficiency caused by vis- coelastic relaxation of spinal tissues. Such correction forces can take up the loss of correction occurred due to the viscoelastic behaviors of biological tissues and effect a gradual correction of the deformity subsequent to sur- gery. Conventional systems providing gradual or con- stant correction forces nevertheless require some form of repeated surgery or post-operative care, resulting in\n\n55\n\n2\n\n3\n\nEP 1 539 005 B1\n\n4\n\nlonger hospitalization as well as patient inconvenience and discomfort. [0010] Other methods in which a gradual but constant force is applied to the scoliotic spine include external halo traction, intermittent open lengthening and shape change from shape memory alloys. For example, the shape memory effect (SME) of nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy has been used to correct scoliosis in a goat model. However, the mechanical strength of SME was insufficient to fully correct spinal deformities. Pseudoelasticity, another property of nickel-titanium shape memory alloy, can be useful to overcome the above problem and provide a constant recovery force for deformations within the range of 8%. However, such constant correction forces must be kept low to avoid fracture at the anchoring points or interface of the bone and the implant and avoid neuro- logical deficit. [0011] Furthermore, because scoliosis correction is carried out instantaneously and only at the time of surgery with no time for the tissues to relax, the load on the spine rises rapidly. The increased load on the corrected spine limits the amount of correction force that is safely possi- ble. [0012] On the other hand, US-A-4 078 559 discloses a device for correcting spinal deformities, comprising a support member adapted to be mounted onto a portion of a spine and an anchor member adapted to join a portion of the support member to a deformed spine portion, wherein the support member is capable of providing a constant correction force to the deformed spine portion, which force is maintained until the deformities are cor- rected. [0013] Known devices having similar features - which are mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 which follows - are also disclosed by EP-A-0 470 660 and US-A-5 672 175. [0014] The present invention provides a device that overcomes the above problems. Additionally or alterna- tively, the present invention is capable of continuously providing a constant force to the spine even after surgery without post-operative manipulation until the spine is fully corrected.\n\nSUMMERY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0015] The present invention relates generally to spinal deformity correction. More specifically, the present in- vention is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force or a similar correction force and maintaining such correction force constant or substan- tially constant until spinal deformities are corrected. The present invention can correct various spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis, and the rotation around the longitudinal axis of the spine. Additionally or alternatively, the present invention can provide horizontal plane correction of spinal deformities. [0016] The present invention provides a device for cor- recting spinal deformities, as indicated in claim 1 which\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nfollows. The correction device is capable of providing a constant and controllable correction force, which can be applied to the deformed spine portion. Such a correction force can be maintained at a constant level until the spinal deformities are corrected. For example, the correction device can be formed by using the pseudoelastic or su- perelastic properties of a material, such as a NiTi alloy, to provide a constant and controllable correction force. The correction device is capable of completely correcting the spine at the time of operation or gradually correcting the spine both during and after the operation. Additionally or alternatively, the correction device can apply a con- stant correction force subsequent to the surgery, allowing a gradual correction of the spinal deformities.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0017] The detailed description of the present inven- tion will be better understood in conjunction with the ac- companying drawings, wherein like reference charac- ters.represent like elements, as follows: [0018] Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of the invention.

In the fol- lowing discussion, same or similar elements are desig-\n\n3\n\n5\n\nEP 1 539 005 B1\n\n6\n\nnated with the same numeral references and redundant description will be omitted. [0020] The present invention relates generally to the correction of spinal deformities. According to the present invention, a constant or substantially constant force can be provided for spinal deformity correction. Such a cor- rection force is capable of gradually counteracting the viscoelastic phenomenon of the spine. Accordingly, the present invention is capable of fully or substantially fully correcting spinal deformities. Such correction can be car- ried out with or without further manipulation of the cor- rection force after the correction force is applied to the deformed spine portion. A superelastic or pseudoelastic material is used to provide a constant or substantially constant correction force or a similar force, which can be applied to a deformed spine portion. The constant cor- rection force so provided is capable of gradually and con- tinuously correcting spinal deformities. In an exemplary embodiment, a NiTi alloy can be used to provide a con- stant or substantially constant and controllable correction force. It will be appreciated that other embodiment of su- perelastic or pseudoelastic materials are also within the scope of the present invention. [0021] Various methods can be used to form supere- lastic or pseudoelastic materials that are capable of pro- viding a constant correction force. For example, a su- perelastic or pseudoelastic material can be formed by mechanically deform or otherwise physically deform a material beyond its elastic limit but within its plastic limit. The material can be allowed to return to the body tem- perature through heating or gradual warming using any conventional heating mean. Transformation will occur when the material returns to its initial shape to thereby form a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, which can be used for correcting spinal deformities. The transfor- mation can take place instantaneously or over a period of time from several minutes to days. The correction force generated by such a superelastic or pseudoelastic ma- terial can maintain a constant or substantially constant level when such a superelastic or pseudoelastic material is subject to deformation within the range of the elastic limit and the plastic limit of the material. The spinal de- formity correction can be carried out in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, spinal deformities can be completely corrected at the time of operation. In another exemplary embodiment, spinal deformities can be grad- ually corrected both during and after the operation. For example, a constant or substantially constant correction force can be applied to a deformed spine portion subse- quent to the surgery, allowing a gradual correction of the spinal deformities without inducing neurological prob- lems or compromise of the implant-bone interface. [0022] Additionally or alternatively, the spinal deformity correction can be carried out with or without the need for further manipulation. In an exemplary embodiment, a constant or substantially constant and controllable force can be applied to the deformed spine portion with post- operation manipulation. In another exemplary embodi-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n50\n\nment, a constant or substantially constant and controlla- ble force can be applied to the deformed spine portion post-operatively without the need for further manipula- tion. It will be appreciated that other embodiments for correcting spinal deformities are also within the scope of the present invention. [0023] Various spinal deformities can be using the de- vice of the present invention. For example, correction can be directed to the rotation around the longitudinal axis of the spine (apical vertebral rotation or rib hump), which is a typical accompaniment of scoliosis. In an ex- emplary method, correction can be gradually and fully conducted to correct scoliosis. In another exemplary method, a horizontal plane correction can be achieved. [0024] According to one aspect of the present inven- tion, a correction device is provided for correcting spinal deformities. The correction device can be formed in var- ious manners. In an embodiment, the correction device can comprise one or more elastic members that is capa- ble of providing a constant or substantially constant cor- rection force. For example, a superelastic or pseudoe- lastic material can be used to provide a constant or sub- stantially constant correction force. In an exemplary em- bodiment, the correction device can comprise one or more correction member formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic or a similar material to afford such a cor- rection force. The superelastic or pseudoelastic material can acquire the required superelasticity or pseudoelas- ticity, such as by thermal or thermal mechanical treat- ment. For example, the superelastic or pseudoelastic material can have a transition temperature within the range of body temperature. In an exemplary embodi- ment, a NiTi alloy can be used. Various manners of con- structing the correction device will be described in great detail below. The correction device can comprise one or more support members in various forms. For example, the support member can comprise one or more support- ing rods of various shapes depending on the sagittal pro- file of the spine. In one exemplary embodiment, the sup- porting rod can be contoured to assume the normal de- grees of spine kyphosis and lordosis. In another exem- plary embodiment, the supporting rod can have such a length to span across the deformed spine portion. In a further exemplary embodiment, the supporting rod can have various cross-sections. For example, the support- ing rod can have circular, oval, square, hexagonal, or other shapes or a combination thereof. It will be appre- ciated that other forms of the supporting rod and the sup- port member are also within the scope of the present invention. [0025] The support member can be placed at various positions in relation to the spine. In an exemplary em- bodiment, the support member can be provided to extend along at least a portion of the spine. For example, the support member can have such a length to span across the deformed spine portion and bridge the intact verte- brae. Additionally or alternatively, the support member can be placed in the posterior or anterior aspect of the\n\n55\n\n4\n\n7\n\nEP 1 539 005 B1\n\n8\n\nspine in its parent phase (or austenite phase). In an ex- emplary embodiment, the support member can be pro- vided to extend along the posterior side of the spine. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member can be provided to extend along the anterior side of the spine. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of positioning the support member are also within the scope of the present invention. [0026] The support member can be mounted onto the spine in various manners. For example, the support member can be secured onto the spine by various se- curing elements, such as one or more bone fasteners. Examples of bone fasteners include, but not limited to, hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exem- plary embodiment, the supporting rod can have its free ends mounted onto the spine using various bone fasten- ers. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of mounting the support member are also within the scope of the present invention. [0027] The support member can be made of various materials. In one exemplary embodiment, the support member can comprise a superelastic or pseudoelastic material capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force. After such support member is subjected to deformation force, the deformed support member is capable of providing a constant or substan- tially constant force, which enables the deformed support member to return to its initial formation upon the release of the deformation force. The constant or substantially constant force so generated can be used to fully or sub- stantially fully correct various spinal deformities. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member can com- prise a NiTi alloy. It will be appreciated that other supere- lastic or pseudoelastic materials are also within the scope of the present invention. [0028] If desired, the magnitude of the correction force can be adjusted or varied in various manners. For exam- ple, the correction force can be varied by altering the size and shape of the support member. In one exemplary em- bodiment, the correction force can be adjusted by using support members of different diameters. In another ex- emplary embodiment, the correction force can be adjust- ed by using support members of different cross-sections. Additionally or alternatively, a separate device can be used to adjust the correction force. For example, a brak- ing element can be applied to the support member to dampen the correction force. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of adjusting the magnitude of the cor- rection force are also within the scope of the present in- vention. [0029] In another embodiment, the correction device can comprise one or more anchor members in various forms. The anchor member is capable of joining a portion of the support member with the spine. For example, upon the completion of spinal correction surgery, the anchor member can mount the support member onto the de- formed spine portion to lock the support member in place. Exemplary anchor members can include, but not limited\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nto, hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an ex- emplary embodiment, the anchor member can be par- tially formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, such as NiTi, or other materials with similar properties. [0030] In one exemplary embodiment, at least one an- chor member can be in the form of a transverse traction member. The transverse traction member can be con- nected between the support member and a vertebra of the spine directly or via another anchor member. The transverse traction member can be formed to provide an independent correction force of a constant or substan- tially constant value. For example, the transverse traction element can comprise a superelastic or pseudoelastic material or other similar materials. In one exemplary em- bodiment, the independent correction force generated by the transverse traction member is capable of correct- ing the spinal deformities without using a superelastic support member. In another exemplary embodiment, the independent correction force generated by the trans- verse traction member can be used to reinforce, reduce, terminate, or otherwise adjust the correction force gen- erated by the support member. Exemplary transverse traction members can include, but are not limited to, su- perelastic spring members, adjustable cylinders, internal motors, gear boxes, and the like. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the transverse traction mem- ber and the anchor member are also within the scope of the present invention. [0031] The anchor members can be locked onto the support member and the deformed spine portion in var- ious manners. For example, the locking process can be carried out by tightening the anchor members. In an ex- emplary embodiment, the locking process can be carried out by using a surgical tool, such as a screw driver, via incision. In another exemplary embodiment, the locking process can be induced remotely without the need for open surgery. For example, the locking process can be carried out by triggering shape change in a NiTi anchor member, such as through heating. In an exemplary em- bodiment, a heating device, such as an electromagnetic device, can be used to provide the heat. In one exemplary embodiment, the heating device can be applied to the skin in a close proximity to the NiTi anchor member. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the locking process are also within the scope of the present inven- tion. [0032] According to the present invention, at least one of the support member and the anchor member can be formed as a correction member. The correction member is capable of providing a constant or substantially con- stant correction force for correcting spinal deformities. The correction device so formed is thus capable of grad- ually and fully correcting spinal deformities without further manipulation of the correction member after the spinal correction surgery. [0033] If desired, the support member can be restricted from undesired movement or rotation. The restriction can be carried out in various manners. For example, one or\n\n55\n\n5\n\n9\n\nEP 1 539 005 B1\n\n10\n\nmore restraining elements can be provided to prevent the support member from undesired movement or rota- tion. In one exemplary embodiment, the restraining ele- ment can comprise one or more locking elements, such as lockable clamps, which are capable of preventing the support member from further movement. Additionally or alternatively, the restraining element can comprise a stopper element to prevent the support member from ro- tating beyond a pre-defined position. The restraining el- ement can be operated in various manners. In an exem- plary embodiment, the restraining element can be oper- ated by a direct access tool, such as a screw driver. In another exemplary embodiment, the restraining element can be operated by a remote access tool, such as an electromagnetic heating device. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the restraining element are also within the scope of the present invention. [0034] If desired, the correction device can be provided with additional components to reinforce, reduce, termi- nate, or otherwise adjust the correction force. For exam- ple, the correction device can further comprise one or more of the following components: (a) means for alter- nating the diameter of the support member to control re- covery force; (b) one or more internal motor, gear boxes, and the like; and (c) springs or coils or wires made from a superelastic material or other materials with similar properties. [0035] Various embodiments of the correction device will be described in great detail below. [0036] Figs. 1a and 1b show a first embodiment of the correction device 1 for correcting various spinal deform- ities, such as scoliosis. The correction device 1 can be in various forms and be mounted onto at least a portion of the spine 2. For example, the correction device 1 can be either applied to the vertebral body anteriorly or ap- plied to elements of the neural arch posteriorly. In one embodiment, the correction device 1 can comprise a sup- port member 10 of various forms. In an exemplary em- bodiment, the support member 10 can comprise a sup- porting rod 12 of various shapes. For example, the sup- porting rod 12 can have a general curved shape, such as a \"C\" or \"S\" shape, or other shapes depending on the sagittal profile of the spine. In another exemplary embod- iment, the support member 10 can be contoured to con- form to the natural spine curvature(s). For example, the support member 10 can be contoured to assume the nor- mal degree of spine kyphosis and/or lordosis. In an ex- emplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 1b, the sup- port member 10 can comprise a curved portion 14, which can be formed such as by bending the support member 10 to conform to a deformed spine portion 4 to be cor- rected. [0037] The support member 10 can be placed in vari- ous positions in relation to the spine 2. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be positioned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. In another exem- plary embodiment, the curved support member 10 can be positioned on the posterior side of the vertebrae and\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nlongitudinally aligned with the vertebrae so that the hump of the curved support member 10 can be positioned at the posterior side of the body. [0038] The support member 10 can be secured to the spine 2 as a support for the correction device 1. For ex- ample, the support member 10 can be fixed onto one or more vertebrae by one or more securing elements 20. Exemplary securing elements 20 can . include, but are not limited to, hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be an elongated member, which is capable of span- ning the deformed spine portion 4 or otherwise bridging between a proximal end 6 and a distal end 8 of the spine 2. The end portions 16 and 18 of the support member 10 can be fixed to an upper vertebra 6 and a lower vertebra 8 to thereby mount the correction device 1 onto the spine 2. In another exemplary embodiment, the support mem- ber 10 can be fixed to the vertebrae at multiple locations. [0039] The support member 10 can be formed of var- ious materials. For example, the support member 10 can be formed of a material that is capable of providing suf- ficient strength for the correction device 1. In one exem- plary embodiment, the support member 10 can comprise an elastic material capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force. For example, the support member 10 can be formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, or other materials with similar properties. [0040] In another embodiment, the correction device 1 can comprise one or more anchor members 30 to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4 to apply a correction force thereto. The anchor mem- bers 30 can be in various forms. For example, various bone anchors can be used to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4. Exemplary anchor members 30 can include, but are not limited to, wires, threads, hooks, screws, clamps and the like. In an ex- emplary embodiment, one or more anchor members 30 used can be the same as the securing elements 20 dis- cussed above. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more anchor members 30 can be in the form of a trans- verse traction member 32 (see Fig. 2). Such transverse traction member 32 is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant force for correcting various spinal deformities as will be discussed in detail below. [0041] The anchor members 30 can be used in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, the anchor members 30 can join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4 at the time of operation. In an- other exemplary embodiment, one or more anchor mem- bers 30 can be linked to at least one of the support mem- ber 10 and the deformed spine portion 4 but left unlocked at the time of operation. The unlocked anchor members 30 can later join the support member 10 to the deformed spine portion 4 by various means after the operation. [0042] The correction device 1 is capable of fully or substantially fully correcting spinal deformities. In an ex- emplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be\n\n55\n\n6\n\n11\n\nEP 1 539 005 B1\n\n12\n\nformed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, or other materials with similar properties. One portion 14 of the superelastic support member 10 can be subjected to a deformation force and bent to conform to the deformed spine portion 4. The anchor member 30 can be applied to join the bent portion 14 of the support member 10 and the deformed spine portion 4, such as shown in Fig. 1b. The correction of spine deformities can be achieved by straightening the bent portion 14 in a coronal or sagittal plane. In one exemplary embodiment, the support mem- ber 10 is capable of returning to its initial shape and pro- viding a constant or substantially constant correction force in the return process. Additionally or alternatively, a transverse traction member 32 can be provided, which is capable of providing a constant or substantially con- stant transverse traction force for correcting spine de- formities as will be discussed below. [0043] Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the cor- rection device 1, which is of a single support member type. Similar to the above, the support member 10 can be in a \"C\" or \"S\" shape, depending on the sagittal profile of the spine. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be longitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be disposed on the deformed spine 2 extending between a proximal vertebra 6 and a distal vertebra 8. The support member 10 can be mount- ed onto the spine 2 to provide a support for the correction device 1. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 2, the two ends 16 and 18 of the support member 10 can be fixed to the proximal vertebra 6 and the distal vertebra 8. In another exemplary embodiment, the sup- port member 10 can be secured to multiple sections of the deformed spine 2. [0044] One or more anchor members 30 can be used to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4. Similar to the above, the anchor members 30 can be activated to lock the support member 10 and the deformed portion 4 during or after the spine surgery, or both. Additionally or alternatively, the activation can be carried out either by a mechanical device, such as a screw driver or by a remote means, such as an electro- magnetic heating. In an embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 2, one [0045] or more anchor members 30 can be in the form of trans- verse traction members 32. In an exemplary embodi- ment, one or more transverse traction members 32 can be connected between the support member 10 and one or more vertebrae of the spine 2 via another anchor mem- ber 30. The traction members 32 can be in various forms and capable of providing a constant or substantially con- stant transverse traction force. In an exemplary embod- iment, the traction member 32 is capable of reinforcing or reducing the correction force provided by the support member 10. In another exemplary embodiment, the transverse traction member 32 is capable of independ- ently correcting spinal deformities. Exemplary transverse traction members 32 can include, but are not limited to,\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n50\n\nsuperelastic spring members, adjustable cylinders, inter- nal motors, gear boxes, and the like. [0046] Fig. 3 shows a third embodiment of the correc- tion device 1, which is of a dual support member type. The correction device 1 can comprise first and second support members 10a and 10b, such as in the form of \"C\" or \"S\" shaped supporting rods 12a and 12b. The sup- port members 10a and 10b can be disposed in various positions in relation to the deformed spine 2. In one ex- emplary embodiment, at least one of the support mem- bers 10a and 10b can be longitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the spine 2. In another exemplary em- bodiment, the first and second support members 10a and 10b can fit into the concave and convex sides of the de- formed spine portion 4, respectively. If desired, one or more cross-linking elements 40 can be provided to con- nect between the support members 10a and 10b, such as shown in Fig. 3. [0047] The support members 10a and 10b can be se- cured to the deformed spine 2 in various manners. In one exemplary embodiment, the support members 10a and 10b can extend from a proximal vertebra 6 to a distal vertebra 8 of the spine 2 and be secured thereonto. For example, the ends 16a and 18a, or 16b and 18b, of the support member 10a or 10b can be fixed to the proximal and distal vertebrae 6 and 8 by various securing elements 20, such as hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In one exemplary embodiment (not shown), the upper ends 16a and 16b of the support members 10a and 10b can be secured onto different proximal vertebrae. In an- other exemplary embodiment, each support member 10a or 10b can be secured to multiple sections of the de- formed spine 2. [0048] In one exemplary embodiment, at least one of the support members 10a and 10b can be formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic, or materials with similar properties. In an exemplary embodiment, both support members 10a and 10b can be made of a superelastic material. The superelastic support members 10a and 10b can be bent to form a bent portion 14a and 14b to fit into the deformed spine portion 4, such as shown in Fig. 3. The correction of spine deformities can be achieved by straightening the bent portions 14a and 14b in a coronal or sagittal plane. In an exemplary embodiment, the hump of the bent portions 14a and 14b can be positioned at the posterior side of the body. The bent portions 14a and 14b can be joined to the deformed spine potion 4 in var- ious manners to apply the correction force thereto. In an embodiment, a plurality of anchor members 30 can be used to implant into one or more sections of the deformed spine portion 4 to join the same with the support members 10a and 10b. The anchor members 30 can be locked either at the time of operation or after the operation. [0049] Fig. 4 shows a fourth embodiment of the cor- rection device 1, which is of a dual support member type. The correction device 1 can comprise first and second support members 10a and 10b, such as \"C\" or \"S\" shaped supporting rods 12a and 12b. The support members 10a\n\n55\n\n7\n\n13\n\nEP 1 539 005 B1\n\n14\n\nand 10b can be similarly disposed in various positions in relation to the deformed spine 2. In one exemplary em- bodiment, one or both of the first and second support members 10a and 10b can be longitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. The support members 10a and 10b can be secured onto the spine 2 through various securing elements, such as hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the upper ends 16a and 16b of the support members 10a and 10b can be fixed to each other and an upper vertebra 6 through wires, hooks, screws, clamps, and the like. In another exemplary embodiment, the first and second support members 10a and 10b can be secured to differ- ent upper and/or lower vertebrae 6 and 8. [0050] In one exemplary embodiment, the second sup- port member 10b can be formed of a superelastic material or other materials of comparable properties. The supere- lastic support member 10b can be deposited on the de- formed spine portion 4, such as shown in Fig. 4. In an exemplary embodiment, the second support member 10b can be bent to form a curved portion 14b conforming to the deformed spine portion 4 and join the same through various anchor members 30. For example, the anchor members 30 can be implanted to one or more vertebra to fix the second support member 10b to the deformed spine portion 4. The anchor members 30 can be operated in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, the anchor members 30 can be left unlocked at the time of the spine surgery and activated to switch to a locked po- sition after the surgery. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more [0051] transverse traction members 32 can be provided to gen- erate an independent constant or substantially constant correction force. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 4, the transverse traction members 32 can be provided to join between the first and second support members 10a and 10b. In one exemplary embodiment, the transverse traction members 32 are capable of ad- justing the magnitude of the correction force generated by the second support member 10b. For example, each transverse traction member 32 can provide an independ- ent correction force to reinforce or reduce the value of the constant correction force so that the correction device 1 is capable of providing a constant correction force of a different value than that generated by the second support member 10b. Exemplary transverse traction members 32 can include, but are not limited to, superelastic spring members, adjustable cylinders, internal motors, gear boxes, and the like. [0052] In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 5a or Fig. 5b, one or more braking elements 50 can be provided and formed in various manners to adjust the constant correction force. For example, the braking elements 50 can be attached to any portion of the support member 10 or the anchor members 30 to reduce or ter- minate the correction force applied to correct scoliosis. Exemplary braking elements 50 can include, but are not limited to, wires, threads, hooks, screws, clamps and the\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nlike. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more braking elements 50 can be in the form a clamp 52, such as a \"C\" shaped clamp. In another exemplary embodiment, the clamp 52 can be at least partially formed of a supere- lastic or pseudoelastic material or other materials with the same properties. In a further exemplary embodiment, the braking elements 50 can be the same as the anchor member 30. [0053] Additionally or alternatively, one or more brak- ing elements 50 can be formed to provide an adjustable braking force. In an exemplary embodiment, the clamp 52 can be coated with a material, such as polyethylene, on the internal surface thereof to reduce or dissipate the correction force or energy generated by the support member 10. The correction force can be controlled by varying the coating material or the gripping force of the clamp 52. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more braking elements 50 can be in the form of an ad- justable screw or washer element 54. Depending on how tight the adjustable screw or washer element 54 is ad- justed, the braking element 50 is capable of providing a variable braking force to the support member 10, thereby controlling the correction force. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the braking elements 50 are also within the scope of the present invention. [0054] If desired, various accessory elements can be used in the correction device 1. For example, one or more restraining elements 60 can be provided to limit the sup- port member 10 from undesired movement or rotation. The restraining elements 60 can be in various forms. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 6a or 6b, one or more locking elements 62 can be used to limit the movement of the support members 10,10a, and 10b. Exemplary locking elements 62 can include, but are not limited to, clamps, lockable clamps or similar devices. In an exemplary embodiment, the locking elements 62 can be in the form of \"C\" shaped clamps, which is adapted to be placed on the support members 10, 10a, and 10b. The locking elements 62 can be made of various mate- rials, such as an NiTi alloy. [0055] The locking elements 62 can be used in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more locking elements 62 can be set in a closed position at the time of surgery to retain the support members 10, 10a, and 10b in an appropriate position while other lock- ing elements 62 can be set at an open position. When the spine correction comes to finish or satisfactory, the closed locking elements 62 can be opened and the open locking element 62 can be closed. In another exemplary embodiment, the locking elements 62 can be set in an open position at the time of surgery to retain the support members 10, 10a, and 10b in an appropriate position. When the correction comes to a full or substantially full completion, the locking elements 62 can then be tight- ened. [0056] The locking and unlocking processes can be activated by various mechanisms, such as by a shape memory effect found in a NiTi alloy or by the use of a\n\n55\n\n8\n\n15\n\nEP 1 539 005 B1\n\n16\n\nmechanical device, such as screws and nuts. Additionally or alternatively, the locking and unlocking processes can be controlled in various manners, such as manually or remotely. [0057] Additionally or alternatively, the restraining el- ement 60 can be in the form of one or more blocking elements 64 for restraining the movement of the support members 10, 10a, and 10b, such as shown in Figs. 7a and 7b. In an exemplary embodiment, the blocking ele- ments 64 can be placed on the securing elements 20. In another exemplary embodiment, the blocking elements 64 can be placed on the corresponding upper and lower vertebrae 6 and 8 of instrumented spine 2. Exemplary blocking elements 64 can include, but are not limited to, screws, screws with washers, or similar devices. [0058] In one exemplary embodiment, when the su- perelastic support member 10 restores to its original po- sition after being implanted, the blocking elements 64 can act as a stop mechanism to intercept the movement of the support member 10. The blocking elements 64 can instantaneously stop the movement of the support mem- ber 10 without any manual or remote control means. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the re- straining elements 60 are also within the scope of the present invention. [0059] It will be appreciated that the various features described herein may be used singly or in any combina- tion thereof. Therefore, the present invention is not lim- ited to only the embodiments specifically described here- in.
