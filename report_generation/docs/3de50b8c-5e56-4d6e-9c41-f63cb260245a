The operation of this precoder device is equivalent to a trailing-zero digital precoder. In this example, the precoder device comprises a delay element arranged to introduce a delay to a plurality of sub-channels ofa signal at a transmitter end of the communication system; wherein the delay in a plurality of sub-channels are associ- ated with a process time of a receiver component at a receiver end of the communication system.\n\n[0053] Preferably, the delay element includes an analogue delay element, such as but not limited to an analogue delay-line built with printed circuit board traces connected. with each of the sub-channels. As appreciated by a skilled person, electrical conductors such as traces defined on a PCB introduces propagation delay to a signal to be trans- mitted between components, and the delay time is based on the length of the trace as the signal has to propagate a longer distance if the PCB trace is longer.\n\n[0054] Alternatively, other analogue delay components modules may be used to create such delays in each of sub-channel components of the transmitted signal.\n\n[0047] In this embodiment, different delays are introduced to each of the sub-channels at the transmitter end such that each of the sub-channel signals may be properly processed without a need oil temporary storing the received signal upon the signal reaches the receiver end. Such delay period is closely relevant to the process time of the receiver. For example, the process time may include a sampling time period of an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver end, which also defines the symbol rate of the wireless signal receiver.\n\n[0055] In one example embodiment, a low-complexity precoder may be constructed with an analogue delay-line. Preferably, the precoder does not require high speed memory to store the blocking signal, nor an analogue-to-digital convertor (ADC) and memory module to operate at the same rate of the transmit symbol rate.\n\n[0056] Preferably, the sub-channel analogue signals may be sampled at rate P before feeding into the analogue delay-line with constant time delay At per adjacent sub- channel. In addition, the delay element may be provided in the output stage of the transmitter end, i.e. just before the signal is transmitted using the antenna(s) in the transmitter.\n\n[0048] Preferably, the modulated signal in each of the sub-channels will be passed to the antennas through the switches and the delay components in each of the individual channels. By introducing a delay component, between the switches and the antennas, the sub-channel signals reach the antenna and therefore are placed in a transmission queue according to the different delay periods placed in the output stage in each channel.\n\n[0057] With reference to FIG. 4, there is shown an alter- native embodiment of a precoder device 400. In this embodi- ment, the precoder device is a delay-line analogue precoder which operates as an arbitrary digital linear precoder.\n\n[0049] At the receiver end, the ADC processes the received signals including multiple sub-channel compo- nents, one at a time, and according to the order of the components in the aforementioned queue, with a substan- tially constant processing time. Preferably, each of the sub-channel signals at the transmitter end is introduced with an incremental time delay with a predetermined time dif- ference between adjacent, sub-channels, such that the mul- tiple sub-channels may be processed one at a time, and the incremental delays may ensure that the next sub-channel signal does not reach the receiver end when the previous one is still under processing by the ADC. In some embodiments, the time difference between the sub-channels may be con- stant.\n\n[0058] In this example, the precoder device 400 further comprises a universal precoder 402 and a plurality of analog permutation switches 404 both arranged to process each of the plurality of sub-channels in the signal at the transmitter end.\n\n[0059] In an example digital implementation, the universal digital precoder may be separated into two parts, a universal precoder U(z) and a permutation matrix M. In other words, an arbitrary linear precoder in (2) may be factorized into the following matrix product\n\nGZ)=M-C-UG) (9)\n\nwherein U(z) s a linear precoding matrix with dimensions of KxK, where K denotes a total number of sub-channels of the signal; C is a rectangular matrix with dimensions of PxK, where P denotes a sample cate of sub-channel analogue signals; and M is a square permutation matrix with dimen- sions of PxP.\n\n[0050] Alternatively, the incremental delay time At may match with other components in the receiver system at early stage in the receiver.\n\n[0051] With reference to FIG. 3, the delay At is adjusted be the same as the sampling time period of the ADC (the symbol rate) in the receiver.
