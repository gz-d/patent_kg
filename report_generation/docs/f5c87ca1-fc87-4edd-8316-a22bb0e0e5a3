RGY TRANSFER BY INDU\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThis invention relates to an apparatus for the transfer of energy by electrical induction, and\n\nin particular to an induction heating apparatus, for example an induction cooking apparatus.\n\n10\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\na single spiral\n\ninduction cooker usually uses\n\nInduction heating equipment such\n\nas\n\nan\n\nwinding as the primary transformer winding. When excited by a high-frequency ac voltage generated by a power electronic circuit, a high-frequency ac magnetic flux is created in the spiral winding. This magnetic flux points in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the spiral winding. Protected by a layer of electrical insulator, the ac excited spiral winding provides an induction surface, When a secondary element such as a metallic cooking pot is placed on top of the electrically insulated surface of the spiral primary winding, current wil! be induced in the secondary metallic material by induction due to the ac magnetic flux created in the spiral primary winding. The conduction loss due to the induced current in the secondary element causes heating of the\n\nsecondary clement.\n\nPRIOR ART\n\n25\n\nSimilar induction heating equipment using a single spiral winding for drying printing materials has been proposed by Elgee et al in US patent 6,349,671. Ulrich ot al proposed an induction heating system using a flexible coil in US patent 6,346,690 and US patent 6,229,126, The flexible coil is wound in a concentric manner and is fed by a power supply. There are limitations in using a single spiral winding as the inductive element. First, the magnetic field distribution is not\n\n20\n\n25\n\nC\n\nthe\n\nand the\n\nuniform, The magnetic flux (\u00a2) is proportional to the product of current (#) in number of tums (N) of the winding. For a spiral winding, the number of tums is highest in the centre of the spiral winding and lowest in the edge of the spiral winding. This means that the magnitude of the magnetic field is highest in the centre and decreases from the centre, Fig.1(s) showa a typical single spiral winding. If excited with an ac power source at high frequency (say over 10kHz), an ac magnetic flux is generated. Fig.1(b) shows the measured magnitude plot of the magnetic field distribution of the single spiral winding in Fig.1(a). It can be seen that the magnitude of the magnetic field is highest in the centre of the spiral winding and this magnitude decreases with\n\nincreasing distance from the centre.\n\nIf the secondary element is not placed in the central area of the inductive surface, the magnetic flux it experiences is small and therefore the current induced in it is also small. Consequently, the heating effect is far from satisfactory. This non-uniform magnetic field distribution and its associated non-uniform heating problem limit the performance of many commercial induction heating systems.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided apparatus for the transfer of energy by electrical induction comprising a primary induction unit formed with a planar surface for receiving at Jeast one secondary element to which energy is to be transferred, wherein said primary induction unit comprises an array of primary transformer windings so as to provide a substantially uniform magnetic flux distribution over said planar surface.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the primary windings are connected in groups to define a plurality of energy transfer areas whereby energy may be transferred to a plurality of secondary elements provided simultancously on said planar surface.

As shown in Fig.2, the induction system consists of two units, namely (1) a power delivering inductive circuit that contains the primary circuit of an array of planar isolation transformer windings and (2) a secondary element that couples energy from the primary inductive circuit. In the context of an induction cooker, the secondary element may be a metallic pan 1, while the first element is the induction heating surface 2 on which the pan is to be\n\nplaced.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of primary transformer windings are located in the primary inductive circuit, and preferably in the form of an array as shown in Fig.3 The windings may be circular, rectangular, hexagonal, square or any polygonal shape. The\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nC\n\nwindings may be connected in series, or in parallel or in a combination of both. By providing an array of windings a more uniform magnetic flux distribution can be provided, and the possibility of a localized charging zone mechanism is enabled as will be discussed further below. It will be understood that only the area of the induction surface covered by the secondary element will be activated, while most of the non-covered area radiates virtually no energy.\n\n10\n\nAs shown in Fig.4, the primary transformer circuit unit transmits electrical energy at high frequency through a flat inductive surface that contains an array of primary transformer windings. The inductive surface can be of circular, square, rectangular, hexagonal or any polygonal shape depending on the requirement of the applications. In Fig.4, a rectangular inductive surface is used as an example. The primary transformer windings can be of circular, square, rectangular, hexagonal or any polygonal shape. If utilization of space is needed, these windings can be wound into hexagonal shape. These windings can be wound in a concentric or spiral manner. For low power applications, they can be printed on a circuit board,\n\nAn important aspect of the present invention the primary transformer windings are arranged in the form of an array. These windings can be connected in series or in parallel or a combination both. The advantage of using an array of primary transformer windings is to generate a more uniform magnetic field than a single winding. This uniform magnetic field distribution is illustrated in a practical example of a 4x4 winding array as shown in Fig.5(a). When connected in series (of the same polarity) and excited with a high-frequency ac voltage, this 4x4 winding array generates magnetic field that is almost uniform as shown in Fig.5(b). Each winding generates its own magnetic field. When arranged in an array manner, the overall magnetic field is much more uniform than the field generated by a single winding. This can bc clearly seen by comparing the magnitude of and\n\nplots\n\nFig,1(b)\n\nFig.5(b).\n\nBesides using the series connection, the primary transformer windings can be connected in parallel or a combination of series and parallel. Fig.6(a) shows an example with an array of primary\n\n25\n\nof\n\na\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n7\n\nC\n\nthat the\n\nand D. This\n\nwindings forming four groups in four zones A,B,C means proposed more than one primary transformer winding connected in parallel to the power inverter of the primary induction circuit. If the secondary element is placed on Zones A and B, the equivalent circuit of the proposed system is shown in Fig.6(b), As the secondary element is close to the primary windings in Zones A and B (but not C and D), only the primary windings A and B sense the secondary load. Primary windings C and D have virtually no load and therefore their secondary circuits are essentially open circuits. This means that only the overlapped area between the induction surface and the secondary element has energy transfer. This localized activation principle an feature of this invention.\n\nhas\n\ninduction\n\nis\n\nimportant\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention features a primary induction circuit that has (1) a switched mode power electronic circuit, (2) a transformer that consists of a primary winding or a group of primary windings connected in series or in parallel or a combination of both, (3) an optional EMI shield (which may be a combination of a ferrite sheet and a copper sheet) and (4) a flat interface surface on which the secondary element or elements can be placed and can couple energy from the primary induction circuit. The schematic of the primary induction system is shown in Figs4(a) and (b).\n\nThe induction system can be powered by AC or DC power sources. If the power supply is the AC mains, the switched mode power electronic circuit should perform a low-frequency (50 or 60Hz) AC to DC power conversion and then DC to high-frequency (typically in the range from 20kHz to |OMHz) AC power conversion. This high-frequency AC voltage will feed the primary winding or windings of the primary induction circuit. If the power supply is a DC voltage source (e.g. a battery), the switched mode power supply should perform a DC to high-frequency AC power conversion. The high-frequency voltage is fed to the primary winding or windings of the transformer.\n\nr\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nThe induction system is able to induce current in the secondary clement or elements. For\n\ninduction heating systems, the heat distribution should be as uniform as possible. In addition, only the overlapped area of the primary induction surface and the secondary clement provides energy transfer. In order to achieve these functions, the AC magnetic flux experienced by the secondary element should be as even as possible. A standard spiral winding as shown in Fig.1(a) is not suitable to meet this requirement because its flux distribution is not uniform as shown in Fig.1(b) when the winding is excited by an AC power source, The reason for such non-uniform magnetic flux distribution is that the number of turns in the central region of the single spiral winding largest. As the magnetic flux or magnetomorive force (mmf) is proportional to the product of the number of turn and the current in the winding, the magnitude of the magnetic flux or mmf is highest\n\nin the centre of the winding.\n\nthat\n\nAn improved method proposed in this invention is to ensure the magnetic distribution experienced by secondary element is as uniform as possible. This method can be realized by using a \u201cdistributed\u201d primary transformer winding array structure as shown in Fig.3. This planar winding array consists of many spiral windings. These spiral windings can have hexagonal, circular, square or rectangular patterns. These transformer windings can be connected in series, in parallel or a combination of both to the high-frequency AC voltage generated in the power circuit.\n\nsupply in the primary charger shows\n\nFig.5(a) a practical example with the transformer winding array connected in series so that all the fluxes created in the windings point to the same direction. Fig.5(b) shows the measured flux distribution of one planar transformer when the windings in the transformer array are connected in series. This measurement confirms the uniform magnetic flux distribution of the array structure. Comparison of Fig.1(b) and Fig.5(b) confirms the improvement of the uniform magnetic field distribution the transformer structure. In addition, the transformer array structure\n\nusing\n\narray\n\nis\n\nflux\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nenables the possibility of creating a multiple primary transformer windings structure which allows for a new localized energy transfer mechanism as explained below.\n\nThe primary transformer windings can also have\n\na combination of series and parallel\n\nconnections if desired. Such an arrangement allows the induction surface to provide various induction regions to cater for different sizes of the secondary elements. Fig,6(a) illustrates this localized induction zone principle. Assume that the transformer array is divided into 4 zones (A, B, C and D). The transformer windings within each zone are connected in series to form one primary winding group with distributed magnetic flux feature. There will be four primary windings in the equivalent circuit as shown in Fig.6(b). If the secondary element is placed on Zones A and B, the equivalent electrical circuit is shown in Fig.6(b). Only the parallel primary transformer winding groups for Zones A and B are loaded because they can sense a nearby secondary clement that can couple energy from the primary windings. Therefore, they will generate magnetic flux in Zones A and B. Primary transformer windings C and D are not loaded because they have no secondary element close to them. Their equivalent secondary circuits are simply an open-circuit (Fig.6(b)). As a result, power transfer between the primary induction circuit and the secondary element takes place basically through the coupled regions (areas) of the induction interface surface covered by the secondary element. The non-covered area of the induction surface will transfer very limited energy.\n\nThis special design avoids unnecessary or excessive electromagnetic interference.\n\nIn the present invention, at least in preferred forms, there is proposed a new induction system that overcomes the non-uniform magnetic flux problem arising from using a single spiral winding. More importantly, the proposed induction system, based on a winding array structure, can generate a near-uniform magnetic field over the needed areas on the inductive surface and thus provide a near-uniform heating effect in the secondary element. Based on a multiple primary transformer winding concepts, the invention also operates on a new localized energized zone principle so that energy is coupled to the secondary element primarily through the overlapped area\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n10\n\nof the inductive and the secondary element. That is to say, energy is only transferred when a secondary winding or element is placed over one or more of the primary windings, and energy is only transferred from those primary windings that couple to the secondary winding or element, mainly the primary winding or windings directly beneath the secondary winding or element, and possibly also (though to a lesser extent) any ncarby primary windings that are close enough to couple to the secondary winding or element to a significant extent,\n\nIn the embodiments described above a single layer of transformer arrays is provided. However, in order to generate a more uniform magnetic field distribution, multi-layer transformer arrays can be used. The following embodiments describe how multiple layers of transformer arrays may be used that can provide a very uniform magnetic field distribution on the energy transfer surface,\n\nFig.7 shows a 4xS primary planar transformer winding array which consists of square-spiral winding pattems. This can be fabricated on one layer of a printed circuit board structure for low power applications, though for high power applications it should be an actual winding. It should be noted that, for an individual winding pattern in the array, the magnitude of the magnetic flux is highest in the center of the spiral winding. The magnitude of the magnetic flux is smallest in the small gap between adjacent winding patterns.\n\nsecond\n\nwith\n\ntransformer\n\nA layer a 3x4 winding array is shown in Fig.8. The individual winding pattems in both layers are identical. As shown in Fig.9, by having the two layers of arrays arranged in such a manner that the center (region of maximum magnetic flux magnitude) of a winding pattern on one layer is placed on the gap (region of minimum magnetic flux magnitude) between adjacent winding pattems on the other layer, the variation of the magnetic field magnitude can be minimized and the magnetic flux magnitude can therefore be made as even as possible over the overlapped surface. The essence of the multi-layer transformer arrays is to have a displacement between the individual winding patterns of the two layers so that the regions of the maximum\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n11\n\nmagnetic field magnitude of one layer is \u201cevened out\u201d by the regions of the minimum magnetic field magnitude,\n\nIn order to\n\nexamine the \u2018uniform magnetic field magnitude\u2019 feature of the proposed\n\noverlapped multi-layer transformer arrays, this \u2018magnitude smoothing\u2019 concept is illustrated in simplified diagrams in Fig.10 to 12. Pig.10 is a simplified version of Fig.7. Each solid square in Fig.10 represents a square-spiral winding pattern in the first layer (Fig.7). Fig.11 is a simplified version of the Fig.8. Each dotted square represents a square-spiral winding pattern in the second layer (Fig.8). The simplified version of the multi-layer array structure is shown in Fig.12. From Fig.12, it can be seen that the overlapped array structure (with correct displacement between the two layers) divides each square-spiral winding pattern into four smaller sub-regions. The important feature is that the four sub-regions are identical in terms of winding structure. Despite that fact that the distribution of the magnetic field magnitude on the surface of each individual square-spiral winding is not uniform, the distribution of the resultant magnitude field magnitude on the surface of each sub-region is more or less identical because of the overlapped multi-layer winding structure. The concept of the generating uniform magnetic field magnitude over the energy transfer surface is\n\nillustrated in Fig.\n\n13.\n\nIn this example, a multi-layer transformer winding array structure that can provide a uniform magnetic field magnitude distribution is described. This example is based on square-spiral winding patterns. In principle, winding pattems of other shapes can also be applied as long as the resultant magnetic field magnitude distribution is as uniform as possible.\n\nThe use of two layers of transformer arrays can reduce the variation in the magnetic flux over the energy transfer surface. However, there may still be some variations and the use of a three or four layer structure may provide a still more uniform flux distribution as described in the following embodiments.\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n12\n\nThe following cmbodimcnt is a structure comprising three layers of planar winding arrays,\n\nThis winding structure can generate magnetomotive force (mmf) of substantially even magnitude over the energy transfer surface. Each winding array consists of a plurality spiral windings cach of which are of an hexagonal shape. A spiral winding arranged in a hexagonal shape is shown in Fig.14, For simplicity, it will be represented as a hexagon as shown in Fig.15. A plurality of hexagonal spiral windings can be arranged as an array as shown in Fig.16. These windings can be connected in parallel, in series or a combination of both to the electronic driving circuit. If a current passes through each spiral winding pattem, a magnetomotive force (mmy), which is equal to the product of the number of tums (N) and current (J) (i.e. NJ), is generated. Fig.17 shows two spiral winding pattems adjacent to each other and the per-unit mmf plot over the distance (dotted line) can be linearized as shown jn Fig.18. It can be seen that the mmf distribution over the distance is not uniform. The maximum mmf occurs in the center of the hexagonal pattem and the minimum mmf\n\noccurs in the edge of the pattern.\n\nFig.19 shows three adjacent windings. The maximum mmf\n\nis labeled\n\nregion by a symbol \u2018P\u2019 (which stands for Peak mmf). The minimum mmf region at the junction of 2 patterns is labeled as \u201cV\u2019 (which stands for Valley of the mmf distribution). In order to generate a uniform munf distribution over the planar energy transfer surface, two more layers of winding arrays should be added, This principle is explained firstly by adding a second layer of winding array to the first one as shown in Fig.20. The second layer is placed on the first one in such a way that the peak mmf positions (P) of the patterns of one layer are placed directly over the valley positions (V) of the pattems in the other layer. Fig.21 highlights the peak positions of the patterns that are directly over\n\nthe valley positions of the other layer for the two overlapped layers in Fig.20.\n\nIt can be observed from Fig.21, however, that the use of two layers of winding arrays, while presenting an improvement over a single layer, does not offer the optimal solution for generating uniform mmf over the inductive energy transfer surface. For each hexagonal pattern in the two-layer\n\n10\n\n20\n\n13\n\nstructure, the peak positions occupy the central position and three (out of six) vertices of each hexagon. The remaining three vertices are valley positions (V) that need to be filled by a third layer of winding arrays. These valley positions are shown in Fig.22 as empty squares.\n\nCareful examination of Fig.22 shows that there are six peak positions (P) surrounding cach valley position. Therefore, a third layer of a hexagonal winding array can be used to fill up all these remaining valley positions, By placing the central positions (peak mmf positions) of the hexagonal winding patterns of the third layer of the winding array over the remaining valley positions of the two-layer structure, an optimal three-layer structure is formed as shown in Fig.23. Fig.24 highlights the peak mmf positions of the three-layer structure. It can be observed that all central positions and vertices of all hexagonal patterns have peak mmf.\n\nthe surface has uniform mmf distribution, any distance\n\nthat the\n\nIn order to confirm mmf over between any two adjacent peak mmf positions can be considered as illustrated in Fig.25. If the winding patterns are excited in the same manner and polarity so that the mmf generated by cach layer of the winding array are always in the same direction at any moment, the resultant mmf is simply the sum of the mf generated by each layer. Fig.25 shows that the resultant mmy over the distance between any two adjacent peak positions in Fig.25 is equal to 1.0 per unit. This confirms that the proposed three-layer winding array structure can be used to generate highly uniform mmf over the inductive energy transfer surface. When used as a contactless, inductive cnergy transfer surface, this uniform mmf distribution feature ensures that, for a given airgap, a secondary coupling winding can always couple the same amount of magnetic flux regardless of the position of the\n\nsecondary element.\n\nIn another embodiment, the three-layer winding array structure can be constructed as a four- layer, with one of the four layers accommodating the return paths of the spiral windings to the electronic driving circuit.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n14\n\n\u2018a\n\nfarther\n\nA embodiment is based again on square spiral winding patterns. In this embodiment four layers of square-spiral winding arrays are used to generate highly uniform mmf over the surface. As in the hexagonal embodiment described above, for convenience of illustration each Square-spiral winding pattern (Fig.26) is simplified as a square symbol (Fig.27) in the following\n\ndescription.\n\nFig.28 shows the first layer of the square-spiral winding array, The myin the central region of each square patter is highest. These regions are highlighted as \u2018Peak\u2019 or (P) in Fig.29The regions of the minimum mmf (i.e. the valleys) occurs along the edges of the square patterns. These regions are highlighted with dots (*) in Fig.29,\n\nIn order to reduce the mmf ripples on the surface, the peak (P) positions of a second layer of square-spiral winding array can placed over some of the valley positions (*) as shown in Fig.30. When a third layer of square-spiral winding array is added to the structure in Fig.30, the resultant layout is shown in Fig.31.
