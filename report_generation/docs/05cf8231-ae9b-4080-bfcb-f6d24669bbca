The transparent resonator is mounted on said circuit so as to at least partially occupy a footprint of another component of the circuit. The transparent resonator forms part of a light pathway on said circuit for transmitting light to or from said another component. Also provided is a transparent dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) for optical applications. Since the DRA is transparent, it can let light pass through itself and, thus, the light can be utilized by an optical part of a system or device. The transparent DRA can be placed on top of a solar cell. Since the DRA does not block the light, the light can reach the solar cell panel and power can be generated for the system or device. The system or device so obtained is very compact because no extra foot- print is needed within the system or device for the DRA. It finds application in compact wireless applications that need a self-sustaining device.\n\n(65) Prior Publication Data\n\nUS 2011/0122036 Al May 26, 2011\n\n(51) Int.

The integration of a microstrip antenna and a solar cell panel usually causes the antenna gain to degrade significantly, although recent efforts have advanced the technology to increase the antenna gain of the solar-cell-integrated (metal- lic) microstrip antenna to ~1.05 dBi. However, this is still ~6 dB lower than that of metallic microstrip antennas. Moreover, the effective illumination area of the solar cell panel is some- what reduced because of introducing the non-transparent microstrip antenna. In order to solve this problem, it has been proposed to use a slot antenna, but this requires a removal of part of the solar cell panel which is undesirable.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates to a light transmissible resonator circuit and antenna applications and more particularly to dielectric resonator antenna having a light transmissable dielectric resonator element preferably shaped to focus light impinging on a surface of said resonator element.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nResonators have been widely used in microwave and mil- limeter wave circuits such as filters, oscillators and antennas, example. These components comprise important parts many wireless systems and devices, although their uses are confined to wireless applications.\n\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\n\nAn object of the invention is to provide a circuit including transparent resonator component mounted in the circuit to occupy at least a part of or the same footprint as another component of the circuit whilst allowing light impinging the resonator component to reach said another component.\n\na resonator (DR) can as a circuit element in oscillator and filter circuits, or as an effective radiator that is now commonly known as a DR antenna (DRA). In the past two decades, the DRA has been studied extensively due to a number of advantages it provides suchas its small size, low loss, low cost, light weight, and ease of excitation. DRAs are miniaturized antennas of ceramics or other dielectric media for microwave frequencies. DRAs are fabricated entirely from low loss dielectric materials and are typically mounted on ground planes. Their radiation charac- teristics are a function of the mode of operation excited in the DRA. The mode is generally chosen based upon operational requirements. DRAs offer several advantages over other antennas, such as small size, high radiation efficiency, and. simplified coupling schemes for various transmission lines. The bandwidth can be controlled over a wide range by the choice of dielectric constant, and the geometric parameters of\n\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a light trans- missable dielectric resonant antenna, e.g. a light transmissive transparent DRA.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to mitigate or obviate degree one or more problems associated with known microstrip antennas.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to mitigate or obviate some degree one or more problems associated with known resonator components or electronic devices or circuits includ- such resonator components.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to provide an electronic device which integrates or combines a solar cell or like device a light transmissable DRA.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a dual function antenna that additionally provides the function of a lens focusing light.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to improve wireless communication systems and devices.\n\nBy using a (DR), a an can be scaled down by roughly a factor of ve, where &, is the dielectric constant of the DR element material. This can be very useful in reducing the antenna size, particularly in wire- less communication applications. Today, compactness has become one of the topmost priorities in developing wireless communication devices and systems, supporting the devel- opment of multifunction components to miniaturize the devices and systems. As a result, there has been a trend to bundle several microwave functions into a single module, e.g. to combine several microwave resonators to provide multiple functions. It has also been shown to design a microstrip single-resonator balun-filter. Furthermore, it has recently been shown to design an antenna and filter using a single DR. Also, it has been demonstrated that the DRA can be integrated with an oscillator circuit.\n\nOne skilled in the art will derive from the following description other objects of the invention.

The transparent reso- nator may be mounted on the circuit so as to at least partially occupy a footprint of another component of the circuit. The transparent resonator may be mounted on said circuit such that it comprises a part of a light pathway for said another component so as to allow light impinging on said resonator component to reach said another component or to allow light generated by said another component to be transmitted away from said another component. In one particular embodiment a dual function transparent, shaped (preferably hemispheri- cal) DRA that simultaneously functions as an antenna and a focusing lens for a solar cell is provided. To make the system compact, the solar cell is placed beneath the DRA to save the footprint on the ground plane or grounded substrate of the DRA. The DRA can also serve as a protective cover for the solar cell. A conformal strip or feedline strip is used to excite the transparent, shaped DRA in its dominant TE,,, mode.

The transparent microstrip antenna has been studied for optical applications, but having a highly conducting transparent film is still a challenging problem. As the conductivity of the conductive transparent film (~5x10\u00b0 S/m) is relatively low as compared with that of metals, most of the transparent planar antennas reported thus far have an antenna gain of lesser than 0 dBi. It has been proposed to apply conductive paste to the slot edge of the transparent microstrip antenna for improving the radiation efficiency. Using this technique, the antenna gain has been increased from about -5 dBi to ~0 dBi, but at the cost of reducing the transparency of the antenna.\n\nfor\n\na\n\nfor\n\nof\n\nnot\n\nIt is also known that\n\ndielectric\n\nbe used.\n\nthe resonator.\n\ndielectric resonator\n\nsize of\n\nantenna\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\na\n\nso\n\nas\n\non\n\nor\n\nto\n\nsome\n\ntransparent\n\nto\n\ning\n\nwith\n\nfor\n\nThe present invention provides a circuit for an electronic\n\noutput voltage and current of the solar cell.

For ease of comparison with the focus- ing DRA 112 of FIGS. 2a and 24, the rectangular DR 16 was designed to resonate at the resonance frequency of its hemi- spherical counterpart of FIGS. 2a and 2b. The DR 16 was excited in its fundamental broadside TE,,, mode using a vertical excitation strip. FIGS. la and 16 shows the configu- ration, with \u00a9 =7, W=50 mm, H=22 mm, g=2 mm, d=1.57 mm, w,=12 mm, and 1,=22 mm. The same masked solar cell was used again in this investigation.\n\noptical measurement of the solar cell with the DRAs 12, 112, and, assisted by a prism 215, parallel blue light beams at a wavelength of 488 nm were generated. The laser 210 was tuned and provided an even light power of 130 mW to the DRA. To measure the outputs of the solar cell at different illumination angles (0), the DRA was placed ona rotator 200, as shown in FIG. 8. FIG. 9 shows the measured output voltage and current of the solar cell for the hemispherical DRA 112 as function of 8, respectively. Also shown in the figure are the outputs without the DRA. With reference to the figure, larger outputs can be obtained for 0<300 by using the DRA because of its focusing effect. With the hemispherical DR 116, the output voltage and current are increased by 13.5% and 27.2% at 0=0\u00b0, respectively. A smaller exposure radius ofR =5 mm was also used for the mask. Again, larger outputs were obtained for 6<30\u00b0 when the DR is present. In this case, the voltage and current outputs at 0=0? were increased by 11% and 21.4% with the use of the DR, respectively. The curves, however, are not included here for brevity. In practical appli- cations, the solar cell can be associated with a mechanical rotator so that it can track the light source if needed. In this case, the proposed DRA can be designed into a phased array\n\nof the prototype configurations, and measurements were car- ried out using the Agilent 8753 to verify the results. The effect of the airgap g between the DRA and substrate is studied first without considering the solar cell, ic. with no solar cell present. FIG. 3 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the hemispherical DRA 112 of FIGS. 2a and 26 for g=0 and 2 mm, and reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated results is observed for each case. With reference to FIG. 3, it can be seen that the airgap causes the measured resonant frequency and impedance bandwidth (IS, ,|s-10 dB) to increase from 1.92 GHz to 2.26 GHz and from 14% to 19%, respectively. The antenna gains of the two prototype DRAs (g=0 and g=2 mm) of FIGS. 1 and 2, respec- tively, were measured and found to be in the range of 4-6.8 dBi across their passbands. It was observed that a DRA with an airgap has a wider gain bandwidth, which is to be expected. It is found that the antenna gain is ~5 dBi around the reso- nance for each case, which is typical for a DRA. The simu- lated and measured radiation patterns for g=0 for the hemi- spherical DRA 112 are shown in FIG. 4. As can be observed from the figure, the co-polarized fields of both the E- and H-planes are stronger than the cross-polarized fields by more than 20 dB in the boresight direction (6=0?). The radiation pattern for g=2 mm was also simulated and measured and\n\ntransparent are now discussed. FIG. 10 shows the simulated and mea- sured reflection coefficients, whereas their corresponding input impedances are shown in the inset. With reference to the figure, the measured and simulated resonance frequencies of the rectangular DRA 12 are given by 1.91 GHzand 1.86 GHz, ively, with an error of 2.70%. For the impedance band- measured and simulated values are 17.6% and 15.8%, respectively. The resonance due to the solar cell is observed again in the measured result. Its resonance fre- quency slightly shifts from 2.25 GHz to 2.23 GHz due to the changes of the dielectric and excitation-strip loadings. The antenna gain of the transparent rectangular DRA 12 was also measured. It was found to be ~4.2 dBi around the resonance. The simulated and measured radiation patterns are shown in FIG. 11. As can be observed from the figure, the crosspolar- ized fields are weaker than the co-polarized ones by more than 25 dB in the boresight direction, showing that the rectangular DRA 12 has a very good polarization purity. FIG. 12 shows the measured output voltage and current using the same solar cell with R,=15 mm. With reference to the figure, the rectan- gular DR 16 does not increase the outputs of the solar cell, suggesting that the rectangular DR 16 can be used for appli- cations that do not require the focusing function. From the result, the focusing ability of the hemispherical DR 116 can be verified. Although the rectangular DR 16 does not provide the focusing function, its angular range for light reception is wider than its hemispherical counterpart, and the drop in its transparency above the solar cell is much smaller than the\n\nwith the underlaid solar cell 114 (FIG. 2) are investigated. FIG. 5 shows the simulated and measured reflection coeffi- cients of the configuration. As can be observed from the figure, the measured and simulated resonant frequencies of the DRA 112 are 1.94 GHz and 1.89 GHz, respectively, with an error of 2.65%. The measured and simulated impedance bandwidths are given by 16.5% and 22.8%, respectively. Although the DR 116 in this case also has a displacement of 2 mm from the substrate as for the previous one with the airgap, its measured resonant frequency (1.94 GHz) is lower than that of the airgap case (2.26 GHz). This is because the solar cell 114 increases the effective dielectric constant of the DR 116. It is interesting to note that the measured resonant frequency (1.94 GHz) is quite close to that of the DRA (1.92 GHz) resting on the ground plane (g=0). With reference to the figure, a small resonant mode was measured at 2.25 GHz. This mode is caused by the solar cell, which can be verified by the fact that it was still observed when the rectangular DR was used. The simulated result does not predict this resonance mode, which is not surprising because the exact dielectric\n\nThe dual or multi-function transparent hemispherical DRA 112 made of Borosilicate Crown Glass simultaneously func- tions as a radiating element and an optical focusing lens.

Because of the focusing effect of the DR 116, the voltage and current outputs of the solar cell can be increased. The system\n\nFIG. 6 shows the measured antenna gains of the hemi- spherical DRA 112 with and without the underlaid solar cell.

In the case of the combined DRA and optical component module 315a, the DRA acts as a signal radiator, i.e. antenna, for the transmit chain 320. The optical compo- nent may comprise a solar cell for generating power for the electronic system 300 or a lamp or LED for generating a light output signal for the system 300. In the former case, the DRA comprises a DR according to the invention as depicted by FIG. 1 or 2 and, in the latter case, the DRA comprises a DR according to the invention as depicted by FIG. 14 as herein- after described.\n\nis very compact for the solar cell does not need any extra footprint. The second configuration that uses a transparent rectangular DR 16 is more suitable for applications that do not want the focusing effect.\n\nof the invention comprise DRAs 12, 112, it will be understood that the principles described herein apply equally to any cir- cuit for an electronic device or system employing a DR for whatever purpose such as filter or oscillator circuits. Impor- tant aspects of the invention include mounting a generally non-planar transparent DR on a circuit to perform a normal known function of said DR. The DR is mounted on another component so as to at least partially occupy a footprint of another component of the circuit. The another component is preferably a light processing component, namely a compo- nent such as a solar cell that processes received light to generate an electrical output or a light generating device such as a lamp or an LED that converts electrical energy to light energy. As such, by mounting the DR in the manner proposed, the DR can act as a protective cover for the light processing component whilst allowing light to pass therethough and even enhance the performance of the light processing component. In fact, where the DR is shaped as a lens or the like, it can act to enhance the performance of the light processing element by concentrating light energy onto a selected area. Further- more, the DR does not require its own footprint thereby saving space on the circuit which is very useful in the design and manufacture of compact device such as wireless commu- nication devices, although the invention is not limited to only\n\nreformatting or retrieving module 331 optionally followed by a decoding module 332. The decoding module 332 is fol- lowed by a demodulator 333 and a signal receiving module 334. The wireless signal receive chain 330 is completed by a combined DRA and optical component module 3154. Again, one skilled in the art will understand the functionality and purpose of each of the modules comprising the wireless sig- nal receive chain 330. In the case of the combined DRA and optical component module 3154, the DRA acts as a signal radiator, ie. antenna, for the receive chain 330. The optical component may comprise a solar cell for generating power for the electronic system 300 ora lamp or LED for generating a light output signal for the system 300. Again, in the former case, the DRA comprises a DRA according to the invention as depicted by FIGS. 1 and 2 and, in the latter case, the DRA comprises a DRA according to the invention as depicted by FIG. 14 as hereinafter described. It will be appreciated that one of the combined modules 315a,b may comprise an optical component such as a solar cell for generating power for the electronic system 300 and the other may comprise a light generating means such as a lamp of an LED for said system\n\nin accordance with the invention. It will be understood that the DRAs of FIG. 1 or 2 could be employed in a suitable electronic device or system such as a mobile wireless handset, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or even a wireless base station. In fact, where the electronic device comprises a DRA incorporated with a solar cell, the device might comprise any electronic device requiring both a self-contained power source and an ability to wirelessly communicate with other devices or systems. For example, a parking meter having a solar power cell and DRA combination according to the invention would have a self-contained power source for oper- ating the meter and a means of communicating wirelessly to say a control centre when the meter needs emptied or main- tained or the like. The electronic system 300 of FIG. 13 comprises a housing 310 containing control and operational circuitry and at least one combined solar cell and DRA mod- ule 315 according to the invention whereby light impinging on the housing 310 is conveyed to a solar cell (not shown) of the at least one module 315 by its DRA.
