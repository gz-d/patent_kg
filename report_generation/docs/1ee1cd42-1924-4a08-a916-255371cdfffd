The invention also relates to a communication device that includes the filter-antenna.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nFilters and antennas are common and important components in communication filter-antenna (or filtering-antenna) is a device that combines an antenna and a filter.\n\ndevices. A\n\nExisting filter-antennas are reflective filter-antennas. These reflective filter-antennas reflect most of the incident energy in the stopband. The reflected energy may be transferred to other components (e.g., a power amplifier associated with the filter-antenna) in the system, which may lead to instability (e.g., self-oscillation in the power amplifier). One option to avoid or mitigate this instability problem is to use isolators, circulators, and/or attenuators in the system to reduce the effect of the reflected energy on the system. However, this option would increase the number of the components in the system, making the system cumbersome and expensive while potentially increasing the insertion loss.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIn accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a filter-antenna, comprising a microstrip antenna integrated with an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. By absorbing or dissipating the energy, e.g., energy received from an external source, reflection of energy (which may otherwise affect stability of other components/devices) can be prevented, reduced, or eliminated. The filter-antenna can be used for transmission, receiving, or both.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip antenna is a patch antenna.

The filter-antenna 20 1s operably connected with a signal (e.g., energy) source 10 such as a power amplifier to receive a signal (e.g., energy) from the signal source 10. The filter-antenna 20 includes a bandpass channel 22BP and a band-stop channel 22BS. The bandpass channel 22BP is connected with an antenna element 24. The band-stop channel 22BS is connected with a filter element 26 illustrated as a resistor. The energy in the passband received at the bandpass channel 22BP is transmitted to the antenna element 24; the energy in the stopband received at the band-stop channel 22BS is absorbed or dissipated by the resistor 26. Thus, the energy reflection in both the\n\n3A\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n6\n\npassband and the stopband is reduced, minimized, and preferably substantially eliminated, to avoid possible detrimental effects on neighboring components (e.g., the power amplifier).\n\nFigures 2A to 2D illustrate a filter-antenna 200 in one embodiment of the invention. The filter-antenna 200 generally includes a microstrip antenna integrated with an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. In this embodiment, the microstrip antenna is a patch antenna and the absorptive filter 1s a band-stop filter for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy.\n\nAs shown in Figures 2A to 2D, the filter-antenna 200 includes a substrate 202, a patch network 204 formed by conductive patches on an upper face of the substrate 202, and a ground plane 206 formed by a conductive surface on a lower face of the substrate 202. The substrate 202 has a dielectric constant g,s. The substrate 202 has a thickness (in z-direction) t, and an area (in x-y plane) of G x G. A coaxial connector or feed connector 208, with an inner cable of radius 7, is attached to the lower surface of the substrate 202 and penetrates through the substrate 202 to connect with a patch 204A of the patch network 204. The cable feed 208 is soldered to the patch 204A for exciting the filter-antenna 200.\n\nAs best shown in Figures 2A and 2B, the patch network 204 includes a main patch 204A and two side patches 204B, 204C arranged on respective sides of the main patch 204A. The main patch 204A includes a central portion 204A1 and two side portions 204A2, 204A3 arranged on two sides of the central portion 204A1. The central portion 204A1 includes two generally U-shaped slots 220 disposed symmetrically about an axis of symmetry (in x-direction) of the main patch 204A. Each of the U-shaped slots 220 is associated with a respective open stub (surrounded by a dotted loop near 220), a Ag/4 open stub (A, is the guided wavelength). Each of the side portions 204A2, 204A3 include a dual-stub or a dual-stub feed 222. Each dual stub feed 222 include stubs of lengths of Le and L, (Le > L-) separated by width W,. The two stubs have the same width of We. The central portion 204A1 is connected with the feed 208 at one end and with a resistor element 1n the other end.\n\n214\n\nThe two side patches 204B, 204C are parasitic slotted patches. Each of the patches 204B, 204C is generally rectangular and includes a rectangular slot. The two side patches 204B, 204C are symmetrically disposed about the axis of symmetry (in x-direction) of the main patch 204A. The two side patches 204B, 204C are also aligned with the main patch 204A in that their top edges (in the x-direction) are on the same level and their bottom edges (in the x-direction) are on the same level. Each of the slotted patches 204B, 204C has a length of La and width of W4, and ls respectively spaced apart from the edge of the main patch 204A by a distance Si. The rectangular slot has a length of Lp and width of ol\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\nFigure 2D shows the ground plane 206. The ground plane 206 is generally a flat conductive surface with three slots. At the center of the ground plane 206, which, In plan view, correspond to the main patch 204A is a U-shaped slot, a A,/2 U-shaped slot 230 formed (e.g., etched) in the ground plane 206. Two generally-n shaped side slots 232 are arranged on two sides of the U- shaped slot 230 to improve the suppression level of the lower stopband.\n\nFigure 2C shows the filter element 214 at least partly arranged inside the substrate 202. In this embodiment, the filter element 214 1s a chip resistor embedded in the substrate 202 (a small hole formed in the substrate 202) for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy. The chip resistor has a resistance of 47Q. One end of the chip filter is soldered to the main patch 204A whereas the other end of the chip filter is soldered to the ground plane 206.\n\nThe filter-antenna 200 of Figures 2A to 2D includes a filter integrated into the patch antenna. The filter is formed by a defected microstrip structure arranged in the microstrip network 204, the chip resistor 214, and a defected ground structure arranged in the ground plane 206. The defected microstrip structure includes the stubs and slots 220 arranged in the central portion 204A1. The defected ground structure includes the slots 230, 232 formed ln the ground plane 206. The filter can be considered as a resistor-terminated band-stop filter (BSF) 210.\n\nFigure 3 shows\n\na\n\nmethod 300 for making a\n\nfilter-antenna in\n\none\n\nembodiment of the\n\ninvention. The filter-antenna could be the one in Figures 2A to 2D. The method 300 includes, step 302, forming a microstrip antenna, and in step 304, integrating, in the microstrip antenna, absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. The two steps 302, 304 may be carried out the order stated, or simultaneously. The microstrip antenna may be a patch antenna. In one example, forming the microstrip antenna includes processing a PCB substrate (substrate + metallic layers on opposite faces of the substrate). Specifically forming the microstrip antenna may include forming a microstrip network on a first face of a substrate of the microstrip antenna, forming defected microstrip structure ln the microstrip network, and/or forming a defected ground structure on a ground plane on a second, opposite face of the microstrip antenna. The absorptive filter may be integrated in the substrate by forming (e.g., drilling) a hole in the substrate, then arranging the filter element in the hole. The filter element of the absorptive filter can be arranged substantially completely in the hole. Electric connections between the filter element and the ground plane may be formed by soldering or welding. Likewise, Electric connections between the\n\nin\n\nan\n\nin\n\na\n\nfilter element and the microstrip network may be formed by soldering or welding.\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n8\n\nFigures 4A and 4B show the prototype 400 of a filter-antenna fabricated based on the antenna 200 of Figures 2A to 2D. Dimensions of the prototype 400 are listed in the following table.\n\nfilter-\n\nTABLE I: DIMENSIONS OF THE FILTER-ANTENNA PROTOTYPE\n\na\n\nTe pe pe pe ps |e | 0.75 mm O.7 mm 2.15 mm | 9.95 mm 9.8 mm 2.7mm 11.6 mm (075mm | 07mm | 215mm | 995mm | 98mm | 27mm | 1.6mm a INCN NON NOCN\n\nExperiments and simulations had been performed to verify the performance of the filter- antenna 400. The experiments performed includes measuring reflection coefficient using an Agilent\u2122 8753ES vector network analyzer, and measuring radiation pattern, antenna gain, and antenna efficiency using a Satimo\u2122 StarLab System.\n\nFigure 5 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the filter-antenna 400 and reflection coefficient of a reference antenna. As shown in Figure 5, the measured result generally agrees with the simulated result. The measured reflection coefficient 1s below -10 dB over the entire frequency range (5 \u4e00 6.5 GHz). This demonstrates the reflection-less characteristic of the filter-antenna 400. It is noted that the reflection coefficient of the filter-antenna 400 does not have a sharp selectivity. For comparison, a conventional rectangular patch antenna having the same length of La and width of W; is included here as the reference antenna. Its simulated reflection coefficient is also shown in Figure 5. It can be seen from Figure 5 that the impedance bandwidth of the reference antenna is much narrower than that of the filter-antenna 400 although the reference antenna and filter-antenna 400 have the same patch size.\n\nGHz.\n\nFigures 6A and 6B show the measured and simulated normalized radiation patterns at As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, the maximum co-polar field is found in the boresight\n\n5.8\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n9\n\ndirection (@ = 0?). It is stronger than its cross-polar counterpart by more than 22 dB. The measured H-plane radiation pattern (yz-plane, \u00a2 = 90\u00b0) is not symmetric although the filter-antenna 400 is symmetric about the xz-plane. This may be caused by experimental imperfections including assembly errors. It was found that the radiation patterns are stable over the targeted ISM band (5.725\u20145.875 GHz) (results not illustrated).\n\nFigure 7 shows the measured and simulated realized antenna gains in the boresight direction (9 = 0\u00b0). With reference to Figure 7, the measured and simulated results are in good agreement. The measured maximum realized gain is 7.28 dBi at 5.8 GHz, which is 0.78 dB lower than the simulated peak gain (8.06 dBi) at 5.94 GHz due to experimental tolerances. The measured realized antenna gain is higher than 7 dBi from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a measured 1-dB gain bandwidth (gain > 6.28 dBi) of 5.86% (5.63\u2014-5.97 GHz). In the upper stopband, two measured radiation nulls with low antenna gains of around -23.5 dBi, along with a sharp roll-off rate for the upper band-edge, are observed. The measured out-of-band suppression level is more than 20.5 dB in the upper stopband (6.12\u20146.50 GHz). In the lower stopband (5.00-\u20145.44 GHz), another two radiation nulls are measured at 5.41 GHz and below 5.0 GHz, respectively, leading to a suppression level of more than 17.4 dB. The antenna gain of the reference antenna is also shown in the same figure to highlight the filtering characteristic of the filter-antenna 400 of the above embodiment.\n\nFigure 8 shows the measured and simulated total antenna efficiency (mismatch included) of the filter-antenna 400. With reference to Figure 8, the measured efficiency is higher than 72.5% from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a maximum of 78.5% at 5.74 GHz. The simulated peak efficiency is 89.7% at 5.98 GHz. The efficiency decreases rapidly on the band-edge and then becomes small in the stopbands, giving a sharp selectivity. Since the antenna 200, 400 is matched across the entire band (5-6.5 GHz), it can be inferred that the energy is mostly dissipated in the chip resistor in the antenna stopbands. This illustrates that a well-matched antenna does not necessarily radiate effectively. Again, the simulated result of the reference patch antenna is included in Figure 8. As expected, the reference patch antenna does not have any sharp filtering response.\n\nThe simulated power loss In the chip resistor 1s shown in Figure 9. The results In Figure 9 have been normalized with respect to the maximum at 5.24 GHz. With reference to Figure 9, the normalized power loss 1s lower than 0.12 ln the 1-dB gain passband (5.63\u20145.97 GHz) and higher than 0.85 ln the stopbands (5.00\u20145.44 GHz and 6.12\u20146.50 GHz) with sharp band-edge selectivity. It should be noted that the frequency response of the normalized power loss in Figure 9 is almost complementary to that of the simulated efficiency in Figure 8. This suggests that the band-stop filter and the filtering patch antenna have generally-complementary transfer functions, which are required to reduce or eliminate reflection.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n10\n\nThe above embodiments of the invention have generally provided a filter-antenna that can\n\neffectively reduce reflection of energy, In particular energy in the stopband. The filter-antenna 1s compact, low-profile, and small, and ls suitable for miniature communication devices and systems. The above embodiments of the invention can be used ln the wireless transmitter to reduce the system size and loss. The filter-antenna in the above embodiment has four radiation nulls that can be tuned independently to facilitate the design. A resistor-terminated band-stop filter 1s embedded at the center of the patch antenna to absorb the energy in the stopbands. The band-stop filter consists of a defected ground structure, a defected microstrip structure, along with the chip resistor. is achieved in the and in the\n\nGood impedance matching\n\npassband\n\nstopband.\n\nThe filter-antenna in the above embodiments may reduce, avoid, or prevent the energy in the stopband from reflecting back to the source or other components, by absorbing or dissipating the energy through a filter (esp., resistor). The energy in the passband is transmitted to the antenna, whereas the energy ln the stopbands 1s absorbed by the filter (esp., resistor). As a result, the energy reflection is greatly reduced or even eliminated in both the passband and stopbands, which avoid possible detrimental effects on the source or other components.\n\nIt will be appreciated by person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the invention should therefore be considered in all respects as illustrative, not restrictive.\n\nFor example, the filter-antenna need not be a patch antenna but can be other forms of\n\nmicrostrip antennas. The substrate of the antenna can be formed by one or more substrate layers, the same or different dielectric constants (\u20ac;s). The dielectric constant of the substrate layer can vary. The shape, form, and size of the substrate; the shape, form, and size of the ground plane; and shape, form, and size of the microstrip network or patch network can be different. The patch network can have any number of (at least one) patches with any of shape and form. The patch(es) need not necessarily be arranged symmetrically.
