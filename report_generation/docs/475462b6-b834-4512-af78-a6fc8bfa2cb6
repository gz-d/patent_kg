However, this implies the use of perfect anchorages that can sustain fatigue loading. Furthermore, external tendons can be very vulnerable to vandalism, and should they fail they will release an enormous amount of elastic energy that can be devastating;\n\nThis invention relates to structural members, such as for example reinforced concrete beams and columns, and in par- ticular to such structural members that are provided with improved ductility.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND\n\nPRIOR ART\n\nDesigning the interface between the FRP reinforcement and the concrete so that a bond failure is triggered when stress in the tendons reaches a threshold level, thus changing bonded tendon configuration to an unbonded tendon con- figuration; and\n\nConcrete is a brittle material. Concrete structures rely largely on the deformation and yielding of the tensile rein- forcement to satisfy the ductility demand. The widespread application of high strength steel reinforcement in concrete structures has a significant drawback from a ductility point of view due to a lower degree of strain hardening and smaller ultimate elongation of the high strength steel. The application of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement encounters a similar problem, as FRPs have a low strain capacity and linear elastic stress-strain behavior up to rupture without yielding. The ductility of concrete members reinforced with non-duc- tile bars, especially FRP reinforced concrete (RC) members, has been a major concern in the studies of reinforced concrete structures in recent years.\n\nDesigning the cross-section of a member to proportionate reinforcement in order to take the advantage of the full strain capacity of concrete simultaneously with that of reinforcement.\n\nThe success of such methods will vary depending on specific application. However they are often considered either complicated, too time consuming, overly expensive, not very effective (i.e. limited increase in ductility).\n\nCurvature, and hence flexural deformation, are due to ten- sile and compression straining at a cross-section. When ten- sion yielding/deformation is unavailable, another avenue of achieving ductility/deformability is by compression yielding/ deformation. In principle, all the methods of achieving flex- ural ductility/deformability of RC members must fall into these two categories.\n\nConventional RC members reinforced with ductile bars also have ductility problems when the failure is caused by the compressive crushing of concrete in which the tensile rein- forcement does not yield. This occurs in over-reinforced RC beams and RC columns with a high axial load level. In this case the ductility and deformability of RC members are sig- nificantly reduced, although significant confinement to con- crete can partially offset this reduction. The more the tensile reinforcement in an RC beam, the less the tensile reinforce- ment deforms and hence the lower the deformability and ductility of the member. Similarly, the higher the axial load level in an RC column, the lower the ductility. Furthermore, the use of more brittle high strength concrete (HSC), which has been increasing in a fast rate over the last two decades, has a similar detrimental side-effect on the ductility of reinforced. concrete members especially for concrete columns.\n\nIt would be desirable to produce improved or alternative flexural members that overcame the problems associated with flexural members in the prior art.\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\nThe applicants have discovered that replacing the concrete the compression zone of the plastic hinge with a strong ductile material or mechanism leads to an increase ductility of a flexural member.\n\nAccording to the present invention therefore there is pro- vided a flexural member having a plastic hinge region or nearby region defined by tension and compression zones when subject to a bending moment, wherein said compres- sion zone is provided with means for increasing the compres- sion yielding of the compression zone.\n\nDuctility of structures is important to ensure large defor- mation and give sufficient warning while maintaining an adequate load carrying capacity before structural failure, so that total collapse may be prevented and lives saved. Ductility is also the basis of modern structural design approaches (e.g. moment redistribution). In seismic design, in particular, duc- tility becomes an extremely important consideration. The issue of ductility and methods of increasing ductility is one of the most active areas in the study of concrete structures. There are a number of existing approaches used to improve the structural ductility of FRP reinforced concrete members, some of them are equally applicable to steel reinforced con- crete members:\n\nIn one broad aspect of the present invention there is pro- vided a flexural member wherein at least a portion of the material in the compression zone of the plastic hinge or near the plastic hinge comprises a ductile compressive material. In particular the flexural member may comprise concrete, for example FRP bar or steel bar reinforced concrete, such as a concrete structural member such as a beam or column. Pref- erably the ductile compressive material comprises elasto- plastic or nearly elasto-plastic material. Possible materials for the ductile compressive material include metallic materials such as steel and alloys, cementitious material, plastics, elas- tomeric materials such as rubber, rubber cement material, composite material or combinations thereof.\n\nProviding confinement to concrete. Confinement increases ductility/deformability of concrete, however, this method cannot avoid the rupture of non-ductile bars for under-rein- forced beams. For over-reinforced beams or columns with significant axial load, heavy and excessive confinement rein- forcement is usually needed to achieve the ductility require- ment;\n\nAnother method of producing a very ductile compression zone is by providing or forming holes (such as voids bubbles) inside normal concrete or inside other materials such as plastic materials, metallic materials, composite mate- rials or other materials.\n\nPlacing prestressed reinforcement in layers and design the effective prestress in each layer so as to provide a step-by-step progressive failure with increasing deformation.

In particu- lar the flexural member may comprise concrete, for example FRP bar or steel bar reinforced concrete, such as a concrete structural member such as a beam or column.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nIt is known that when large flexural deformation occurs in a structural member (hereafter referred to as a \u201cflexural mem- ber\u201d), the plastic deformation is mainly concentrated in a small area called the \u201cplastic hinge\u201d zone that has a limited length. When large rotations of the plastic hinge cannot be achieved through elongation or tensile yielding of the rein- forcement on the tension side, the other way to achieve it is by shortening or compression yielding on the opposite compres- sion side.\n\nPreferably the mechanism is made from steel or other metallic materials, FRP, composite, plastic, cementitious material, elastomeric material or combinations thereof, mechanism may be encased in a protective material a lightweight concrete or other low strength materials.\n\nAs shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the present invention provides additional ductility to a flexural member 10 through the new concept of compression yielding by utilizing a compression yielding device. Means for achieving increased compression yielding in a plastic hinge 20 of a flexural member 10 include the use of a compression yielding device, in particular:\n\nThe encased mechanism may be cast or installed into flexural member to form a ductile compression zone.\n\nViewed from another broad aspect the invention also pro- vides a method of modifying a flexural member comprising casting an amount of ductile compressive material into the compression zone of the plastic hinge or near the plastic hinge the flexural member.\n\ncompression yielding device comprising ductile com- pression material 30 that replaces concrete 15 within ductile compression zone 40 (such as that shown in 1); and\n\nViewed from another broad aspect the invention also pro- vides a method of modifying a flexural member comprising inserting a ductile compressive mechanism into the compres- sion zone of the plastic hinge of the flexural member or nearby to the plastic hinge.\n\n2) A compression yielding device comprising a ductile mechanism 50 within the compression zone 40 (such as that shown in FIG. le and FIG. 2).\n\nThe invention may also broadly be said to consist in any alternative combination of features as described or shown in the accompanying examples. Known equivalents of these features not expressly set out are nevertheless deemed to be included.\n\nBoth types of compression yielding devices should satisfy the following general principles: i) deforming elastically (or almost elastically) at the serviceability limit state to ensure low creep deformation, sufficient rigidity and other good working conditions; ii) deforming plastically (or almost plas- tically) at the ultimate limit state to ensure sufficient ductility; and iii) the total compressive strength C is not greater than the total tensile strength T to ensure no tensile breaking of the non-ductile bars.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying in which:\n\nIt would be desirable to place the ductile compression material 30 or mechanism 50 at the plastic hinge location 20. However, the locations of plastic hinges may vary with dif- ferent flexural members. Nevertheless, the ductile compres- sion zone 40 need not coincide exactly with the position of the maximum moment. In fact, the ductile compression zone 40 acts as a fuse in the structural system, and when excessive loading condition occurs, the fuse will be triggered and force the structural system to deform in a (more or less) plastic manner to avoid abrupt reinforcement rupture or concrete crushing.\n\nFIGS. la to 1f show schematic longitudinal and cross sec- of different embodiments of one aspect of the present invention.\n\nFIGS. 2a to 2c show side views of embodiments of second aspect of the invention.\n\nFIGS. 3a and 4 show an elevation detail of tested speci- mens, with FIG. 34 showing the reinforced concrete beam containing a ductile compression mechanism, and FIG. 3a showing the reference beam constructed by a conventional method.\n\n4 shows the load vs. deformation curve for the of the mechanism used in Example 3.\n\npression yielding is by casting a block of elasto-plastic (duc- tile) material 30 into the compression zone 40 of the plastic hinge 20. Good deformability of materials may come together with the high tendency to creep that will result in significant long-term deflections. In such a case, an additional elastic compression component, such as additional normal concrete 15 (see FIG. 1c) or additional compression bars or plates 17 (see FIG. 1d) can be used in the plastic hinge 20 on top of the compression zone 40 to provide sufficient elasticity and rigid- ity at service loads. The additional elastic compression com- ponent will give up at ultimate load (by crushing of the top concrete 15 in case of FIG. 1c or by buckling of the bars or\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates the test setup used in the Examples.\n\nFIG. 6a shows a graph of the load vs. mid-span displace- ments of the flexural members tested in the Examples, while FIG. 66 illustrates the setup in Example 3 after the test had concluded.\n\nFIG. 7 is a graph depicting the parameters of the definition of ductility in the context of this invention.\n\nFIG. 8 is a graph showing the measured plastic hinge deformation in Example 3, with the elongation of the bar showing the tensile deformation of reinforcement bars, and compression shortening of the mechanism showing the com- pression deformation, within the plastic hinge zone.\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nsuch\n\nas\n\nthe\n\nof\n\nby drawings,\n\ntions\n\na\n\nFIG. results\n\ntest\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nof the the\n\n1)A\n\nFIG,\n\nReferring to FIGS. 1a-1d, one means of achieving com-\n\nplate 17 in case of FIG. 1d) and pass the compression load to\n\nUS 8,656,685 B2\n\n6\n\n5\n\nthe compressible material 30 so that sufficient ductility can be\n\nties would be important for members with both tension and\n\ncompression yielding.

Referring to FIGS. la, lc & d, the addition of top and bottom reinforcement bars 18a and 185 and stirrups 19 surrounding the ductile block 60, separation between the concrete 15 and the ductile material 30 can be avoided.\n\n(2)\n\nReferring to FIG. le and FIG. 2, the other means of achiev- ing compression yielding is by using a ductile mechanism 50. Both steel and FRP materials can be used to design and make ductile mechanism 50. There is no technical problem design and make a steel mechanism 50 and the requirement is that it should be as simple and as inexpensive as possible. Examples ofa steel mechanism 50 that has been tested in such away is shown in FIG. 2. A similar mechanism 50 made from FRP material may be used in special cases where non-mag- netic and non-corrosive material is required. The mechanism 50 can be encased into a protective material such as light weight concrete that may form a precast block 60. This pre- cast block 60 can be then cast into the beam 10 to form a ductile compression zone 40 as shown in FIG. le.\n\nwhere k, K,, and k,,, are the total, elastic and plastic curvature, respectively; L is the span of the beam; A, is the displacement due to the elastic deformation; and A, is the displacement due the plastic deformation.\n\nThe elastic deformation A, can be calculated with the con- ventional reinforced concrete theory. When plastic deforma- tion occurs, the elastic component reaches its maximum value of A,, or A.=A,. For plastic deformation, it is generally accepted in the literature that the plasticity concentrates in the plastic hinge zone that has a limited length of L, (Paulay and Priestley 1992). Therefore, k,=0 outside the plastic hinge zone. Assuming that the plastic curvature k, is constant inside the plastic hinge zone, then\n\nThe compression yielding only takes place inside the com- pression yielding zone. In order to achieve compression yielding in the plastic hinge 20, the concrete 15 on both sides of the compression yielding zone should be stronger than that of the compression yielding zone. On the other hand, tension yielding of reinforcement should be avoided in order to avoid. breaking of the non-ductile bars 18a. As a result, the plastic deformation takes place on the compression side and is con- fined inside the compression yielding zone. Hence the plastic hinge length 55 is simply the length of the compression yield- ing zone. This makes the determination of the plastic hinge length 55 much simpler than that for conventional reinforced. concrete (RC) members.\n\nL/2 = ae f (f std oo pf2 12 Lp!

This is reasonable for mem- bers in which the tensile deformation of bars contributes to most of their flexural deformation, e.g. the under-reinforced beams or columns with low axial load level. For members without significant tensile yielding, such as over-reinforced beams and columns with high axial load level, the properties of the tensile reinforcement apparently have no effect on the extent of yielding and the plastic hinge length 55. This con- clusion can be seen from the compression yielding system where the extent of plasticity and the plastic hinge length 55 is determined by the properties of the compression zone instead of that of the tension reinforcement. This analysis reveals the possible deficiency in the existing model of the plastic hinge length 55. Apparently, the plastic hinge length 55 is largely governed by the extent of tension yielding for under-reinforced beam and columms with low axial load level. For over-reinforced beam or columns with high axial load level in which no tension yielding occurs, the extent of com- pression plasticity, which is ignored in the existing model, plays an important role in the plastic hinge length 55.

Because only half the plastic hinge length con- tributes to the rotation relative to mid-span, the summation of the above three displacements, which are taken over the whole plastic hinge length, is divided by two in the equation. With an ideal elasto-plastic model as shown in FIG. 10(5), both the external load on the beam and the internal compres- sion force at the compression zone keeps constant at the plastic deformation stage.

However, it worked in a completely different way. Instead of relying on the tensile elongation of the web mem- ber 53 to provide compression shortening of the mechanism 50d, it relied on the compressive plastic buckling of the two chord plates 25 to provide the plastic shortening of the mecha- nism 50d. The tensile yielding of the web was prevented by using a 10mm thick mild steel plate 28 as the web member 53. The load vs. displacement response of this mechanism 506, with a steel plate 28 having a width of 70 mm, was obtained by compression test in a universal compression machine.

It can be seen clearly from the ideal model of FIG. 2a that the relation between the longitudinal displacement 4 and the compression force C is essentially elasto-plastic if the stress-strain relation of the web steel member 53 is elasto-plastic. It should be noted that \u201celasto-plastic\u201d refers to a load-deformation rela- tion where there is an elastic stage in which the deformation is in direct proportion to the load, followed by a plastic stage in which the deformation increases though the load remains constant. A mild steel plate was used to make the web member 53, and therefore, the stress-strain relation could be consid- ered as approximately elasto-plastic. Referring to FIG. 26, a first steel mechanism 50a was made from two 10 mm thick by 150 mm mild steel plates 25 that were bent and welded together at their ends. Four 12 mm mild steel bars 26 were used as the web member 53 that penetrated through and were bolted into the middle of the two bent steel plates 25, as shown in FIG. 24. The middle of the two plates 25 was grinded to reduce their thickness in order to reduce the moment resis- tance of the plate 25 at the joint.

However, in order to ensure no breaking of tension bars 18a, the width of the steel plate 28 was reduced from 70 mm to 59 mm. This beam performed satisfactorily (see FIG. 65) and a large yield pla- teau was achieved. The response curve is shown in FIG. 6a by \u201c$2\u201d.\n\ntest beam. Bearing in mind that the Young\u2019s modulus of the GFRP bars is relatively small compared to steel or CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) bars, a beam with steel or CFRP bars would have achieved a smaller elongation of the reinforcement than that of this test beam. These analyses show that the deformation/ductility contributed by tension straining is very limited and a significant ductility demand cannot be satisfied without significant compression deforma- tion/yielding for beams reinforced with non-ductile rein- forcement.\n\nDiscussion of Experimental Results\n\nThe ductility factor of a member, lu is defined as the mate displacement divided by the yield displacement, or\n\n_ Ae wey\n\nREFERENCES\n\nACI Committee 440, Guide for the Design and Construction of Concrete Reinforced with FRP Bars, American Concrete Institute, Farmington Hills, 2001.\n\nDifferent definitions of yield and ultimate displacements were used in the literature.

For this reason the width of the steel mechanism 2 was reduced for Example 3. This test also illustrated the cata- strophic nature of the tension failure mode. With the com- pression yielding scheme, the tensile failure can be easily avoided by ensuring the compression resistance to be smaller than the tensile resistance.
