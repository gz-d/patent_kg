The polarizer 104 is provided to select a content ratio between p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam components of the light source by rotat- ing a polarization angle of the polarizer 104. The polarization angle of the polarizer 104 is set at 45\u00b0 off to p-polarized beam optical axis to obtain an equal content in both p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam components.

As shown in FIG. 3, the interferometric unit 210 may be a typical birefringent inter- ferometer, which contains a broadband birefringent optical crystal 211. The orthogonal birefringent axes 212 of crystal 211 represent the ordinary ray (0-ray, arrow in upwards direc- tion) and extra-ordinary ray (e-ray, dot in the direction per- pendicular to the screen) respectively. The axes 212 are set in accordance with the incoming respective p-polarized beam 301 and s-polarized beam 302 for the birefringent optical path difference to be implemented correctly. For example, prior to traversing the crystal 211, p-polarized beam 301 and s-polar- ized beam 302 have zero optical path difference (OPD) as shown in FIG. 3. With birefringent axes 212 adjusted in line with respective polarized beams, i.e. p-polarized beam corre- sponds to the ordinary ray whereas s-polarized beam corre- sponds to the extra-ordinary ray, the two polarized beams experience different optical paths as they traverse the bire- fringent crystal.

The retardation between the two polarized. beams 303 and 304 due to birefringent crystal 211 is demon- strated in FIG. 3. The amount of retardation can be controlled by the thickness of the optical crystal 211.

In this case, a gold thin layer, nominally 48 nm thick, is employed because of its good chemical resistance. The target samples are sodium chloride solutions.

The broad- band linear polarizer 511 is adjusted to recombine the p- and s-polarized beams from the SPR sensing unit so as to generate spectral interferograms. The prober 512 is configured to obtain the interference spectrum of the recombined light beam.\n\nwhere ,,.ic-48 the time delay introduced by the liquid crystal variable retarder 221. Therefore, each pixel on the spectral CCD array of the prober 512 contains its own oscillation in the time domain. The SPR phase information is however preserved so that the differential phase can be extracted along the temporal dimension. Therefore, the higher the number of temporal cycle, the better is the accuracy of SPR phase extrac- tion. FIGS. 7b and 7c shows the addition of the electronic controlled liquid crystal variable retarder implemented according to an embodiment.\n\nThe prober 512 may contain a single channel spectral ana- lyzer 513 which may comprise a dispersive grating for sepa- rating a light beam into spatially dispersed wavelengths; and a detector array 514 have a plurality of pixels, each pixel for measuring an intensity oscillation signal for a wavelength of the dispersed wavelengths. The detector array 514 may be a linear charge-coupled device (CCD) detector array used to capture the spectral intensity oscillation of the recombined p- and s-polarized beams. The signal trace from the entire opti- cal detector array 514 contains all the information required for computing the spectral phase change and spectral inten- sity dip due to energy transformation associated with the SPR effect at all incident wavelengths at fixed angles.\n\nThe spectral intensity oscillation signals of the interference between p-polarized and s-polarized beams from the probe unit 510 can be processed by the processing unit 520 to determine the target sample characteristics by computing differential phase between the p-polarized and s-polarized beams to detect a refractive index change associate with the target sample. The processing unit 520 may comprise a per- sonal microcomputer or any other processor. It is employed to compute the differential phase between p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam directly. Subsequently, the refractive index change associated with the binding of biomolecules to the sensor surface can be found.\n\nThe intensity recorded by each pixel on the detector array a channeled interference spectrum as shown in FIG. 7a which can be described by the following equation\n\nsensing device according to an embodiment are given below with reference to FIGS. 9-11. In the embodiment, a WLED lamp of electrical power 20 Watt is employed and its polar- ized beam is regarded as random. Both the common-path interferometric unit and the carrier frequency modulation unit are adopted. The thickness of the birefringent crystal of the common-path interferometric unit is made of yttrium ortho- vanadate (YVO4), which predetermined as 630 micrometers and optimized for the spectrometer employed. The SPR and the LRSPR configurations are provided respectively for com- parison purpose. The sensor layer structures are a thin gold layer with 48 nm thickness for the SPR configuration and a gold/silicon dioxide/gold multi-layer stack with thicknesses of 48 nm, 620 nm and 2 nm respectively for the LRSPR configuration. The results indicate that for a 1\u00b0 spectral phase change the corresponding refractive changes are 8.53x1077 for the SPR configuration and 1.95x10 MU for the LRSPR configuration. This means that the detection resolution of the LRSPR configuration is approximately 44 times higher than that of the SPR configuration. FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 show simulation results of the spectral phase response from the SPR and LRSPR configurations, respectively, when they are incorporated in the wide dynamic range phase-sensitive SPR sensor. The incident angles used in this simulation is fixed at about 73.5\u00b0, and the resultant signal traces are detected by a 3648-elements optical spectral analyzer covering 600 nm to 800 nm with approximately 0.05 nm interval for both SPR and LRSPR configurations.

With the change of SPR wave- length due to refractive index alternation and a fixed birefrin- gent retardation introduced between the two polarized beams, the phase term \u7531 srR can be extracted with appropriate signal processing method to determine the change of refractive index.\n\nWhen the carrier frequency modulation technique is imple- mented, the intensity signal will reflect the phase stepping introduced by the retarder 221. For example, the retardation of the liquid crystal variable retarder 221 is alternated by the electronic controller 223. That is, the carrier frequency modu- lation 220 can introduce a time delay between the p-polarized and s-polarized components up to a for all the wavelengths interrogated before the polarized beams recombine at the exit of the interferometric path to the detection unit 500, so that each pixel of the detector array of the prober 512 can detect its own temporal oscillation. That is, the optical detector pixel array can be a high density linear charge-coupled optoelec- tronic detector array for capturing the spectral oscillation change induced by the SPR sensing unit; and the digitized carrier-frequency-modulated interferograms can be stored so\n\nan\n\nis\n\n10\n\n20\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nSimulation results for the phase responses of the optical\n\ning layer at each wavelength interval, which is the phase signal detected in each spectral element within the spectral\n\nUS 8,953,168 B2\n\n8\n\n7\n\nferential spectral interferometry.

The phase response curve from the SPR con- figuration is shown in FIG. 10, the refractive index sensing range is from 1.333RIU to 1.375RIU (ie. the dynamic range is approximately 4x10-? MU). The resolution gradually decreases from 3.57x10-\u00b0 RIU/degree to 8.41x10-\u00b0 RIU/de- gree as the refractive index moves further away from the optimized value. FIG. 11 shows the simulation results of the phase response in the wide dynamic range spectral phase- sensitive SPR sensor with the LRSPR sensing surface con- figuration. The curves from curve 1101 to curve 1115 repre- sent the spectral phase response of the sensing layer at each wavelength interval, specifically, the wavelengths of 660 nm, 665 nm, 670 nm, 674 nm, 679 nm, 684 nm, 689 nm, 694 nm, 699 nm, 704 nm, 709 nm, 714 nm, 718 nm, 723 nm, 728 nm and 733 nm, respectively. The phase response of the LRSPR configuration, as shown in FIG. 11, indicates that the resolu- tion only varies from 3.36x10-* RIU/degree to 7.73x10-* RIU/degree within the dynamic range of 4x10-? MU. Thus, the multi-wavelength spectral phase interrogating system is compatible with standard SPR and LRSPR configurations, resulting in tremendous expansion of the measurable\n\ndynamic range, the polychromatic light source may be colli- mated and directed to the SPR sensing surface at fixed angles and covers a broad range of wavelengths. To facilitate high resolution of measurement, a carrier frequency modulator in terms of an electronically controlled liquid crystal variable retarder is implemented into the common interferometric path. The exit beam, which is now selectively modulated by SPW together with a carrier frequency modulation, in fact contains SPR information enclosed by the spectral bandwidth of the polychromatic source. Consequently, ifan optical spec- trum analyzer (OSA) is configured to collect the light energy of the entire reflected spectrum, the signal from individual detector elements is equivalent to conducting SPR detection with numerous carrier frequency modulated monochromatic sources. By implementation of spectral interferometry, the signal traces collected by the OSA contain the necessary information for finding both the spectral SPR reflectivity dip as well as the spectral SPR phase of the polychromatic spec- trum simultaneously. This means it is possible to cover all the performance attributes of conventional spectral SPR systems, while at the same time further provides much improved reso- lution capability through carrier frequency modulated spec-\n\ncan increase the range of incident wavelengths so as to increase the dynamic range of phase-sensitive SPR biosen- sors. In addition, the introduction of LRSPR effect in the SPR sensing surface can sharpen the resonance peak so that the detection resolution of phase-sensitive SPR biosensors can be further enhanced. The SPR sensor of the present application provides the following advantages: It resolves the issue of limited dynamic range typically associated with monochro- matic laser based phase-sensitive SPR biosensors. It resolves the issue of limited detection sensitivity typically associated. with spectral intensity interrogating SPR biosensors. It over- comes the issue of spectral phase discontinuity associated\n\naccording to the present application has an advantage over the conventional monochromatic laser based phase-sensitive SPR scheme in terms of operational dynamic range of the refractive index measurement. It includes a broadband light source for providing a polychromatic light beam; a common- path spectral interferometer which provides simplified opti- cal configuration and reduced fabrication cost in comparison to previous Michelson approach. In addition, an electroni- cally controlled liquid crystal variable retarder can be pro- vided to introduce carrier frequency modulation without mechanical moving part. Also, an SPR sensing unit, which is based on either an SPR or an LRSPR sensing layer configu- ration, can be adopted for receiving a multi-wavelength light beam at fixed angles of incident and introducing a specific phase retardation change in each incident wavelength within the polychromatic beam, and a single channel spectral ana- lyzer unit can be provided for receiving the light emerging from spectral interferometer to provide a series of spectral oscillation for further processing to find the differential phase retardation introduced by the SPR sensor unit, which ulti- mately leads to the determination of the refractive index shift caused by the binding of biomolecules to the sensing surface. A processing unit can be provided for analyzing the interfero- metric signal traces generated from the recombination of the reference and signal polarized beams that finally the mea- sured refractive index shift in the sensor surface. The intro- duction of a polychromatic light source in spectral phase- sensitive SPR sensor system drastically increases the detection dynamic range of the system. This also permits the incorporation of LRSPR sensor layer design, which is known to offer very high phase detection resolution because of its narrow resonance peak, so that the limited operational range can be compensated by the multi-wavelength approach. The resultant system therefore offers high measurement resolu- tion and wide dynamic range in a robust optical configuration,\n\nTherefore, the spectral interferometric SPR biosensor with common-path scheme is possible to offer a robust optical configuration with reduces number of elements, i.e. elimi- nates the dummy SPR prism, thus reduces the manufacturing cost, while retaining the phase detection sensitivity.\n\nAccording to another aspect of the present application, a method for detecting characteristics of a target sample is provided as shown in FIG. 12.
