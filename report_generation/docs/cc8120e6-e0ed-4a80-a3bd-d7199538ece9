Problematically, as the terahertz frequency band usually lies beyond the maximum oscillation frequency in silicon, these existing devices may suffer from heating and/or efficiency problems.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0005] In a first aspect, there is provided a radiator for terahertz electromagnetic radiation. The radiator comprises one or more radiator units. Each of the one or more radiator units respectively comprises: an oscillator arrangement operable to generate third harmonic power, and a patch antenna arrangement operably coupled with the oscillator arrangement for radiating terahertz electromagnetic radia- tion based on the generated third harmonic power.\n\n[0006] The terahertz electromagnetic radiation provided by the radiator may be in the range from about 0.1 THz to about 10 THz. In some embodiments, the terahertz electro- magnetic radiation is from about 0.2 THz to about 5 THz. In some embodiments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.3 THz to about 3 THz. In some embodi- ments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.3 THz to about 1 THz.

The first transistor and the second transistor are operably coupled to operate in phase.\n\n[0013] The first transistor and the second transistor may each respectively be a solid-state electronic device such as a silicon-based solid-state electronic device. For example, the first transistor and the second transistor may each be a field effect transistor (FET). The first transistor and the second transistor may each respectively be arranged (e.g., controlled) to selectively operate in an active region, a cut-off region, and a triode region for facilitating generation of the third harmonic power.\n\n[0014] Insome embodiments, the gate terminal of the first transistor and the gate terminal of the second transistor are electrically connected with each other.\n\n[0015] In some embodiments, the source terminal of the first transistor and the source terminal of the second tran- sistor are electrically connected with each other.\n\n[0016] Insome embodiments, the gate terminal of the first transistor and the gate terminal of the second transistor are electrically connected with the even-mode-shorted coupler.\n\n[0017] In some embodiments, each of the first oscillator and the second oscillator respectively further comprises: a first circuit arrangement electrically connected with the source terminal of the first transistor, a second circuit arrangement electrically connected with the source terminal of the second transistor, a third circuit arrangement electri- cally connected with the drain terminal of the first transistor and operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement (e.g., with the first patch element), and a fourth circuit arrangement electrically connected with the drain terminal of the second transistor and operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement (e.g., with the second patch element). In other words, the first oscillator has its own first to fourth circuit arrangements and the second oscillator has its own first to fourth circuit arrangements.\n\n[0018] In some embodiments, the first circuit arrangement comprises a capacitive arrangement for facilitating oscilla- tion and a transmission line arrangement for power supply.\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nThe capacitive arrangement and the transmission line arrangement of the first circuit arrangement are arranged electrically in parallel.

In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the second circuit arrangement is grounded. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the second circuit arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a curved transmission line. In some examples, the curved transmission line is a wavy transmission line with multiple bends.\n\n[0020]\n\nIn\n\nsome embodiments, the third circuit arrange-\n\nment comprises: a transmission line arrangement operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement and an AC short termination arrangement electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement. In some examples, the AC short termination arrangement of the third circuit arrange- ment comprises a grounded capacitive arrangement electri- cally connected in series with the transmission line arrange- ment. In some examples, the grounded capacitive arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a grounded capacitor. In some examples, the transmission line arrange- ment of the third circuit arrangement comprises, or consists only of: a first transmission line portion with an end elec- trically connected in series with the AC short termination arrangement, and a second transmission line portion extend- ing from the first transmission line portion and electrically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. A DC supply voltage may be applied between the first transmission line portion and the AC short termination arrangement. In some examples, the first transmission line portion is straight. In some examples, the second transmission line portion is straight. In some examples, the first and second transmission\n\nline portions are generally perpendicular.\n\n[0021] In some embodiments, the fourth circuit arrange- ment comprises: a transmission line arrangement operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement and an AC short termination arrangement electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement. In some examples, the AC short termination arrangement of the fourth circuit arrange- ment comprises a grounded capacitive arrangement electri- cally connected in series with the transmission line arrange- ment. In some examples, the grounded capacitive arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a grounded capacitor. In some examples, the transmission line arrange- ment of the fourth circuit arrangement comprises, or consists\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nonly of: a first transmission line portion with an end elec- trically connected in series with the AC short termination arrangement, and a second transmission line portion extend- ing from the first transmission line portion and electrically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. A DC supply voltage may be applied between the first transmission line portion and the AC short termination arrangement. In some examples, the first transmission line portion is straight. In some examples, the second transmission line portion is straight. In some examples, the first and second transmission line portions are generally perpendicular.\n\n[0022] In some embodiments, the transmission line arrangement of the first circuit arrangement and the trans- mission line arrangement of the second circuit arrangement are generally symmetrically disposed about an axis of reflec- tion symmetry. The axis of reflection symmetry may be parallel to or collinear with a long axis of the transmission line of the even-mode-shorted coupler.\n\n[0023] In some embodiments, the transmission line arrangement of the third circuit arrangement and the trans- mission line arrangement of the fourth circuit arrangement are generally symmetrically disposed about an axis of reflec- tion symmetry. The axis of reflection symmetry may be parallel to or collinear with a long axis of the transmission line of the even-mode-shorted coupler.\n\n[0024] In some embodiments, the patch antenna arrange- ment comprises an on-chip patch antenna arrangement.\n\n[0025] In some embodiments, the first patch element electrically coupled (e.g., capacitively coupled) with the third circuit arrangement of the first oscillator and the third circuit arrangement of the second oscillator.\n\n[0026] In some embodiments, the second patch element electrically coupled (e.g., capacitively coupled) with the fourth circuit arrangement of the first oscillator and the fourth circuit arrangement of the second oscillator.\n\n[0027] Insome embodiments, the first transistor of the first oscillator and the first transistor of the second oscillator are arranged to selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the first patch element. For example, in one cycle, the first transistor of the first oscillator may provide third harmonic power to the first patch element for about half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously), and the first tran- sistor of the second oscillator may provide third harmonic power to the first patch element for about another half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously).\n\n[0028] In some embodiments, the second transistor of the first oscillator and the second transistor of the second oscillator are arranged to selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the second patch element. For example, in one cycle, the second transistor of the first oscillator may provide third harmonic power to the second patch element for about half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously), and the second transistor of the second oscil- lator may provide third harmonic power to the second patch element for about another half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously).\n\n[0029] In some embodiments, the first patch element belongs to a portion (e.g., half) of a larger patch.\n\n[0030] In some embodiments, the second patch element belongs to a portion (e.g., half) of a larger patch.\n\nis\n\nis\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nIn\n\nin\n\nthe transmis-\n\n[0031] some embodiments, plan view, sion line of the even-mode-shorted coupler is disposed between the first patch element and the second patch ele- ment.\n\n[0032] In some embodiments, in plan view, the first patch element and the second patch element are generally sym- metrically disposed about an axis of reflection symmetry. The axis of reflection symmetry may be parallel to or collinear with a long axis of the transmission line of the even-mode-shorted coupler.\n\n[0033] In some embodiments, in plan view, the first oscil- lator and the second oscillator are generally symmetrically disposed about an axis of reflection symmetry.

In some embodi- ments, the array (of multiple radiator units) can be divided into multiple subarrays each having multiple rows, and each subarray may be subjected to a respective bias voltage, which can be controlled to affect one or more properties (e.g., radiation pattern, direction, etc.) of the terahertz elec- tromagnetic radiation provided by the radiator 2700.\n\n[0122] In the radiator 2700 of FIG. 27, the radiator units 2700-1, 2700-2 are arranged in the same row whereas radiator units 2700-1, 2700-3 are arranged in adjacent rows.\n\nthe\n\n[0123]\n\nThe radiator units 2700-1, 2700-2 in the same row\n\nmay be operably (e.g., electrically) coupled via a coupling arrangement. In some embodiments, the coupling arrange- ment includes an even-mode-shorted coupler for enabling or sustaining an out-of-phase coupling mode between one oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-1 of the radia- tor unit 2700-1 and an adjacent oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-2 of the radiator unit 2700-2. In some embodiments, the even-mode-shorted coupler of the cou- pling arrangement may include a transmission line arrange- ment electrically connected between one oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-1 of the radiator unit 2700-1 and the adjacent oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-2 of the radiator unit 2700-2, and a capacitive arrange- ment electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement and operable to facilitate shorting of an even-\n\nmode impedance. [0124] The radiator units 2700-1, 2700-3 in adjacent rows\n\nmay be operably (e.g., electrically) coupled via a coupling arrangement. In some embodiments, the coupling arrange- ment includes two couplers, one electrically connected. between one oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and one oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2, and another electrically connected between another oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and another oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2. The two couplers may be odd-mode-shorted couplers each for enabling or sustaining an in-phase coupling mode between the respective two oscillators it electrically con- nects with. In some embodiments, the odd-mode-shorted couplers may each respectively include: a transmission line arrangement electrically connected between the correspond- ing oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and the correspond- ing oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2, one capacitive arrangement electrically connected between the transmis- sion line arrangement and the corresponding oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and operable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode impedance, and one capacitive arrangement elec- trically connected between the transmission line arrange- ment and the oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2 and\n\noperable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode impedance. be\n\n[0125] In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 can fabricated using CMOS technologies, such as 65 nm CMOS process/technology. In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 can be arranged in, or formed in, an integrated circuit (chip). In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 is a terahertz,\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nradiator configured for terahertz electromagnetic radiation only. In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 is configured for terahertz electromagnetic radiation as well as for elec- tromagnetic radiation at one or more other frequency frequencies.\n\n[0126] The following disclosure provides further example embodiments of a radiator for terahertz electromagnetic radiation and a radiator unit for terahertz electromagnetic radiation of the invention. These example embodiments can be considered as more specific implementations of the designs associated with FIGS. 25 to 27.\n\n[0127] In some embodiments, there is provided a patch- antenna-based 2D array, e.g., oscillator array or coupled oscillator array. In some embodiments, the patch-antenna- based 2D array includes a synchronization network with an operation mode that can support differential excitation of the patch antenna arrangement of the patch-antenna-based 2D array, for improved area efficiency. In some embodiments, there is provided a coupled oscillator array for high coherent radiation power and lensless effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). In some embodiments, there is provided a high-efficiency and beam-steerable coupled oscillator-radia- tor array, integrated with a patch antenna arrangement for front-side radiation.\n\n[0128] In some embodiments, there is provided a 2D synchronization network for an oscillator-and-patch-an- tenna-based radiator. The oscillator-and-patch-antenna- based radiator may include multiple oscillators (e.g., -gm cells) arranged in a 2D array, i.e., in multiple rows each with multiple oscillators and multiple columns each with multiple oscillators, and the 2D synchronization network may be arranged to couple the oscillators. The oscillator-and-patch- antenna-based radiator may also include a patch antenna arrangement operably coupled with the oscillators. The patch antenna arrangement may include patch antennas each differentially fed by two adjacent coupled oscillators. In some embodiments, the 2D synchronization network can sustain an out-of-phase coupling mode for adjacent coupled oscillators and an in-phase coupling mode for adjacent coupled oscillators in the same column for different col-\n\numns.\n\n[0129] In this embodiment, the 2D synchronization net- work that sustains an out-of-phase coupling mode for adja- cent oscillators (e.g., gm cells) in each row and an in-phase coupling mode for adjacent oscillators (e.g., \u4e00 gm cells) in each column (and different rows). In combination with the differentially-fed patch antenna (which can operate as power combiner), the out-of-phase coupling mode enables con- structive power combining for the oscillators (e.g., \u4e00 em cells) in each row. The in-phase coupling mode between rows enables power combining across the array.\n\n[0130] To better understand the design, a two-element oscillator is analyzed below to determine the condition both coupling modes.\n\nrealizing\n\n[0131] FIG. 1A shows a general two-element oscillator model in one example. In FIG. 1A, Z, and Z represent the equivalent input impedance of the two coupled cores. It is noted that the real parts of Zs or Zr are negative so that they can replenish the energy loss in the two-port coupler between Z, and Z,.\n\n[0132] In this example, the two-port coupler is modeled using Z parameters. For a passive, symmetric two-port network (Z),=Z>>, Z2=Z>,), the voltages and currents rela- tionship can be represented as follows:\n\nor\n\nfor\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n[j= Ar alba a yy Zr Ziib\n\n[0133] For the two cores, the voltages and currents are represented as follows:\n\nleo alte) \u00b0\n\n[0134] If the two cores collectively oscillate, the Kirch- hoffs Current Low (KCL) should be satisfied as follows:\n\n[ele] \u4eba\n\n[0135] Based on the above equations, the voltage relation- ship between the two ports can be represented as follows:\n\nMy Zi Zip + ZuZy, (4 ian 2221,\n\n[0136] The relationship between Zs and Zr can also deduced as\n\nbe\n\nBh tts \u00a9 Z= Z + \u5973\n\n[0137] From another perspective, the Z parameters can be rewritten using even and odd mode impedances for a sym- metric two-port network. FIG. 1B shows the related even and odd mode equivalent circuits based on T-network equivalent circuit of a two-port network. Accordingly, it can be deduced that:\n\nZe+Zo (6) = 2\n\nLZ.-Z, 7 t= 2% 0\n\n[0138] Further, equations (4) and (5) can be rewritten using even and odd mode impedances as follows:\n\nVi Zot Zo\\Zr + 2ZZo (3) \u4e94 (Ze- 2.21,\n\n2 ~ (Zot Lohr @) 8 Ze + Zo +2Z,\n\n[0139] By shorting the even-mode impedance (Z,=0), the voltage relationship of equation (8) equals -1 regardless of Z,. This corresponds to the out-of-phase coupling mode. Assuming the two cores are identical, the impedance rela- tionship in equation (9) is reduced to Z,=Z,=\u2014-Z 9. This condition can be used to determine the oscillation frequency and oscillation amplitude. Similarly, by shorting the odd- mode impedance (Z,=0), V,/V.=1. This corresponds to the\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nin-phase coupling mode. Assuming the two cores are iden- tical, the impedance relationship in equation (9) is reduced Z=Z,=-Z,.\n\nto\n\nBased on the above findings, a 2D scalable coupled oscillator array with desired operation mode can be formed.\n\n[0140]\n\n[0141] FIG. 2 shows a 2D scalable coupled oscillator array topology for a radiator for terahertz electromagnetic radia- tion in some embodiments of the invention. In FIG. 2, in each row, an even-mode-shorted coupler (\u201cout-of-phase coupler\u201d) can be used to sustain the out-of-phase coupling mode between the two adjacent negative gm (-gm) cells. The even-mode-shorted coupler may include a transmission line arrangement electrically connected between the two adjacent -gm cells in the same row, and a capacitive arrangement electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement and operable to facilitate shorting of even- mode impedance. In this embodiment, the even-mode- shorted coupler includes a coupling transmission line elec- trically connecting two adjacent -gm cells, and a capacitor C, loaded at the center of the coupling transmission line for shorting the even-mode impedance. In each column, an odd-mode-shorted coupler (\u201cin-phase coupler\u201d) can be used to sustain the in-phase coupling mode between the two adjacent -gm cells in the same column (and in adjacent rows). The odd-mode-shorted coupler may include a trans- mission line arrangement electrically connected between the two adjacent -gm cells in the same column (and in adjacent rows), a first capacitive arrangement electrically connected between the transmission line arrangement and one of the two adjacent -gm cells and operable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode impedance, and a second capacitive arrange- ment electrically connected between the transmission line arrangement and another one of the two adjacent -gm cells and operable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode imped- ance. In this embodiment, the odd-mode-shorted coupler includes a coupling transmission line electrically connecting two adjacent -gm cells in the same column (and in adjacent rows), one capacitor Ci connected between one of the -gm cells and the coupling transmission line, and another capaci- tor Ci connected between the other one of the -gm cells and the coupling transmission line. In some embodiments, the length of the coupling transmission line is determined, then the capacitance of C, can be tuned to short the odd-mode impedance. The odd-mode impedance of the out-of-phase couplers, the even-mode impedance of the in-phase cou- plers, and the input impedance of -gm cells should satisfy\n\nthe deduced impedance condition for sustaining oscillation, which can be determined based on the equivalent analysis presented below.\n\n[0142] FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate a 12x12 coupled oscil- lator array 300 (as a radiator for terahertz electromagnetic radiation) in one embodiment of the invention, designed based on the 2D scalable coupled oscillator array topology illustrated in FIG. 2. A part 300P of the array 300 is shown enlarged in FIG. 3B. The 12x12 coupled oscillator array 300 includes 144 oscillators operably coupled with each other via even-mode-shorted couplers 320 and odd-mode-shorted. couplers 310 (for simplicity, only one for each is labeled in FIG. 3B) as described with reference of FIG. 2.\n\n[0143] In this embodiment, the oscillators (-gm cells) of the array 300 are arranged to collectively oscillate at the fundamental oscillation frequency (fo) of 225 GHz and to radiate the third harmonic (3fo) using the corresponding differentially-fed patch antennas of a patch antenna arrange-\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nment (the patches of the patch antennas are not specifically illustrated). In this embodiment, the operation mode of the third harmonic 3f, is the same as the fundamental frequency fo: and horizontally adjacent oscillators can provide out-of- phase excitation at 3f, to the corresponding patch antenna. Accordingly, the patch antenna can serve as a power com- biner to improve area efficiency.\n\n300 is divided into\n\nIn this embodiment, the\n\n[0144]\n\narray four subarrays, each with 3 rows of 12 out-of-phase coupled oscillators (-gm cells). Each subarray is subjected to a respective bias voltage. By adjusting the bias voltages to the different subarrays, potential device mismatch in different subarrays can be compensated for broadside radiation. Also, yy tuning the bias voltages, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation (e.g., beam) radiated by the array may be steered. in some embodiments, as the free-running frequency of the peripheral oscillators (-gm cells) may substantially influ- ence the steady-state phase relationship, the radiation direc- tion in the H-plane can be controlled by tuning the bias\n\nvoltage Vg, and/or Vg.\n\n[0145] FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate a 1x2 unit cell 400 in the 12x12 coupled oscillator array 300 in FIG. 3A in one embodiment of the invention. The 1x2 unit cell may be considered as a radiator unit whereas the 12x12 coupled oscillator array (with multiple 1x2 unit cells) may be con- sidered as a radiator (with multiple radiator units).\n\n[0146] The unit cell 400 generally includes an oscillator arrangement operable to generate third harmonic power, and a patch antenna arrangement operably coupled with the oscillator arrangement for radiating terahertz electromag- netic radiation based on the generated third harmonic power.\n\n[0147] In this embodiment, the unit cell 400 includes two oscillators each operable to generate third harmonic power. Each of the two oscillators respectively comprises a tran- sistor arrangement 402A, 402B. The construction of the two oscillators are generally the same so for simplicity the following only describes the construction of the oscillator with the transistor arrangement 402A in greater detail.\n\n[0148] In this embodiment, the transistor arrangement 402A includes two transistors (e.g., FETs), which are oper- ably coupled to operate in phase, and each including respec- tive drain, source, and gate terminals. The transistors may each respectively be arranged (e.g., controlled) to selectively operate in and transit between/among an active region, a cut-off region, and a triode region for facilitating generation of the third harmonic power.\n\n[0149] In this embodiment, the gate terminals of the transistors are electrically connected with each other directly, and the source terminals of the two transistors electrically connected with each other directly.\n\ntwo\n\nare\n\n[0150] In this embodiment, the two transistors of transistor arrangement 402A are further connected with various circuit arrangements.\n\nthe\n\n[0151] First, the source terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) is electrically connected with a capacitive arrangement for facilitating oscillation and a transmission line arrangement for power supply. The transmission line arrangement is arranged electrically in parallel with the capacitive arrangement. In this embodi- ment, the capacitive arrangement includes a grounded capacitor and the transmission line arrangement includes a curved (wavy) transmission line with multiple turns via\n\ngrounded\n\na capacitor.\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\n[0152] Second, the source terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) is electrically connected with a capacitive arrangement for facilitating oscillation and a transmission line arrangement for power supply. The transmission line arrangement is arranged elec- trically in parallel with the capacitive arrangement. In this embodiment, the capacitive arrangement includes a grounded capacitor and the transmission line arrangement includes a curved (wavy) transmission line with multiple turns grounded via a capacitor.\n\n[0153] In this embodiment, the capacitive arrangement and the transmission line arrangement connected to the source terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) are generally the same as the capacitive arrange- ment and the transmission line arrangement connected to the source terminal of the other one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A).\n\n[0154] Third, the drain terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) is electrically connected with a transmission line arrangement operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement and an AC short termination arrangement electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement. In this embodiment, the AC short termi- nation arrangement includes a grounded capacitor electri- cally connected in series with the transmission line arrange- ment. In this embodiment, the transmission line arrangement includes two straight transmission line portions arranged generally perpendicularly, a first one with an end electrically connected in series with the AC short termination arrange- ment, and a second one extending from the first and elec- trically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. A DC supply voltage may be applied at a node between the first transmission line portion and the AC short termination arrangement.\n\n[0155] Fourth, the drain terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) is electrically connected with a transmission line arrangement operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement and an AC short termination arrangement electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement. In this embodiment, the AC short termination arrangement includes a grounded capaci- tor electrically connected in series with the transmission line arrangement. In this embodiment, the transmission line arrangement includes two straight transmission line portions arranged generally perpendicularly, a first one with an end electrically connected in series with the AC short termina- tion arrangement, and a second one extending from the first and electrically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. A DC supply voltage may be applied at a node between the first transmission line portion and the AC short termination arrangement.\n\n[0156] In this embodiment, the transmission line arrange- ment and the AC short termination arrangement connected to the drain terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) are generally the same as the transmission line arrangement and the AC short termination arrangement connected to the drain terminal of the other one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A).\n\n[0157] Like the two transistors of the transistor arrange- ment 402A, the two transistors of the transistor arrangement 402B are also connected with various circuit arrangements. These various circuit arrangements of the two transistors\n\nof\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nthe\n\ntransistor arrangement 402B are generally the same those various circuit arrangements of the two transistors transistor arrangement 402A. Thu, for simplicity, they not be described in detail.\n\nthe will\n\nas\n\nof\n\n[0158] The unit cell 400 also includes a coupler 402C electrically coupling the two oscillators. In this embodiment, the coupler 402C is an even-mode-shorted coupler (such as that described with reference to FIG. 2) for enabling or sustaining an out-of-phase coupling mode between the two oscillators. The gate terminals of the transistors of both transistor arrangements 402A, 402B of the two oscillators are all electrically connected with the even-mode-shorted coupler (and other even-mode-shorted coupler(s) connected with adjacent unit cell(s), if any).\n\n[0159] In this embodiment, the source terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) may be electrically connected with an odd-mode-shorted coupler (such as that described with reference to FIG. 2) for enabling or sustaining an in-phase coupling mode between itself and an adjacent oscillator in an adjacent unit cell, and/or the source terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) may be electrically connected with an odd-mode-shorted coupler (such as that described with reference to FIG. 2) for enabling or sustaining an in-phase coupling mode between itself and an adjacent oscillator in an adjacent unit cell.\n\n[0160] Inthis embodiment, the patch antenna arrangement of the unit cell 400 includes two patch elements 404A, 404B with generally identical shape and size and construction (but arranged at different positions). Each of the patch elements 404A, 404B is respectively coupled with both oscillators. Each of the patch elements 404A, 404B may respectively be part of a larger patch (e.g., combined with the patch elements of adjacent unit cells, e.g., see FIG. 15).\n\n[0161] In this embodiment, the patch element 404A is electrically, in particularly capacitively, coupled with the transmission line connected to the drain terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) of the transistor arrangement 402A and with the transmission line connected to the drain terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) of the transistor arrangement 402B. The patch element 404A may be differentially fed, ie., the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B may selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the patch element 404A.\n\n[0162] In this embodiment, the patch element 404B is electrically, in particularly capacitively, coupled with the transmission line connected to the drain terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) of the transistor arrangement 402A and with the transmission line connected to the drain terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) of the transistor arrangement 402B. The patch element 404B may be differ- entially fed, ie., the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B may selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the patch element 404B.\n\n[0163] As shown in FIG. 4A, in this embodiment, in plan view, the long axis of the transmission line of the coupler 402C (Le., a horizontal axis in FIG. 4A) may be an axis of reflection symmetry for the transmission line arrangements connected to the drain and/or source terminals of one of the transistors and the transmission line arrangements connected to the drain and/or source terminals of another one of the transistors in the same transistor arrangement. In this\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nembodiment, in plan view, the transmission line of the coupler 402C is disposed between the two patch elements 404A, 404B, with the long axis of the transmission line of the coupler 402C being an axis of reflection symmetry for the two patch elements 404A, 404B. In this embodiment, in plan view, the two oscillators are generally symmetrically disposed about an axis of reflection symmetry, which cor- responds to an axis that bisects each of the two patch elements 404A, 404B (ie., a vertical axis in FIG. 4A).\n\n[0164]\n\nIn\n\nthe\n\nembodiment,\n\nterminals\n\nof\n\ngate\n\none\n\ntransistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are connected to the horizontal coupling network (of even- mode-shorted couplers, intra unit cell or inter unit cells) for out-of-phase oscillation/coupling mode. In one embodiment, the source terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are connected to the vertical coupling network (of odd-mode-shorted couplers, inter unit cells) for in-phase oscillation/coupling mode. In one embodiment, the source terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are separately con- nected to respective parallel capacitor for optimum oscilla- tion state and respective curved transmission line for DC supply. In one embodiment, the drain terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are separately respectively connected to transmission line with AC short termination. In one embodiment, the DC supply voltage Vp for the drain terminal is fed from the AC short termination. In one embodiment, the capacitively-fed patch antenna arrangement, in particular patch elements 404A, 404B, is operably coupled with the drain terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A,\n\n402B for selectively radiating the third harmonic power.\n\nof\n\n[0165] FIG. 4B shows illustrate some example dimensions the unit cell 400 in one embodiment.\n\n[0166] In this embodiment, as the transistor pair of each respective transistor arrangements 402A, 402B is connected at the same gate node and source node, the transistor pair o the transistor arrangement 402A operate in phase and the transistor pair of the transistor arrangement 402B operate in phase.\n\n[0167] FIG. 5 shows an equivalent AC lumped circuit at fo ofa one-quarter circuit of the unit cell 400 in FIG. 4A (based on the operation mode). The equivalent AC lumped circuit in this example has a T-embedding-based oscillator topol- ogy. In this example, the coupling network can be consid- ered as part of the oscillator. In FIG. 5, the gate inductor is separated for out-of-phase strong coupling horizontally and the source capacitor is separated for weak coupling verti- cally.\n\n[0168] In some embodiments, to improve the conversion efficiency, the harmonic oscillator is purposely designed to optimize the third harmonic output power. Inventors of the present invention have realized that high-efficiency terahertz harmonic oscillator design generally includes three aspects: 1) determination of the transistor operation state to maxi- mize the desired harmonic output current; 2) oscillator synthesis satisfying the obtained condition; and 3) proper matching at the desired harmonic.\n\n[0169] In the following, the nonlinear operation of a transistor is studied to optimize third harmonic generation. By understanding the third harmonic current generation mechanism in a transistor, the operation conditions for a transistor to increase the third harmonic output can be determined.\n\nthe\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n11\n\n[0170] FIG. 6 shows an example simulation setup studying nonlinear behavior of a transistor. In this example, simulation frequency is set to be 1 GHz so that parasitic effect is sufficiently small.\n\nthe\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\n[0171] Compared to the nonlinearity of transconductance, the operation region transition of the transistor can output a much larger harmonic current at the transistor drain. Inven- tors of the present invention have devised that one of the sources of harmonic current comes from the transition between active and cut-off regions and another one of the sources of harmonic current comes from the transition between active and triode regions, and both transitions can alter the drain current waveform. Within one period, the time distribution difference between the active, cut-off, and triode regions may correspond to various operation states, which lead to variation of harmonic currents. The following dis- closure focuses on the second and third harmonics because the other higher harmonics are much weaker.\n\n[0172] The DC bias voltage and AC fundamental voltage at the transistor gate mainly determine the duration of the cut-off region. The DC supply voltage and AC fundamental signal at the transistor drain mainly determine the duration of the triode region.\n\n[0173] FIG. 7A shows the simulated drain current wave- form under the given DC bias and fundamental driving voltages as well as the gate and drain voltage waveforms. The fundamental waveforms at the gate and drain are out of phase so that the transistor can output fundamental power. Based on the setting in FIG. 7A, the transistor is already driven into the cut-off region. Then, the fundamental AC voltage IV, fol at the drain is changed to study its effect on the harmonic current output. FIG. 7B shows the correspond- ing results. Specifically, FIG. 7B shows simulated harmonic currents at the drain terminal of the transistor under different fundamental voltages at the drain terminal of the transistor, and three corresponding current waveforms at selected fun- damental voltage IV, fol.\n\n[0174] As shown by the simulated current waveforms in FIG. 7B, the fundamental current output decreases as the IV,_f5| increases because the transistor enters the triode region. The second harmonic current first decreases to near zero and then rises under high |Vz_fjl. The generated second harmonic current from the active and cut-off transition is out of phase with the second harmonic current from the active and triode regions transition. Therefore, the second har- monic current output is reduced to a small or minimal value. When the transistor is driven into the deep triode region, the second harmonic current continues to increase. In this example, it can be found that the third harmonic current always increases with |V,_f,|, because both transitions can contribute to third harmonic current generation.\n\n[0175] The large harmonic current at the transistor drain can induce harmonic voltage if a resistive harmonic load is terminated for harmonic power extraction. The induced harmonic voltage can change the depth of the triode region. Therefore, the harmonic voltage at the drain can also change the harmonic current output. In one example, to study the effect of second and third harmonic voltages on the output current, the second and third harmonic voltages are respec- tively applied at the transistor drain with the correct phase, to ensure the transistor output second and third harmonic power to a resistive load. FIG. 8A shows simulated drain current waveforms (obtained by varying the second har- monic voltage IV, _2f)!) and corresponding gate and drain\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nvoltage waveforms obtained from the transistor. FIG. 9A shows simulated drain current waveforms (obtained by varying the third harmonic voltage |V 3fol) and corre- sponding gate and drain voltage waveforms obtained from the transistor.\n\n[0176]\n\nFIG. 8B shows simulated harmonic currents at the\n\ndrain terminal of the transistor under different second har- monic drain voltages IV 2fol at the drain terminal of the transistor. In FIG. 8B, the harmonic current output is plotted against different second harmonic voltage amplitudes IV ,_ 2fol. It is found that the fundamental current increases as IV; 2f | increases. This can be understood from FIG. 8A. The current waveform recovers from the dip as IV, 2fol increases because the transistor leaves the deep triode region. As the duration of the triode region decreases, the third harmonic current decreases, as shown in FIG. 8B. As for the second harmonic current, it first decreases to a small or minimal value and then increases with |V 2f,]. This behavior can be understood because the transistor is already in the cut-off region. The second harmonic current cancel- ation from active-triode transition is reduced once the triode duration is decreased. FIG. 9B shows simulated harmonic currents at the drain terminal of the transistor under different third harmonic drain voltages |V,_3f| at the drain terminal of the transistor. The harmonic current behaviors shown in FIG. 9B are similar by increasing the amplitude of IV, 3fol because it also reduces the triode region duration and\n\nrecover the current waveform, as shown in FIG. 9A.\n\n[0177] Based on the above, the harmonic positive feed- back phenomenon in a second harmonic oscillator for boost- ing harmonic output can be appreciated and such phenom- enon is also valid for third harmonic oscillator. By providing the transistor drain a resistive load at 3fo, the induced third harmonic voltage Vz 3fo can improve the II, fol as shown in FIG. 9B, which can boost the fundamental oscillator amplitude. The improved |V_,_f5| can then increase II, 31, as shown in FIG. 7B, leading to a positive feedback loop for boosting the third harmonic output power. The loop can finally remain stable under a high |V, 3fol because II, 3f, decreases as IV, 3fol increases, as shown in FIG. 9B.\n\n[0178] In addition, from FIG. 8B, it is found that if the second harmonic voltage is induced with the proper phase at the drain, the third harmonic current will be decreased and lead to the third harmonic output power drop. To relieve this effect, the second harmonic current generation can be reduced by simultaneously driving the transistor into cut-o. and triode transition, as shown in FIG. 7B. Shorting the second harmonic or providing reactive loading at 2fo to shift the phase of induced voltage can also relieve 3fo current reduction.\n\n[0179] In summary, large fundamental driving voltages at the transistor gate and drain can improve the third harmonic current generation. Proper resistive loading of the transistor drain at the third harmonic is useful to boost the third harmonic output and extract the harmonic power. Moreover, minimizing second harmonic current can avoid third har- monic current output reduction.\n\n[0180] In the above, the nonlinear operation of a transistor at low frequency is studied and methods for improving the third harmonic current generation is presented. The follow- ing now describes the design of the oscillator at a high fundamental frequency of 225 GHz, considering the para- sitic capacitance of transistor.\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n[0181] As mentioned above, both high fundamental ampli- tude harmonic at the transistor gate by driving the transistor into the cut-off region and high fundamental amplitude at the transistor drain by driving the transistor into the triode region can simultaneously boost third harmonic current output. A higher net fundamental output power of the transistor can sustain a stronger oscillation fundamental amplitude in an oscillator. In some examples, the phase difference of fundamental voltage gain between the gate and drain deviates from 180\u00b0 to compensate for the direct current feedthrough to improve the fundamental oscillation ampli- tude at a high fundamental oscillation frequency.\n\n[0182] FIG. 10 shows an example simulation setup for determining fundamental operation condition and harmonic load impedance (fundamental frequency set to 225 GHz). Specifically, the simulation setup in FIG. 10 can be used to determine the optimum fundamental voltage gain phase difference and corresponding net fundamental output power Po_fo.\n\n[0183] FIG. 11A shows simulated net fundamental output power Po_f, for different fundamental voltage gain phase differences \u00bb. As shown in FIG. 11A, in this example, phase difference of about 160\u00b0 can maximize Po_f, for higher fundamental oscillation amplitude.\n\na\n\na\n\n[0184] In one example, driving the transistor into and triode region can cancel the second harmonic current, relieving the potential adverse effect of the second harmonic voltage induced at the drain yet without shortening simplifying circuit design.\n\ncut-off\n\nit,\n\n[0185] In one example, the gate bias voltage Yo is chosen as 0.9 V, and the fundamental voltage Vg_f, applied to the gate is 1.2 V, which drives the transistor into the cut-off region. Then, the supply voltage V,, is chosen to be 1.4 V, and the fundamental voltage is swept at the drain (V_f) using the example simulation setup in FIG. 10.\n\nThe generated second and third harmonic currents\n\n[0186]\n\nand the net fundamental output power from the transistor are shown in FIG. 11B. Specifically, FIG. 11B shows simulated generated second and third harmonic currents and net fun- damental output power from the transistor for different fundamental voltages |V,_f)| at the drain terminal of the transistor. It is found that, in this example, by making V_{,=1.0 V, the transistor can also be driven into the triode region to cancel] the second harmonic current close to the minimal value. Coincidently, the Po_f, is near the peak under V_f)=1.0 V. Based on the determined fundamental driving voltages, the corresponding currents can be obtained using the same simulation setup. Given an oscillator topol- ogy, the corresponding component values can be explicitly synthesized based on the obtained voltages and currents. The T-embedding network-based oscillator topology can be used for terahertz harmonic oscillator design. In one example, the calculated component values are labeled on the equivalent\n\nAC lumped circuit, as shown in FIG. 5.\n\n[0187] At low frequency, providing the transistor drain with a proper resistive load at 3fo can extract third harmonic power from the transistor. As explained, this also induces a harmonic voltage with the correct phase, which can boost the output power due to harmonic positive feedback phe- nomenon of a harmonic oscillator. At THz frequency/fre- quencies, the optimum drain-source impedance at 3fo should be reactive to resonate with the parasitic capacitance of the transistor to provide a resistive load. Thus, good impedance matching at 3f, is particular useful, as it can effectively\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nextract the harmonic power as well as boost the output. In one example, the optimum impedance can be determined using the setup in FIG. 10 by performing a harmonic load pull simulation. Under the determined bias and fundamental voltages, the third harmonic drain-source impedance Zz 3f, is swept. The corresponding output power is shown in FIG. 12, which shows third harmonic output power Po_3f, from the transistor under different third harmonic drain- source impedance Z,,,_3f, at 3fo. In this example, the opti- mum Z,, 3f, is about 8+j179 for peak third harmonic output power Po_3f,. Other harmonic impedances shown in FIG. 10 are set to zero for initial optimum Z, 3f, determi- nation and are finally set based on the actual values of the implemented design.\n\n[0188] In relation to topology preference for 3fo extrac- tion, in some embodiments, the synthesized T-embedding network oscillator topology is used as it naturally separates the gate and drain bias voltages, which can be easily tuned for optimum fundamental oscillation condition to boost the third harmonic output. Moreover, this topology is suitable for high-efficiency third harmonic extraction. In some embodiments of the topology, there is no explicit path to guide the third harmonic current to the lossy gate, as shown in FIG. 5, thus can reduce the harmonic current feedback loss in a simple way.\n\n[0189] In some examples, however, an implicit third har- monic current feedback to the gate through the parasitic gate-drain or gate-source capacitor may still exist.\n\n[0190] FIG. 13 shows an equivalent AC lumped circuit at 3fo of a one-quarter circuit in the 1x2 unit cell in FIG. 4B. As shown in FIG. 13, the third harmonic current generated within the transistor is modeled as a current source. If the impedance of the source termination at 3f, is small, the 3f, current can directly flow to the ground rather than going back to the gate lossy resistor R, through C,,. On the other hand, if the impedance of the gate termination at 3fo is large enough, the 3f, current flowing to R, through C,,, can also be reduced. In one embodiment of the topology, the source termination is connected to a capacitor, which naturally has a low impedance at 3f,, as shown in FIG. 13. The gate termination at 3f, has a relatively large equivalent imped- ance. The simulated power loss at 3fo in the lossy gate resistor is about 1 W, which is much lower than the power delivered to the antenna (about 140 W) close to the peak\n\nvalue in FIG. 12.\n\n[0191] As mentioned, good impedance matching is useful for delivering high power to the antenna effectively. Based on the obtained optimum Z,,_3f, in the above disclosure, the impedance of the antenna should be tuned to about 6.4+j23Q after de-embedding the Zs_3f, shown in FIG. 13.\n\n[0192] In one embodiment, a capacitive coupling antenna feeding method as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B are used. The desired input impedance can be easily obtained by tuning and ds of the transmission line portion shown in FIG. 4B.\n\n[0193] FIG. 14A shows the final designed input imped- ance, i.e., simulated input impedance of a patch antenna in the unit cell 400 of FIG. 4A at 3f,. FIG. 14B shows simulated gain of a patch antenna in the unit cell 400 of FIG. 4A at f, and 3f,. As shown in FIG. 14A, the small coupling capacitance can be used to suppress fundamental radiation, evidenced by the difference in the simulated gain of the array. In one example design, a significant gain difference of about 36 dB can be realized.\n\n1\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n[0194] A 12x12 coupled oscillator array and a 1x2 unit cell are designed based on the above embodiments (in particular FIGS. 2-4B) and fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS process.\n\n[0195] FIG. 15 shows a die micrograph of an integrated circuit (chip) of a 12x12 coupled oscillator array fabricated in accordance with the 12x12 coupled oscillator array of FIG. 3A. FIG. 16 shows a die micrograph of an integrated. circuit (chip) ofa 1x2 unit cell (of a coupled oscillator array) fabricated in accordance with the 1x2 unit cell of FIG. 4A. In this example, the whole chip size of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array is 2 mmx1.7 mm, and the core area is 1.8 mmx1.5 mm.\n\n[0196] FIG. 17 shows an example measurement setup for measuring frequency, radiation pattern, and effective isotro- pic radiated power (EIRP) of the fabricated chip (of the array and the unit cell). In the example measurement setup of FIG. 17, a VDI WR1.5 SAX mixer (Virginia Diodes Inc.) con- nected to the Keysight signal analyzer N9041B (Keysight Technologies, Inc.) is used to detect the radiation signal of the chip (of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array) received by the VDI WR1.5 diagonal horn antenna (Virginia Diodes Tnc.). As shown in FIG. 17, an absorber is used to cover the front metal panel of the mixer to avoid multiple reflections.\n\n[0197] FIG. 19A shows the measured spectrum of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array at 674.85 GHz. The output frequencies can be tuned by changing the supply and bias voltages. FIG. 19B shows simulated and measured frequency tuning range associated with the 12x12 coupled oscillator array of FIG. 15. As shown in FIG. 19B, a 6.9% tuning range exists from 643 GHz to 689 GHz. It is noted the bias voltage shown in FIG. 19B is for one subarray of the array, and the bias voltages for other subarrays are slightly tuned to ensure that the radiated terahertz electromagnetic radiation beam is in the broadside direction.\n\n[0198] The EIRP and radiated power are also measured. with the beam tuned for broadside radiation. In the mea- surement, the distance between the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array and horn antenna is about 30 cm, satisfying the far-field condition. The path loss, conversion loss of the mixer, and cable loss are calibrated using the example calibration setup in FIG. 18. With the calibrated data and measured power from the spectrum analyzer, the EIRP of the chip is calculated and shown in FIG. 20, which shows simulated and measured effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array of FIG. 15.\n\n[0199] In this embodiment, the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array radiates from the front side using the patch antenna arrangement. Thus, the chip can be thermally coupled with a thermal management device on another side (e.g., the back side) for regulating the temperature of the chip. In this example, the chip is directly attached to a heat sink for heat dissipation. In this example, a thermoelectric cooler and a fan are further used to transfer the heat more effectively from the chip to lower the operation temperature, as shown in FIG. 17.\n\n[0200] The two thermal images in FIG. 17 compare the operating temperature of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array under peak power consumption using the two heat dissipation methods (one method uses only heat sink (the lower thermal image), another method uses heat sink as well as thermoelectric cooler and fan (the upper thermal image)). The lowered operating temperature can\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nlead to higher output power and hence higher EIRP, as shown in FIG. 20. In this example, by using the thermo- electric cooler and fan, EIRP improvement of about 2 dBm can be obtained. In this example, the measured peak EIRP is 30.8 dBm at 674.9 GHz.\n\n[0201] In one measurement, the phase noise is directly measured using the spectrum analyzer. FIG. 21A shows the measured phase noise of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array at 675 GHz. FIG. 21B shows measured phase noises at 1 MHz offset at different frequencies. For comparison, the phase noise performance of the fabricated 1x2 unit cell is also measured, and the results for different frequencies are also shown in FIG. 21B. It can be seen that, compared to the 1x2 unit cell, the phase noise improvement of the 12x12 is close to the theoretical value.\n\narray\n\n[0202] The motorized rotary stage in the measurement setup in FIG. 17 is used for facilitating radiation pattern measurement.\n\n[0203]\n\nFIG. 22A shows the simulated and measured radia-\n\ntion patterns (E- and H-plane patterns) of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array at 675 GHz. It can be seen that the results are in good agreement, especially for the patterns in the E-plane. In this example, as the coupling strength of the coupled oscillator array in the E-plane is high, the phase error due to the device mismatch is not obvious, and so the array can maintain a relatively ideal out-of-phase coupling mode in that plane. In this example, in contrast, the coupling strength is weaker for the in-phase coupling mode due to the smaller injection current, as\n\nillustrated in the equivalent circuit in FIG. 5. [0204] Based on the measured E- and H-plane patterns at\n\ndifferent frequencies, the corresponding directivities are calculated and compared with the simulated values. FIG. 22B shows simulated and calculated directivities of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array. It is found that the calculated directivities from the measured two planes are about 1 dB lower compared to the corresponding simulated values, which is different from the well-matched patterns as illustrated in FIG. 22A. In this example, the simulated directivity is calculated based on the whole 3D radiation field distribution but the calculated directivity is an average result of only two measured planes, thus this may result in error, especially with different beamwidths in the two the simulated for radi-\n\nFIG. 23B.\n\nIt is found that the simulated DC\n\npower sumption is higher than the measurement result under the same supply voltage, and the measured power consumption under V,,=1.4V is close to the simulated results with V,=1. 2V. The reason for this may be the voltage drop in the bonding wires, as the DC current can be as high as 2.6 A. In this example the supply voltage V, is measured on the printed circuit board (PCB), and the voltage drop in the bonding wires will lead to a smaller voltage applied to the transistor. Apart from inaccuracy of the model, the voltage drop issue may also account for the difference between simulation and measurement in EIRP.\n\nIn this embodiment, tuning the bias voltage of the\n\n[0205]\n\nperipheral subarrays (V, or V4) can effectively change the stable phase relationship, as verified by the simulated phase in FIG. 24A, in which V,, is set at 0.8V and the remaining subarrays are kept at 1V. Thus, the radiation beam in the H-plane can be steered. V,,, and Yes are slightly adjusted in the measurement, and the measured radiation patterns and. corresponding bias configuration are shown in FIGS. 24B and 24C. It is found that in this example the radiation beam in the H plane can be scanned from -45\u00b0 to +450 (5 dB\n\ndegradation).\n\n[0206]\n\nSome of the above embodiments of the invention\n\nave provided a differentially-fed, patch-antenna-based 2D scalable array with beamforming function and high dc-to- THz conversion efficiency. One example embodiment of the invention has provided a 12x12 coupled oscillator array chip, which occupies a 2 mmx1.7 mm area, and can operate between 643 GHz and 689 GHz (6.9%) and radiate a peak power of 9.1 dBm with 3.32-W power consumption (which implies a 0.245% de-to-THz efficiency at 675 GHz). In that example embodiment, the corresponding lensless EIRP is 30.8 dBm, and the measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset is -90.9 dBc/Hz. In that example embodiment, the beam can be steered from -45\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 in the H-plane.
