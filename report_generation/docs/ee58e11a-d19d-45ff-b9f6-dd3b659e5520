No. 12/435,979, by CHUNG et al., entitled \u201cAN OUTPUT COMPENSATOR FOR A REGULA- TOR\u201d.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n25\n\nThe present invention relates generally to components, elements and/or circuits for reducing or suppressing parasitic inductance and/or resistive effects that affect the frequency response of the components, elements and/or circuits in an electronic circuit or system. The invention relates particularly to methods and apparatus for reducing, suppressing or even cancelling noise generated by parasitic inductance and/or parasitic resistance of the components, the physical orienta- tion of the components, and/or the layout of components, devices and/or conductive tracks (board traces) on printed circuit boards within an electronic circuit or system.\n\nOne prior-art approach for overcoming the parasitic effects is to connect several capacitors of different types in parallel so that different frequency ranges can be covered. However, this only partially resolves the problem at the expense of increas- ing the physical size, complexity and cost of the electronic circuit or system. Moreover, the added capacitors might reso- nate with the stray inductance within the circuit and the ESL of other added capacitors.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nThere are two main approaches to canceling the effects parasitic inductance on a circuit or system. The first is based canceling the parasitic inductance of a particular compo- nent while the second is based on canceling the effect caused all parasitic inductances in the entire circuit or system.\n\nsystems presents unique challenges for circuit designers. The operating frequency of modern electrical and electronic equipment continues to increase, in order to reduce the physi- cal size and weight of the electronic circuits and systems. However, the trend is hindered by the possible generation of undesirable effects, such as ringing and resonance, due to parasitic effects associated with the components, the physical orientation of the components, and/or the layout of compo- nents, devices and/or conductive tracks on printed circuit boards within an electronic circuit or system. These parasitic elements degrade the high-frequency performance of the entire electronic circuit\n\nAs shown in FIG. 5, some coupled magnetic windings 11a, 11d are used to nullify the effect of the parasitic inductance of the capacitor 10. The coupled windings 11a, 114 will give an equivalent negative inductance in series with the capacitor. Although the ESL can be canceled, the structure will produce an additional inductance in series with the load 36. Moreover, it cannot cancel the ESR effect. This will affect the dynamic behavior of the output voltage across the load 36. Such struc- ture is more suitable for input filter design. Nevertheless, the coupling effect is highly dependent on the magnetic proper- ties of the core materials of the coupled windings.\n\nThere are many electronic circuit or system designs where parasitic inductance is a significant element that restricts cir- cuit performance. Given an applied voltage, the parasitic inductance limits the rate at which the current can change. At high frequencies, parasitic inductance can have a major impact on chip performance and can cause chip failure if inductance is not properly detected and corrected. Self induc- tance is a property of a circuit whereby a change in current causes a change in voltage especially in circuit designs con- taining long paths or board traces. Mutual inductance com- prises the full electromagnetic effect of one current loop over another especially in circuit designs containing long paths that shielded.\n\nA prior-art method using the second approach is based on adding passive circuits. The parasitic effects are canceled at the circuit level. By extending the first approach, a coupled. winding that can cancel parasitic inductance of capacitors in an electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter has been pro- posed. In other approaches, some active noise cancellation circuits that can cancel the undesired effects caused by the parasitic elements have been proposed.\n\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\n\nAn object of the invention is to mitigate and/or obviate to some degree one or more problems associated with known\n\nA capacitor is one of the key components in the input and output filters of an electrical circuit.
