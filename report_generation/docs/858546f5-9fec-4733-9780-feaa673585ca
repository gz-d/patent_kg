These fundamental properties of the EM wave can be function of space 7 and time t. For example, the electric field of a plane-wave can be expressed as E(r , t}-\u20ac\u00e9A cos(2nft+le : 7\n\n+).\n\n[0005] Electromagnetic (EM) wave related technologies are closely related to the control and utilization of these fundamental properties of EM waves. Conventional EM wave manipulation techniques primarily rely on the accu- mulated propagation effect in naturally-existing dielectric materials, such as lenses, optical modulators, and wave- plates. These optical components are often bulky and have curved shapes, which make them unsuitable for modern integrated electronic and photonic systems.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0006] In a first aspect, there is provided a metasurface structure for an antenna. The metasurface structure includes a plurality of subwavelength units operable to manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum (i.e., all of these five properties) of electromag- netic waves for radiation. The subwavelength units may be referred to as \u201cmeta-atoms\u201d. It should be noted that the metasurface structure includes a plurality of subwavelength units operable to manipulate or control all of the five listed properties, the metasurface structure need not always oper- ate to manipulate or control all five properties at the same time; instead the metasurface structure can manipulate or control any one or more (up to all) of them at the same time. For example, the plurality of subwavelength units may be controlled by a controller to manipulate or control ampli- tude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum (e.g., all of these five properties) of electromagnetic waves for radiation.\n\n[0007] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum (ie., all of these five properties) of electromagnetic waves.\n\n[0008] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to selectively manipulate or control\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\namplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momen- tum of electromagnetic waves. For example, the plurality of subwavelength units may be operable to manipulate or control only one or some (i.e., not all) of the five properties at a time.\n\n[0009] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to dynamically manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum (le., one or more of these five properties) of electromagnetic waves.\n\n[0010] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to simultaneously manipulate or control at least two of amplitude, phase, polarization, fre- quency, and momentum of electromagnetic waves. For example, in some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units may be operable to manipulate or control two or more of these five properties at the same time.\n\n[0011] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to independently manipulate or control at least two of amplitude, phase, polarization, fre- quency, and momentum of electromagnetic waves. In other words, in some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to manipulate or control two or more of these five properties independently.\n\n[0012] In some embodiments, each of the plurality of subwavelength units is selectively operable in (e.g., con- trolled to selectively operate in) a first operation state and a second operation state, to facilitate manipulation or control of the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Each of the plurality of subwavelength units may or may not be selectively operable in one or more other operation states. In some embodiments, the first operation state comprises a radiating state in which the corresponding subwavelength unit radi- ates electromagnetic waves and the second operation state comprises a non-radiating state in which the corresponding subwavelength unit does not radiate electromagnetic waves. In some embodiments, the first operation state comprises a first radiating state and the second operation state comprises a second radiating state different from the first radiating state. For example, the first and second radiating states may correspond to different extents of radiation of electromag- netic waves.\n\n[0013] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are arranged in an array. In some embodiments, plurality of subwavelength units are generally aligned.\n\nthe\n\n[0014] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units may be arranged in a 1D array. In some embodiments, the plurality of subwavelength units may be arranged in a 2D array. For example, the plurality of subwavelength units may be generally aligned in one or more rows and one or more columns. The plurality of subwavelength units of the array may be spaced apart evenly or unevenly.\n\n[0015] In some embodiments, each of the plurality of subwavelength units respectively comprises: a first slot formed on or in an electrically conductive layer and operable to radiate electromagnetic waves, a second slot formed on or in the electrically conductive layer and operable to radiate electromagnetic waves, a first control arrangement operably coupled with the first slot for facilitating control of operation of the first slot selectively in a radiating state (in which the first slot radiates electromagnetic waves) and a non-radiating state (in which the first slot does not radiate electromagnetic\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nwaves), and a second control arrangement operably coupled with the second slot for facilitating control of operation o the second slot selectively in a radiating state (in which the second slot radiates electromagnetic waves) and a non- radiating state (in which the second slot does not radiate electromagnetic waves). The first control arrangement and the second control arrangement may each be respectively controllable by a controller. In some examples, each sub- wavelength unit may be selectively operable in two or more of the following operation states: (1) the first and second slots are both in radiating state, (2) the first slot is in radiating state whereas the second slot is in non-radiating state, (3) the first slot is in non-radiating state whereas the second slot is in radiating state, and (4) the first and second slots are both in non-radiating state.\n\n[0016] In some embodiments, the first slot and the second slot may have generally the same shape and/or size. In some embodiments, the first slot and the second slot have different orientations. In some embodiments, the first slot and the second slot are both shaped as a loop. For example, the loop may be generally elliptical, generally obround, generally oblong, generally oval, generally triangular, generally rect- angular (e.g., squared), generally polygonal, etc.\n\n[0017] In some embodiments, the first slot (e.g., the loop) extends generally along a first axis and the second slot (e.g., the loop) extends generally along a second axis. The first axis and the second axis may be arranged at a non-zero angle (i.e., not parallel). In some examples, the first axis and the second axis may be arranged at about 90 degrees.\n\n[0018] In some embodiments, the first slot is operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with a first eigen-polarization state (e.g., first linear polarization state) and the second slot is operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with a second eigen-polarization state (e.g., second linear polarization state) orthogonal to the first eigen-polarization state (e.g., first linear polarization state).\n\n[0019] Insome embodiments, the first slots of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same orientation. In some embodiments, the first slots of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same shape and/or size. In some embodiments, the second slots of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same orientation. In some embodiments, the second slots of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same shape and/or size. In some embodiments, the first control arrangements of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same basic construction. In some embodiments, the second con- trol arrangements of the plurality of subwavelength units have the basic construction.\n\ngenerally\n\nsame\n\n[0020] In some embodiments, the first control arrange- ment comprises at least two control elements operably coupled with the first slot for affecting operation of the first slot and the second control arrangement comprises at least two control elements operably coupled with the second slot for affecting operation of the second slot. The at least two control elements of the first control arrangement and the at least two control elements of the second control arrangement may be controlled by a controller. In one example, the controller may provide a first control signal to control the at least two control elements of the first control arrangement and a second control signal to control the at least two control elements of the second control arrangement.\n\n[0021] In some embodiments, the at least two control elements of the first control arrangement comprise a first\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nsemiconductor element and a second semiconductor element each selectively operable in an ON state and an OFF state, for affecting operation of the first slot hence the operation state of the corresponding subwavelength unit. The first and second semiconductor elements of the first control arrange- ment may comprise semiconductor diodes, such as PIN diodes.

The meta- surface structure 102 includes multiple subwavelength units (e.g., meta-atoms, labeled as \u201cU\u201d) operable to manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves for radiation. Depend- ing on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may manipulate or control one, or two, or three, or four, or all of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum). The metasurface structure 102 may be operably connected with a controller 10. The con- troller 10 may provide control signals to the metasurface\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nstructure 102 to facilitate the manipulation or control ampli- tude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves by the metasurface structure 102.\n\n[0108] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can selectively manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may selectively manipulate or control one, or two, or three, or four of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum) at a time.\n\n[0109] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can dynamically manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may dynami- cally manipulate or control one, or two, or three, or four of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).\n\n[0110] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can simultaneously manipu- late or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may simulta- neously manipulate or control two, or three, or four, or all of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).\n\n[0111] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can independently manipu- late or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may indepen- dently manipulate or control at least two of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).\n\n[0112] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can independently, simulta- neously, and dynamically control at least two of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).\n\n[0113] Each of the subwavelength units of the metasurface structure 102 may be selectively operable in (e.g.: controlled by the controller 10 to operate in) different operation states to facilitate manipulation or control of the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromag- netic waves. For example, each of the subwavelength units may be selectively operable in a radiating state (that radiates electromagnetic waves) and a non-radiating state (that does not radiate electromagnetic waves). For example, each of the subwavelength units may be selectively operable in a stron- ger radiating state and a weaker radiating state. The elec- tromagnetic waves radiated by the various subwavelength units of the metasurface structure 102 may be combined in time and space to form a resultant electromagnetic wave.\n\n[0114] In some embodiments, the subwavelength units of the metasurface structure 102 may are arranged in an array, such as a 1D array or a 2D array. For example, the sub- wavelength units may be generally aligned in one or more rows and one or more columns. The subwavelength units may be spaced apart evenly or unevenly.\n\n[0115] The subwavelength units of the metasurface struc- ture 102 may have generally the same construction. In some embodiments, each subwavelength units respectively include: at least two slots formed on or in an electrically\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nconductive layer and each respectively operable to radiate electromagnetic waves, and respective control arrangements each operably coupled with a respective one of the at least two slots to facilitate control of operation of the correspond- ing slot selectively in a radiating state (that radiates elec- tromagnetic waves) and a non-radiating state (that does not radiate electromagnetic waves).\n\nInsome\n\nall\n\nthe\n\nleast\n\nslots of the\n\n[0116] examples, of at two same subwavelength unit may be in the radiating state to radiate electromagnetic waves. In some examples, only one or some of the at least two slots of the same subwavelength unit may be in the radiating state to radiate electromagnetic waves. In some examples, all of the at least two slots of the same subwavelength unit may be in the non-radiating state. The control arrangements may be operably connected with hence controlled by the controller 10. In some embodiments, the at least two slots of the same subwavelength unit may have generally the same shape and/or size. For example, each of the at least two slots of the same subwavelength unit may be shaped as a loop, which may be generally elliptical, generally obround, generally oblong, generally oval, gener- ally triangular, generally rectangular (e.g., squared), gener- ally polygonal, etc. In some embodiments, each of the at least two slots of the same subwavelength unit may have different orientations. For example, one of the slots may extend generally along an axis and another one of the slots may extend generally along another axis that is at an angle (e.g., acute angle, right angle, etc.) to the axis. In one example, the angle is about 90 degrees. In some embodi- ments, each of the at least two slots of the same subwave- length unit may be operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with a respective polarization state. For example, one of the slots may be operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with a first eigen-polarization state (e.g., first linear polarization state) and another one of the slots may be operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with a second eigen-polarization state (e.g., second linear polarization state) orthogonal to the first eigen-polarization state. For each subwavelength unit, its control arrangements may each include at least two control elements operably coupled with the corresponding slot for affecting operation of the corre- sponding slot. The at least two control elements of the control arrangements may be controlled by the controller 10. For example, the controller may provide respective control\n\nsignal to respective one of the control arrangement.\n\n[0117] The control elements of the control arrangements may be semiconductor elements, each of which may be selectively operable in an ON state and an OFF state for affecting operation of the corresponding slot to which the control element is operably coupled with. In some examples, the semiconductor elements may be semiconductor diodes, such as PIN diodes. In some examples, the semiconductor elements of the same control arrangement in a subwave- length unit may be arranged (e.g., controlled by the control- ler 10) to operate simultaneously in either the ON state or the OFF state. In some embodiments, the semiconductor ele- ments of the same control arrangement in a subwavelength unit are biased in the same bias state (e.g., a forward-biased. state, a non-biased state, etc.). In some embodiments, each of the control elements may be respectively connected across a slot portion of its corresponding slot. For example, each slot may include two control elements each connected across a respective slot portion of the slot. The two slot be arranged on opposite long sides of the slot\n\nportions may\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nshaped as a loop. In some embodiments, for each subwave- length unit, the two control elements of one of the slots is disposed generally along an axis (which, in some examples, is generally perpendicular to the axis along with the corre- sponding slot extends), and the two control elements of another one of the slots is disposed generally along another axis (which, in some examples, is generally perpendicular to the axis along with the corresponding slot extends) that is at an angle (e.g., acute angle, right angle, etc.) to the axis. In one example, the angle is about 90 degrees.\n\n[0118] FIG. 2 shows a metasurface antenna 200 in some embodiments of the invention. The metasurface antenna 200 includes a metasurface structure 202 and a waveguide 204 operably coupled with the metasurface structure. In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 202 is the metasur- face structure 102 of FIG. 1 (and the controller 20 may correspond to the controller 10 in FIG. 1). The waveguide 204 is operable to guide an electromagnetic wave and the metasurface structure 202 is operable to modulate the elec- tromagnetic wave and to radiate a modulated electromag- netic wave.\n\n[0119] In some embodiments, the waveguide 204 is oper- able to guide the electromagnetic wave, and the metasurface structure 202 is operable to radiate the modulated electro- magnetic wave away from the waveguide into free space. For example, the electromagnetic wave may be an in-plane wave (e.g., in-plane guided wave), and the modulated elec- tromagnetic wave may be an out-of-plane wave (e.g., out- of-plane propagating wave).\n\nembodiments, the metasurface structure\n\n[0120]\n\nIn\n\nsome 202 may be at least partly integrated with the waveguide 204.\n\n[0121] The waveguide 204 may be generally planar. The waveguide 204 may, e.g., be a substrate integrated wave- guide. In some embodiments, the substrate integrated wave- guide may include: a dielectric substrate, an electrically conductive layer arranged on one side of the dielectric substrate, another electrically conductive layer arranged in (e.g., embedded in) or arranged on (e.g., arrange don another side of) the dielectric substrate, multiple electrically con- ductive elements (vias fences, holes, posts, etc.) arranged in (e.g., extending at least partly through) the dielectric sub- strate and electrically connecting the two electrically con- ductive layers. The electrically conductive layers may each have even or uneven thickness. The dielectric substrate may have one or more layers, each with even or uneven thick- ness. The electrically conductive elements may be disposed in multiple rows (e.g., multiple generally parallel rows).\n\n[0122] The metasurface structure 202 is at least partly arranged on or in (e.g., etched in) the electrically conductive layer arranged on the one side of the dielectric substrate. For example, the slots of the subwavelength units of the meta- surface structure 202 may be formed (e.g., etched) in or on the electrically conductive layer. In some embodiments, each subwavelength unit of the metasurface structure 202 is respectively operably coupled with two or more of the electrically conductive elements (e.g., each slot operably coupled with at least one of the electrically conductive elements). The another electrically conductive layer may include a biasing circuit with multiple biasing circuit por- tions each respectively operably coupled with a respective subwavelength unit of the metasurface structure 202. The biasing circuit portion may bias the semiconductor elements of the same control arrangement in the corresponding sub-\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nwavelength unit in the same bias state. In some embodi- ments, the semiconductor elements of the control arrange- ments of the subwavelength units of the metasurface structure 202 are arranged to be controlled by the controller 20 to respectively selectively operate in ON state and OFF state, to respectively operate each respective subwavelength unit of the metasurface structure 202.\n\n[0123] FIG. 3 shows a controller 300 in some embodi- ments of the invention. The controller 300 may be used controller 10 in FIG. 1 or the controller 20 in FIG.\n\nthe\n\nas\n\n2.\n\n[0124]\n\nThe\n\ncontroller\n\n300\n\ngenerally\n\nincludes\n\nsuitable\n\ncomponents operable to receive, store, and execute appro- priate computer instructions, commands, and/or codes. The main components of the controller 300 are processor 302 and memory 304. The processor 302 may include one or more: CPU(s), MCU(s), GPU(s), logic circuit(s), Raspberry Pi chip(s), digital signal processor(s) (DSP), application- specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC), field-programmable gate array(s) (FPGA), or any other digital or analog cir- cuitry/circuitries configured to interpret and/or to execute program instructions and/or to process signals and/or infor- mation and/or data. The memory 304 may include one or more volatile memory (such as RAM, DRAM, SRAM, etc.), one or more non-volatile memory (such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FRAM, MRAM, FLASH, SSD, NAND, NVDIMM, etc.), or any of their combinations. Appropriate computer instructions, commands, codes, infor- mation and/or data may be stored in the memory 304. Computer instructions for executing or facilitating executing the method embodiments of the invention may be stored in the memory 304. For example, control signals (e.g., space- time coding sequences, space-time-coding matrixes, space- time-coding films, etc.) for controlling the operation of the subwavelength units (e.g., their control elements) of the metasurface structure may be stored in the memory 304. In some embodiments, the processor 302 and memory (stor- age) 304 may be integrated (i.e., memory 304 embedded in the processor 302). In some embodiments, the processor 302 and memory (storage) 304 may be separated (and operably connected). The controller 300 may be operable to establish power and/or data communication with the metasurface structure, e.g., via one or more of: cable, bus, wire, electrical conductor arrangements, etc. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that the controller 300 shown in FIG. 3 is merely an example and that the controller 300 can have\n\ndifferent configurations (e.g., include nents, etc.) in different embodiments.\n\nadditional\n\ncompo-\n\n[0125] The controller 300 may be part of a computing system, computing device, etc. It will also be appreciated that where the methods and systems of the invention are either wholly implemented by computing system or partly implemented by computing system then any appropriate computing system architecture may be utilized. This may include, e.g., stand-alone computers, network computers, dedicated or non-dedicated hardware devices. Where the terms \u201ccomputing system\u201d and \u201ccomputing device\u201d are used, these terms are intended to include (but not limited to) any appropriate arrangement of computer or information processing hardware capable of implementing the function described.\n\n[0126] The following disclosure provides concerns some embodiments of the invention which relate to a metasurface antenna operable to manipulate fundamental characteristics electromagnetic waves. These embodiments can be con-\n\nof\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nsidered as a more specific implementation of the metasur- face structure 102 of FIG. 1 and/or the metasurface antenna 200 of FIG. 2.\n\nInventors of the\n\ninvention\n\n[0127] present have, through their research, devised that metasurfaces allow wave-matter interactions within an ultrathin artificial surface, thus pro- vides a paradigm shift for EM-wave manipulations. Also, metasurfaces may manipulate the fundamental properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves and hence may potentially revolutionize various EM-wave based applications such as optics, telecommunications, material engineering, quantum systems, etc. That said, inventors of the present invention have appreciated that simultaneous and independent con- trols over multiple ones of, and in particular all of, the fundamental properties of EM waves with high integrability and/or programmability is challenging. Inventors of the present invention believe that there is a need to provide a \u201cuniversal\u201d metasurface that enables simultaneous and inde- pendent controls some and preferably over all of the fun- damental properties of EM waves.\n\n[0128]\n\nInventors of the present invention have, through\n\ntheir research, realized that a metasurface that can manipu- late all of the fundamental properties of EM waves remains elusive due to various challenges. For example, most exist- ing metasurfaces are passive in which their functionalities are set and cannot be altered once fabricated. Yet, many modern wave-empowered applications such as communica- tions, holographic displays, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), etc., require dynamic and active controls for environment adaptation and/or information processing. For example, while some tunable metasurfaces integrated with active functional materials have been explored to achieve dynamic wave controls upon the external stimuli (including electrical bias, mechanical deformation, optical pumping, and/or thermal excitation), most of these tunable metasur- faces can control only one or two wave properties due to insufficient degrees of freedom in the geometrical param- eters of the elements and the external control variables to support regulation of all of the fundamental properties. For example, independent wave properties manipulations may be difficult as the controls over these fundamental properties of EM wave are generally coupled with each other. While unique geometric structures and co-optimization with active materials may be adopted to decouple, e.g., amplitude and phase regulations, the design complexity and insertion loss are amplified geometrically with the increase of the control\n\ndegrees of freedom.\n\n[0129] Inventors of the present invention have, through their research, become aware that spatiotemporally modu- lated metasurface (STMM) is a technique that may be used. to engineer EM waves in both space and time. Specifically, spatiotemporally modulated metasurface may add a time dimension into conventional metasurface design, to enable various physical phenomena and wave manipulations in frequency-momentum spaces. However, to date, only lim- ited controls are validated for spatiotemporally modulated metasurfaces. Inventors of the present invention have real- ized that existing spatiotemporally modulated metasurface techniques may not be used to enable control of all funda- mental properties of EM waves using a radiation aperture, in particular to realize simultaneously and independently pro- grammable radiation characteristics.\n\n[0130] The following embodiments of the invention con- cern a universal metasurface antenna operable to control all\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nof the five fundamental properties of radiated EM waves,\n\ndynamically, simultaneously, independently, and precisely. In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna that can control all of the fundamental properties of radiated EM waves may operate to control only one or more of the fundamental properties of radiated EM waves. In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna may fur- ther facilitate spatial- and time-varying wave properties, hence enable generation of more complicated waveform, beamforming, direct information manipulations, etc. In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna can directly generate modulated EM waves that carry digital information, thus may fundamentally simplify the architec- ture of information transmission systems. In some embodi- ments, all wave manipulations and information modulations are achieved via spatiotemporally switching the ON-OFF coding states of the meta-atoms (subwavelength units) of the metasurface antenna. The metasurface antenna in these embodiments may provide improved EM wave and infor- mation manipulation capabilities, which may be particularly useful in applications such as next-generation wireless sys- tems, cognitive sensing, imaging, quantum optics, quantum.\n\ninformation science, etc.\n\n[0131] FIG. 4A shows a metasurface antenna 400 in embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4B shows part of metasurface antenna 400 of FIG. 4A in greater detail.\n\none\n\nthe\n\n[0132] In this embodiment, the metasurface antenna 400 generally includes a substrate integrated waveguide 404 and a metasurface structure 402 operably coupled with the substrate integrated waveguide 404. The substrate integrated waveguide 404 is operable to receive and guide an in-plane electromagnetic wave (guided wave). The metasurface structure 402 is arranged to extract and modulate the in- plane electromagnetic wave, and radiate an out-of-plane modulated electromagnetic wave (propagating wave). In this embodiment, the metasurface structure 402 is integrated with the substrate integrated waveguide 404.\n\n[0133] In this embodiment, as best shown in FIG. 4B, the substrate integrated waveguide 404 includes a dielectric substrate, an upper electrically conductive layer arranged on top of the dielectric substrate, a lower electrically conductive layer embedded in the dielectric substrate, and multiple parallel rows of metallic via holes arranged in the dielectric substrate and electrically connecting the two electrically conductive layers.\n\n[0134]\n\nIn this embodiment, the metasurface structure 402\n\nincludes multiple subwavelength units (Le., meta-atoms) operable to manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polar- ization, frequency, and momentum of electromagnetic waves for radiation. As the metasurface structure 402 may manipulate or control all of these properties of electromag- netic waves, the metasurface antenna 400 may be referred to as a universal metasurface antenna 400. In this example, the metasurface structure 402 may independently, simultane- ously, and dynamically manipulate or control two or more of the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momen- tum of electromagnetic waves for radiation. In one example, each of the plurality of subwavelength units may be selec- tively operable in a first operation state and a second. operation state (e.g., a radiating state and a non-radiating state, or a stronger radiating state and a weaker radiating state) to facilitate manipulation or control of the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of elec-\n\ntromagnetic waves.\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\n[0135]\n\nAs shown in FIG. 4A, the subwavelength units are\n\ngenerally aligned to form an array, and they have generally the same construction. Specifically, each of the subwave- length units respectively includes: two generally rectangular loop-shaped slots etched in the upper electrically conductive layer of the substrate integrated waveguide 404, two PIN diodes operably coupled with one of the generally rectan- gular loop-shaped slots, and two other PIN diodes operably coupled with another one of the generally rectangular loop- shaped slots. The PIN diodes operably coupled with the corresponding rectangular loop-shaped slot may facilitate control of operation of the slot selectively in a radiating state (in which it radiates electromagnetic waves) and a non- radiating state (in which it does not radiate electromagnetic\n\nwaves). [0136] The two rectangular loop-shaped slots of the same\n\nsubwavelength unit have generally the same shape and size but different orientations. Specifically, one of the slots extend generally along an axis and another one of the slots extend generally along another axis. The two axes are arranged at about 90 degrees. The two rectangular loop- shaped slots may be operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with orthogonal eigen-polarization state (each slot operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with a respective eigen-polarization state). For each of the two rectangular loop-shaped slots, the corresponding two PIN diodes are connected across two opposite slot portions on the opposite long sides of the corresponding slot. In this example, the two PIN diodes of one of the generally rectangular loop-shaped slots is disposed generally along a first axis (which is generally perpendicular to the extension axis of the corre- sponding slot) and the two PIN diodes of another one of the generally rectangular loop-shaped slots is disposed gener- ally along a second axis (which is generally perpendicular to the extension axis of the corresponding slot). The first and\n\nsecond axes\n\nare generally perpendicular. The PIN diodes are controllable by control signals\n\n[0137]\n\n(e.g., space time coding sequence of \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d) provided by a controller such as field-programmable gate array(s) (not shown). Specifically, in this embodiment, the PIN diodes are each selectively operable in an ON state and an OFF state, for affecting operation of the corresponding slot to which they are operably coupled. The two PIN diodes of the same slot may be controlled by the same control signal or other- wise arranged to operate simultaneously in either the ON state or the OFF state, thus selectively operating the corre- sponding slot in either the radiating state or the non- radiating state. The PIN diodes of the same slot may be biased by a biasing circuit (or a portion of it) to the same bias state (forward-biased, no bias, etc.). In this embodiment, the biasing circuit is formed or arranged in the lower electrically\n\nconductive layer of the substrate integrated waveguide 404.\n\n[0138] The following description provides further details on various aspects or example operations of the metasurface antenna 400. As used herein, the metasurface antenna 400 may be referred to as a universal metasurface antenna 400.\n\n[0139] The following description makes reference to the various Figures in an order different from the order as the Figures appear. Thus, for ease of presentation, some brief description of the various Figures is provided before further description is provided.\n\n[0140] FIGS. 4A to 9 generally relate to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for independent controls of all fundamental EM wave properties. Specifically, FIG.\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\n4A shows the universal metasurface antenna 400. Briefly, as shown in 4A, slot-opening based meta-atoms are\n\nFIG.\n\narranged at the top of the substrate integrated waveguide 404 to convert the guided wave into propagating wave with software-defined properties. 1-bit \u201c0/1\u201d space-time-coding sequences are applied to switch the meta-atoms between radiating (\u201c1\u201d) and non-radiating (\u201c0\u201d) states, thus control- ling the fundamental properties of the radiated wave. In this example, only the momentum of the target harmonic fre- quency (m=+1 harmonic in this example) matches with that of free space; other unwanted higher-order harmonics are suppressed in both the waveguide and free space without phase-matching. FIG. 4B shows the configuration of the anisotropic meta-atom, which includes two +45\u00b0-inclined loop-shaped slot openings each loaded with a pair of PIN diodes. FIG. 5 shows measured frequency shifting with different modulation frequencies. The inset in FIG. 5 shows the measured spectrum in dB scale with the modulation frequency of 1.8 MHz. FIGS. 6 to 9 illustrate manipulations of the EM wave properties by the universal metasurface antenna 400. Specifically, FIG. 6 relates to momentum control, FIG. 7 relates to phase control, FIG. 8 relates to amplitude control, and FIG. 9 relates to polarization control. In these examples, the controls are achieved by adjusting or tuning the time gradient ot,(x)/ox, reference time shift t,_,, duty cycle t, and time gradient and reference time shift for the lu), lv) polarizations, respectively. In these examples of FIGS. 6 to 9, the input frequency and modulation frequency\n\nare fo=23.3 GHz and f,-1.8 MHz, respectively. [0141] FIG. relates to the universal metasurface\n\n10\n\nantenna 400 arranged for simultaneous manipulation of various properties of the radiated EM wave. FIG. 10 con- tains 9 plots arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. Specifically, FIG. 10, in the first row plots a to c, shows the measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna at the fundamental frequency with the Ix) polariza- tion, whose main beam scans to -40\u00b0, 0\u00b0, and 40\u00b0, respec- tively. FIG. 10, in the second row plots d to f, shows the measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal meta- surface antenna at the fundamental frequency with the lu ) polarization, whose main beam scans to -40?, 0\u00b0, and 40\u00b0. FIG. 10, in the second row plots g to i, shows the measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface\n\nantenna when the frequency of the extracted propagating\n\nwave is changed to the m=+1 harmonic, with the I) polar- ization, whose main beam scans to -40\u00b0, 0\u00b0, and 40\u00b0. The three lines in each plots demonstrate the amplitude controls of the radiated propagating waves. In this example, the input frequency and modulation frequency are fy=23.5 GHz and fy=1.2 MHz, respectively.\n\nFIGS. 11 to 17 relate to the universal metasurface\n\n[0142]\n\nantenna 400 arranged for more-complicated beam shaping with the spatial-varying wave properties. Specifically, FIG. 11 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for generating an Airy beam at the m=-1 harmonic fre- quency in free space. In this example, the Airy beam requires a spatial-varying phase profile as 4/3a\",,(-x)*. FIG. 12 shows the required aperture phase profile of the Airy wave- front and the corresponding normalized time shiftings for the meta-atoms of the metasurface antenna 400 at different positions. FIG. 13 shows the measured E-field intensities in the xz-plane at different harmonic frequencies. In FIG. 13, the dashed line represents the theoretical parabolic trajectory\n\nof the Airy beam x=az? (in this example, the acceleration\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nfactor a\u20140.003). Only the target m=-1 harmonic frequency possesses high field intensity; other harmonic frequencies are all highly suppressed in free space. FIG. 14 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for light focus- ing at the m=-1 harmonic frequency. In this example, the local momentum or output angle of the extracted propagat- ing waves from all meta-atoms of the metasurface antenna 400 are different. FIG. 15 shows the required normalized local momentum k/&,, as a function of the meta-atom position for different focal spot positions from F, to Fs, where F,=(-100 mm, 80 mm), F,;=(-70 mm, 80 mm), F; (-40 mm, 80 mm), F, (-10 mm, 80 mm), and Fs (20 mm, 80 mm). FIG. 16 shows the measured E-field intensities at the m=-1 harmonic frequency along the line z=80 mm as the focal spot scans from Fi to F;. FIG. 17 shows the corre- sponding measured E-field intensities in the xz-plane at the m=-1 harmonic frequency for different focus spots Fi to F;.\n\n[0143] FIGS. 18 to 22 relate to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for information modulations with the time-varying wave properties. Specifically, FIG. 18 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 used to directly generate the information-carried EM waves in free space. FIG. 18 also shows the measured decoded constellation diagrams and eye diagrams at the receiver end with QPSK at the m=+1 harmonic frequency (left) and 16QAM at the fundamental frequency (right), as well as the one-to-one mapping relationship among the transmitted digital infor- mation stream, the radiated information-carried waves in the free space (2PSK in this example), and the applied animate STC matrices (STC films) for communications at the m=+1 harmonic frequency. The required STC films for other modulation schemes and at the fundamental frequency are presented in FIGS. 34 and 35. FIG. 19 illustrates the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for directly generating two independently modulated waves carrying different digital data streams. Two designated users at dif- ferent locations can simultaneously and independently receive the information from the universal metasurface antenna. In this example, the required STC films for multi- channels are shown in FIG. 37. FIG. 20 shows the measured. radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna 400 at the m=-1 (CH1) and m=-2 (CH2) harmonic frequencies. The insets on the right in FIG. 20 present the measured decoded constellation diagrams of the two channels at the receiver end. More results about multiplexing in different beam directions are presented in FIGS. 38 and 39. FIG. 21 illustrates the universal metasurface antenna 400 with the inherent direction modulation property at the fundamental frequency. In this example, only the target user in the main beam direction can successfully decode the information, whereas eavesdroppers at other positions totally lose the information. FIG. 21 shows the measured radiation pattern of the universal metasurface antenna, and the measured decoded constellation diagrams when the receiver is located in different directions. The physical-layer security commu- nication link for other main-beam directions is validated in FIGS. 44 to 47. In FIGS. 18 to 22, \u201cCW\u201d means continuous wave; \u201cDig. Info.\u201d means digital information; \u201cMod\u201d means\n\nmodulated; \u201cAnt.\u201d antenna; \u201cVSA\u201d signal analyzer; \u201cCH\u201d means channel; \u201cEVM\u201d means vector magnitude.\n\nmeans\n\nmeans\n\nvector\n\nerror\n\n[0144] FIGS. 23 to 26 relate to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for wave manipulations with fre- quency shifting. Specifically, FIG. 23 shows the configura-\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\ntion of the universal metasurface antenna 400 with a meta- atom array located on the top of the waveguide. In this embodiment, each meta-atom includes two +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to radiate two orthogonal eigen-polarization\n\nlu\n\n)\n\nand IW states. PIN diodes, controlled by the external control signals from FGPA, are embedded into each slot opening to switch the meta-atom between the radiating (coding element \u201c1\u201d) and non-radiating (coding element \u201cQ\u201d) states in real time. FIG. 24 shows the formulation of the \u201c0/1\u201d STC matrix, representing the radiating/non-radiating states of all the meta-atoms at one modulation period. Each inclined slot opening has its own independent time-coding sequence. The STC matrix includes two parts: the upper and\n\nlower parts correspond to slot-opening columns for It) and\n\nlv) polarization radiations, respectively. FIG. 25 shows the time sequence for each meta-atom with a time shift t,. FIG. 26 shows the operation principle of the universal metasur- face antenna 400 for wavefront manipulation at harmonic frequencies. The total phase shift of the extracted wave includes two parts: the phase accumulation due to the propagation of the guided wave @oy=-EGyx,, and the abrupt phase shift induced by the spatiotemporal modulation @s7--2amf, A(x). The time shifts applied to the meta-atoms can control the momentum and phase at the target harmonic frequency.\n\n[0145] FIG. 27 relates to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for frequency shifting. Specifically, FIG. 27 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 up- converts the input frequency fo to f)+f,, in free space. In this example, the input frequency and modulation frequency are {,=23.5 GHz and f,-1.2 MHz respectively. FIG. 27 also shows the measured input spectrum and the residual spec- trum of the waveguide, and the output spectrum in free space. In this example, the harmonic frequencies inside the waveguide and free space are suppressed by as much as 25 dB and 21 dB below the fundamental frequency, respec- tively, due to the large momentum mismatch inside the waveguide and free space. The residual power of the wave- guide at the fundamental frequency is 14.7 dB below the input one due to the guided-wave-to-propagating-wave con- version of the metasurface antenna.\n\n[0146] FIGS. 28 to 33 relate to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for wave manipulation without fre- quency shifting. Specifically, FIG. 28 shows the guided- wave-to-propagating-wave conversion or translation at the fundamental frequency (m=0). In this example, spatiotem- poral modulation forms an equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envelope along the length of the metasurface aperture of the metasurface antenna 400. The n=-1 space harmonic becomes fast and radiates into free space with arbitrary software-defined wave properties. FIG. 29 shows the ran- domization of the STC matrix to suppress higher-order harmonic frequencies. FIGS. 30 to 33 illustrate independent EM wave properties manipulation at the fundamental fre- quency. Specifically, FIG. 30 relates to polarization control, FIG. 31 relates to momentum control, FIG. 32 relates to phase control, and FIG. 33 relates to amplitude control. In these examples, the controls are achieved by tuning the equivalent spatial period A, space shift Ax of the amplitude envelope, modulation depth M, and spatial period and\n\nspace\n\nshift for the Iu), Iv) polarizations, respectively.\n\n[0147] FIGS. 34 and 35 relate to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for information manipulation with\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\ntime-varying wave properties. Specifically, FIG. 34 illus- trates the one-to-one mapping relationship among the QPSK symbol set in the constellation diagram, transmitted signal set, and STC matrix set (m=+1 harmonic frequency radia- tion in this example). FIG. 35 illustrates the digital baseband. signals, the corresponding modulated free-space waveforms, and the required STC films (at the fundamental frequency in this example) for different modulation formats (including 2ASK, 2PSK, and 16QAM).\n\n[0148]\n\nFIGS. 36 to 39 relate to the universal metasurface\n\nantenna 400 arranged for multi-channel wireless communi- cation. Specifically, FIG. 36 illustrates the shared aperture technique arranged to emit two independently modulated waves by the universal metasurface antenna, in which each sub-metasurface is responsible for one modulated waveform generation. FIG. 37 illustrates the synthesis process of the STC film for dual-channel wireless communications. Briefly, in this example, the bit stream for each sub-meta- surface is first mapped to the corresponding STC film according to the desired conversion harmonic frequency, polarization, and signal modulation format. The final STC film for dual-channel multiplexing is the sum of the two STC films for the two interwoven sub-metasurfaces. FIGS. 38 and 39 illustrate the measured radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna at the m=-1 (CH1) and m=-2 (CH2) harmonic frequencies. In FIGS. 38 and 39, the main beam directions of CH1 and CH2 are pointing to (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0) and (30\u00b0 and -30\u00b0) respectively. The insets on the right in FIGS. 38 and 39 illustrate the measured decoded constella-\n\ntion diagrams of the two channels at the receiver end. [0149] FIGS. 40 to 43 relate to the universal metasurface\n\nantenna 400 with the inherent direction modulation for the BPSK scheme. Specifically, FIG. 40 illustrates conceptually two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envelopes imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation at the fundamental frequency to generate two high-directivity beams with 180\u00b0 phase difference at the broadside direction for BPSK scheme. The space shift of the two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envel- ops is Ax=A/2. The inset in FIG. 40 shows the required STC matrixes for generating such spatial amplitude envelopes at the fundamental frequency. FIG. 41 shows the phase differ- ence between the two radiating cases as a function of the observation direction @. FIG. 42 illustrates conceptually the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for directly generating BPSK modulated waves at the fundamental fre- uency. In this example, only the target user at the main- beam direction can receive the correct phase variation (information), whereas eavesdroppers at off-angles decode garbled constellations. FIG. 43 shows the theoretical power pattern of the universal metasurface antenna and EVM as a\n\nfunction of the observation direction.\n\nFIGS. 44 to 47 relate to further results\n\n[0150] on physical- ayer security communications using the universal metasur- \u2018ace antenna 400. Specifically, FIGS. 44 and 45 show the measured radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna 400 and the measured decoded constellation dia- grams when the receiver is located in different directions. The main beam direction of the universal metasurface antenna 400 is scanned to 30\u00b0 (FIG. 44) and -30\u00b0 (FIG. 45), respectively. As illustrated, only the receiver in the main beam direction can successfully decode the information from the universal metasurface antenna 400.

In this respect, the universal metasurface antenna 400 includes multiple space-time-coding (STC) meta-atom arranged to facilitate (i) temporal modulation for producing nonlinear effects and (ii) simultaneous space-time modula- tions for converting newly generated waves into free space to mitigate the PMC (FIG. 4A). Specifically, the periodic switching of the radiation states of the meta-atoms may provide an infinite number of harmonic frequencies fo+mfAz where m is an integer. In one example, identical rectangular time sequences with position-dependent time shift t,(x) are\n\nof\n\napplied to\n\nthe\n\nmeta-atoms\n\n(FIG. 25). According to\n\nthe\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\ntime-shifting property of the Fourier Transform, a shift t, in\n\nthe time domain corresponds to a linear phase shift -2amf,A,; in the frequency domain. Therefore, the total phase shift of the radiated propagating wave (PW) includes two parts (FIG. 26): (i) the phase accumulation from the propagation of guided wave (GW) @\u00a2y=-E\u00a2 yx, (where Egy is the wavenumber inside the waveguide) and (ii) the abrupt phase shift induced by the spatiotemporal modulation \u4e2d sz=- 2nmf,A,(x). The corresponding linear momentum of the radiated propagating wave along the x direction is k.(fo+ mfy)-Eoytks;. where k,,=2nmf,, dt,(x)/ax is the addi- tional momentum imparted by the spatiotemporal modula- tion. In one example (FIG. 4A), this momentum is leveraged to compensate for the momentum mismatch between the waveguide and free space at the target m-+1 harmonic frequency, ie., -\u00a7,,-.1~Eew+ks7\u201c,,-41, where \u00a7,,,, is the free-space wavenumber at the m=+1 harmonic frequency. Other unwanted harmonics are not supported and are sup- pressed in both free space and the waveguide due to the significant momentum mismatch (FIG. 27). In this manner, a nearly perfect guided-wave-to-propagating-wave conver- sion and frequency shifting can be simultaneously achieved by the universal metasurface antenna 400. FIG. 5 shows the measured propagating wave spectra with different values of frequency shifting (from -1.8 MHz to +1.8 MHz, in the step\n\nof 0.6 MHz) by changing the modulation frequency fy,\n\n[0158] The universal metasurface antenna 400 also enable momentum control of EM waves. Suppose the applied time gradient ot,(x)/ox is a constant, the radiated propagating wave has a well-defined radiation angle @,=sin7'(kJ&,,,). Therefore, the momentum and the corresponding output angle of the radiated propagating wave can be readily tuned by changing the applied time gradient (FIG. 6).\n\n[0159]\n\nThe universal metasurface antenna 400 also phase control of EM waves. Since \u4e2d sz=-2rmtyT the initial phase of the extracted propagating wave can be tuned from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 by altering the reference time shift t,_, (the phase shift for the 1\u00b0 meta-atom) while fixing the time dt,(x)/ox (FIG. 7).\n\nenable\n\ngradient\n\n[0160] The universal metasurface antenna 400 also enable amplitude control of EM waves. The power distribution of the harmonic frequencies generally depends on the coding context of the time sequence. The amplitude of the extracted propagating wave can be tuned by varying the duty cycle t of the rectangular time sequence (FIG. 8).\n\nThe universal metasurface antenna 400 also enable\n\n[0161]\n\npolarization control of EM waves. In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 can generate arbitrary polarizations by applying independent STC matrixes to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to vary the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the extracted u- and v-polarized com- ponents. In one example, six representative polarizations (|x ) sly), td) 1). ILCP) (left-hand circular polarization), and IRCP) (right-hand circular polarization)) are provided as examples to show the polarization controllability (FIG. 9). The corresponding required STC matrixes are provided in FIGS. 51 and 52.\n\n[0162] The universal metasurface antenna 400 can also independently manipulate all of the properties of the radi- ated propagating wave without shifting the frequency. In one example, the time-average effect of the spatiotemporal modulation is leveraged to form an equivalent sinusoidal amplitude distribution at the fundamental frequency (FIGS. 28 to 33). In this manner, the n=-1 space harmonic becomes\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\na\n\nfast wave. It converts to propagating wave, the wave properties of which can be independently controlled by 1-bit space-time modulation (FIGS. 28 to 33). Further details related to this aspect will be provided below.\n\nthe\n\n[0163] The universal metasurface antenna 400 can simul- taneously control various properties of EM waves. To dem- onstrate this, the far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna 400 are obtained. In each of the plots in FIG. 10, three radiating cases with different magnitudes are given to demonstrate the independent amplitude con- trollability. The plots in the same row in FIG. 10 represent the radiated propagating waves with identical wave proper- ties but different linear momentums, whose corresponding beam angle steers from -40\u00b0, 0\u00b0 to +40\u00b0, which verify simultaneous amplitude and momentum controls. The polar-\n\nization is changed from |) in the plots in the first row to lu\n\n) in the plots in the second row, which enable simultaneous amplitude, momentum, and polarization controls. The out- put frequency is further changed from the fundamental frequency (m=0) in the plots in the second row to m-+1 harmonic frequency in the plots in the third row (with all other wave properties remain unchanged). Thus, this example verifies simultaneous amplitude, momentum, polarization, and frequency controls by the universal meta- surface antenna 400.\n\nEM-Wave Manipulations and Information Modulations\n\n[0164] The universal metasurface antenna 400 can gener- ate relatively complicated structured lights with space- and time-varying wave properties. In some examples, the meta- surface antenna 400 can achieve arbitrary beam shaping for beam and light focusing generations (FIGS. 11 and\n\nAiry\n\n14).\n\n[0165] In one example, the required spatial phase for Airy wavefront varies as (-x)*? (FIG. 12) for producing a para- bolic caustic xxz?. A spatial-dependent time shifting is introduced to the meta-atoms (FIG. 12) to form such a spatial-varying phase distribution at the m=-1 harmonic frequency. FIG. 13 presents the measured electric field intensity distributions at different harmonic frequencies. It can be seen that the universal metasurface antenna 400 can extract and mould the waves into an accelerating and non-diffractive Airy beam with a well-defined parabolic trajectory. Moreover, other undesired harmonic frequencies are highly suppressed in free space.\n\n[0166] In one example, the metasurface antenna 400 can also mould the extracted waves with spatial-varying momentum properties k,(x) for light-focusing applications (FIG. 14). This example considers the metasurface antenna steers the focal points from Fi to Fs at the m=\u20141 harmonic frequency. FIGS. 15 to 17 present the required space- dependent momentums, and the measured 1D and 2D elec- tric field intensity distributions for different focusing cases at the m=-1 harmonic frequency, respectively. It can be seen that the metasurface antenna 400 can extract and mould the propagating wave into intended focal spots, the positions of which are software-defined according to the applied STC matrix.\n\n[0167] beam\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible and shaping capability of the universal metasurface antenna 400, which may be particularly useful in sensing, and wireless power transfer applications.\n\nimaging,\n\nagile\n\nor\n\n[0168] The universal metasurface antenna 400 can enable facilitate information manipulation by generating time-\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nvarying wave properties (FIG. 18). By loading the animate\n\nSTC matrices (also referred to as \u201cSTC films\u201d), the universal metasurface antenna 400 can directly generate the modu- lated waveform with time-varying amplitude and phase properties, mapping to the desired digital information stream to be transmitted (FIG. 18). FIG. 18 also presents the measured decoded constellation diagrams and eye diagrams at the receiver end when the information is carried at the m=+1 and m=0 harmonic frequencies. The information manipulation functionality of the universal metasurface antenna 400 is validated for different information modula- tion schemes, including phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) (FIGS. 34 and 35), which demand the time-varying phase and the time-varying amplitude and phase properties, respectively. Existing trans- mitters typically rely on the heterodyne architecture con- sisting of a series of active/passive RF modules (including digital to analog converters, modulators, mixers, filters, phase shifters, and antenna arrays) to generate such modu- lated wayes in free space to mould the propagating waves with time-varying amplitude and phase (information-car- ried) properties. In contrast, the universal metasurface antenna 400, as a single assembly or device, can directly generate identical modulated waves in a single step. This provides a different communication paradigm in the physical layer with advantages of a simpler structure, higher integra-\n\ntion, lower cost, and/or lower power consumption.\n\n[0169] Moreover, the control over other properties of EM waves (momentum, frequency, and polarization) by the universal metasurface antenna 400 provides additional opportunities to achieve space-division multiplexing (SDM), frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), and polar- ization-division multiplexing (PDM), which can establish multiple independent channels to improve the communica- tions capacity.\n\n[0170] A combined SDM-FDM-PDM data transmission link is set up (FIGS. 19 and 49), in which the universal metasurface antenna 400 simultaneously transmits two inde- pendent channels with different beam directions (\u201430\u00b0 and\n\n+30\u00b0 for SDM), different polarizations (Iu) and |) for PDM), different frequencies (m=\u20141 and m=\u20142 harmonics\n\nfor FDM), and) different information modulation schemes (QPSK and 8PSK). To this end, a shared aperture approach is developed to enable the universal metasurface antenna 400 to achieve such complicated wave and information manipulations (FIGS. 36 to 39). The measured far-field radiation patterns (FIG. 20) and the decoded constellation diagrams at the receiver (right inset of FIG. 20) verify that the universal metasurface antenna 400 can realize simulta- neous and independent multiplexing.\n\n[0171] In conventional transmitter architectures, the radi- ated EM waves in different directions hold identical time- varying wave properties (information). Therefore, an eaves- dropper can recover the information even in the sidelobe region by using a sufficiently sensitive receiver (FIGS. 46 and 47). In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 can provide an inherent directional modulation (IDM) phenomenon at the fundamental frequency. This unique IDM property is attributed to the direction-dependent phase control of the universal metasurface antenna 400 (FIGS. 40 to 43). For validation, a communication link is established, through which the universal metasurface antenna 400 directly emits the modulated waves carrying the 8PSK signals at the fundamental frequency (FIG. 21). FIG. 22\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\npresents the corresponding measured radiation patterns and the decoded constellation diagrams when the receiver is located in different directions. It can be seen that the receiver can only successfully decode the information in the main- beam direction of the universal metasurface antenna (the information is completely lost outside the main beam). This IDM effect may be used to effectively mitigate malicious eavesdropper attacks in different directions, establishing physical-layer security on top of wireless communications. The IDM is an intrinsic property of the universal metasur- face antenna 400 and is free of any optimization and performance trade-off generally incurred for conventional approaches to achieve physically secure communication links.\n\nWave Manipulations with Frequency Shifting\n\n[0172] In this example, the theoretical model of the wave- guide-integrated metasurface antenna is extended to a more generalized one by taking polarization into account. In this example, the metasurface is represented or described by an array of subwavelength scatterers with the discrete nature of the metasurface. The universal metasurface antenna 400 includes an array of slot opening based meta-atoms etched on the top conductive layer of the substrate integrated waveguide along the x-axis (FIG. 23). In this example, the anisotropic slot opening meta-atom is equivalent to two orthogonally orientated waveguide-fed magnetic dipoles to extract energy from the waveguide and radiate to free space.\n\nThe wave properties of the extracted Iu) and IW compo- nents can be independently controlled by applying indepen- dent control voltages to the PIN diodes incorporated in the meta-atom (FIG. 24). The excited polarized magnetic dipole moments m,=[m,\u201cm,\"] with ly) and IW components for the i\u201d meta-atom at the position x, is\n\n\u5143 B Hoe Ha effort 0) 5 [Po where P; = [ PHO)\n\nis the magnetic polarizability Jones matrix at instant t, and H,; is the magnetic field of the reference guided wave inside the waveguide. Since the radiating state of the meta-atom is periodically switched ON and OFF with a time cycle T,,, the magnetic polarizability is a periodic function of time, sat- isfying P,(t)}=P,(t+T,,), which can be decomposed into a Fourier series\n\nP= DP _PygePente \u5716\n\nwhere f,,=1/T,, is the modulation frequency. The Fourier coefficients\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\ncan be calculated by\n\n= 1 - Tyg = 3 Pim = f De Pals at 3 mT Jo\n\n[0173] Equation (2) can be substituted into equation (1)\n\nyield:\n\n= Hoy\u201d eMlormhaltp, Kove 4\n\niy\n\nFrom equation (4), it can be determined that the periodic ON-OFF switching of the meta-atom can generate an infinite number of harmonic frequencies with a frequency interval fr This nonlinear effect opens the opportunity to control the frequency property of EM waves. Moreover, the spatiotem- poral modulation introduces equivalent magnetic polariz- ability Pim(fotmfy,) at the m\u201d-order harmonic frequency, providing additional degrees of freedom to control the other properties of EM waves. Once the excited magnetic polar- izability of each meta-atom is known, the radiation pattern of the universal metasurface antenna 400 in free space can be obtained.\n\n[0174] In one example, generally identical rectangular time sequences are applied (FIG. 25 with At=0) to meta-atoms. The corresponding magnetic polarizability can expressed as\n\nbe\n\n\u201c7/2 s 1/Ty s7/2 \u00a9 ever others P= a\n\nwhere P, is the constant magnetic polarizability as the meta-atom is in the radiating state.\n\nis the duty cycle for the Iu) and Iv) components, which is defined as the ratio of the time a meta-atom is in the coupling state (\u201c1\u201d) over a modulation time cycle. By substituting equation (5) into equation (3), the equivalent magnetic polarizability Dim for the i\u201d meta-atom at the mw%-order harmonic frequency is\n\nHye = Potsine{ami) \u00a9\n\n[0175] From equation (6), the amplitude of the magnetic polarizability at each harmonic is a function of the employed duty cycle T,. To further enable phase control, a time delay\n\nis introduced for the meta-atom (FIG. 25), and the equiva- lent magnetic polarizability Pim becomes\n\nto\n\nall\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nM Pin = Prince\n\n[0176] Comparing equations (6) and (7), an additional phase term @,7=\u2014j2mmf,/l, depending on the applied time delay 1,, is introduced to the equivalent magnetic polariz- ability at the m\u201c-order harmonic frequency (FIG. 26). In this manner, the amplitude and phase of the excited magnetic polarizability can be decoupled and controlled indepen- dently.\n\n[0177] Arbitrary polarizations can be decomposed into linear combination of two complete orthogonal polarization\n\nbases, e.g., lt) and lv) and vice versa. In this example, the anisotropic meta-atom includes a pair of 45\u00b0-inclined ellip- tical slot openings with a large length-to-width ratio, and the associated radiated electric field polarization is perpendicu- lar to the long side (FIG. 23). Applying independent STC matrixes to the +45\u00b0-inclined slots in each meta-atom allows independent control over the amplitude and phase contents\n\nof\n\nthe extracted ly) and IW components, resulting in arbi- trary polarization generation by the universal metasurface antenna 400. Specifically, an identical time gradient 3t,(x)/ 8x is adopted for both the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings such\n\nthat the lu) and IW components share the same momentum and output direction. Different initial time delays and duty cycles may be applied to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to control the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the radiated I) and IW components, respectively. The univer- sal metasurface antenna 400 is loaded with different STC matrixes (FIG. 51) to generate six representative polariza- tions, which includes Ix) , ly) , I) , I), ILCP , and IRCP\n\n) (FIG. 9).\n\nfurther details\n\ntheoretical\n\n[0178] For completeness, on the radiation pattern of the universal metasurface antenna 400 is provided.\n\n[0179] In one example, the discrete dipole approach is used to calculate the far-field radiation pattern of the uni- versal metasurface antenna 400. In this example, the mag- netic dipole moment is used as the weight coefficient in array factor calculation. In this example, each meta-atom can be viewed as two +45\u00b0-inclined magnetic dipoles, whose radi- ating far-field can be expressed as\n\n_ 2 (sb HO) =\u2014 \u4e0b wow\n\nwhere 6 is the observation direction with respect to the surface normal of the metasurface. The pattern of the meta-atom is modeled as a cosine function cos 8. By substituting equations (4) and (7) into (SL), the following can be obtained:\n\n$2) BHfoPo Se selmi f+ fig?

Since different values of momentum K,,, are introduced to different harmonic frequen- cies, the space-time sequence can be designed such that only the harmonic frequency of interest fulfils the momentum- matching condition in free space. In one example, the beam directions of other unwanted harmonics are out of the visible region, hence these harmonics do not contribute to radiation in free space. FIG. 50 shows the theoretical and measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface for m=+1 harmonic up conyersion. The theoretical and mea- sured far-field radiation patterns are similar. This validates the effectiveness of the developed approach for far-field radiation pattern calculation.\n\n[0180] For completeness, further details on the derivation equation (6) is also provided.\n\nof\n\n[0181] The equivalent magnetic polarizability Piw for the meta-atom at the m\u2122 harmonic frequency in equation (6) are derived as follows:\n\ni\u201d\n\n= 1 Pim = Fe fe Pade PM dt ($6) 0 1 2 \u4eba = \u865f \u4e00 = @ Pam de \"Ty -2\n\nas\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\n15\n\n-continued \u4e86 \u4eba | 2 1 ryt, = Po oT, \u5230 = Potysine( rm)\n\nWave Manipulations without Frequency Shifting\n\n[0182] For wave manipulations at the fundamental fre- quency (m=0), the equivalent magnetic polarizability due to spatiotemporal modulations in equation (3) can be simplified as\n\n= 1 fw (8) Pim-0 = \u5143 Pde y Tre Jo\n\n[0183] It can be determined that the equivalent magnetic polarizability at the fundamental frequency is the time- average magnetic polarizability for one modulation cycle. Specifically, when generally rectangular time sequences are adopted, the equivalent magnetic polarizability at the fun- damental frequency in equation (7) can be simplified as Pim-o=Pot,. The spatiotemporal modulation generates an equivalent amplitude of the magnetic polarizability without introducing phase shifts or momentum for the fundamental frequency. In one example, to facilitate guided-wave-to- propagating-wave transformation at the fundamental fre- quency, the equivalent magnetic polarizability is leveraged to form a sinusoidal amplitude modulation along the length of the waveguide such that the n=\u2014l space harmonic becomes fast and radiates into free space (FIG. 28)\n\nFa) = aft 4+ Hf cos (\u5230 \u00ae \u7ad9 \u4e8c _ [4 where M = bea\n\nare the modulation depths for the |) and Ix) components, and A is the spatial period of the sinusoidal amplitude envelope. The radiation of the equivalent magnetic dipole can be viewed as spatially sampling the reference guided wave at each meta-atom position.\n\n[0184] In one example, the momentum of the n=\u20141 space harmonic along the x direction is k,=\u20ac,,,-2n/A, which matches that of the free space providing that \u20141<k/&,<1. The corresponding output angle of the n=\u2014-1 space harmonic\n\nis\n\n6, = sin af oo \u201420/A & Sf\n\nFurthermore, to suppress the higher-order harmonic fre- quencies, the applied time delays and the time sequence randomized while the equivalent sinusoidal modulation the meta-atoms is maintained (FIG. 29). Since the momen- tums of the higher-order harmonic frequencies do not match with that of the free space and waveguide, the undesired higher-order harmonic frequencies (m#0) are significantly\n\nis\n\nto\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nsuppressed. The momentum and the corresponding output angle of the extracted propagating wave can be tuned by changing the spatial period A through changing the applied STC matrix (FIG. 31). The space-shifting property of the Fourier Transform can be utilized to control the phase of the extracted propagating wave. In analogy with the time- shifting property but in the space domain, a shift Ax in the space domain can result in a phase shift 2tnAx/A for the n\u201c-order space harmonic. In one example, different space shifts Ax are applied to the sinusoidal amplitude envelope, resulting in different phases to the radiated n=\u20141 space harmonic (FIG. 32). In one example, the extracted power for each meta-atom from the waveguide is proportional to the modulation efficiency of the sinusoidal amplitude modula- tion\n\n=.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the extracted propagating wave of our universal metasurface antenna can be tuned by changing the modulation depth M (FIG. 33). In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 can gener- ate arbitrary polarization by controlling the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the extracted Iu) and IW compo- nents. To this end, equivalent sinusoidal amplitude distribu- tions with an identical spatial period A can be applied to both the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings such that the extracted lu ) and IW components share the same output angle in free space. Different space translations and modulation depths are applied to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to control the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the I) and ly ) components, respectively. As an example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 is loaded with different STC matrixes (FIG. 52) to generate six representative polariza- tions: IX), ly}. ) , I), ILCB , and IRCP (FIG. 30).\n\nAiry Beam Generation\n\n[0185] For collimated propagating wave generation, the extracted waves from all meta-atoms are radiated at an identical output angle, thereby possessing a progressive phase distribution along the x direction. In one example, the metasurface antenna 400 can generate the EM waves with more complicated spatial-varying phase properties for Airy beam. The required phase profile along the metasurface antenna 400 should fulfill the following equation to generate a parabolic trajectory under the ray optics and paraxial approximation:\n\ntx) = fats (x? ao\n\nwhere a is the acceleration factor and &,, is the free-space wavenumber at the target mw%-order harmonic frequency. The corresponding theoretical trajectory is a parabolic caus- tic with x=az*. For the universal metasurface antenna 400, the phase distribution of the extracted wave at the m%-order harmonic frequency is the sum of the accumulated phase\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nshift of the guided wave and the equivalent phase shift imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation, given by \u4e2d cv Os7=\u2014G ow X- 20m yt (x) (FIG. 26).

The corresponding 1D and 2D field intensities distributions at the m=\u20141 harmonic frequency are presented in FIGS. 16 and 17.\n\nShared Aperture Metasurface for Multi-Channel Communications\n\n[0187] In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 can be divided into two interwoven sub-metasurfaces (FIG. 36). Each sub-metasurface, loaded with an indepen- dent STC film, generates one specific modulated waveform, corresponding to one communication channel. In one example, the lattice of meta-atoms in the sub-metasurface is 0.314,(where 1, is the free-space wavelength at 23.5 GHz). The sub-metasurface is free of higher-order diffractions in the free space (FIG. 21). The resultant universal metasurface antenna 400 can be considered as a combination of the two interwoven sub-metasurfaces, which share the same radiat- ing aperture above the waveguide to generate two indepen- dent modulated channels. In one example, two different time gradients are applied to the two sub-metasurfaces, and the equivalent momentums imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation push the m=\u20141 and m=\u20142 harmonic frequencies to radiate into the free space with output angles of \u201430\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 for the two sub-metasurfaces, respectively. The ampli- tude and phase contents (carried information) of the two\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nextracted propagating waves can be independently con- trolled by the applied duty cycle and reference time shift according to the transmitted binary bit streams of the two channels. The polarization states of the two radiated beams can be controlled by applying different space-time coding sequences to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings in each sub- metasurface.\n\n[0188]\n\nFIG. 37 shows an example synthesis process of the\n\nSTC film to support dual-channel SDM-FDM-PDM data transmission links. In this example, the bit stream for each sub-metasurface is mapped to the corresponding STC film according to the desired conversion harmonic frequency, polarization, and signal modulation format. The final STC film for dual-channel multiplexing is the sum of the two STC films for the two interwoven sub-metasurfaces. Following the same shared aperture technology, the radiation directions of CH1 and CH2 are further manipulated to (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0) and (30\u00b0 and \u201430\u00b0) respectively. This can be achieved by chang- ing the applied time gradients to the two sub-metasurfaces to vary the momentum property of the extracted propagating waves. The measured radiation patterns (FIGS. 38 and 39) and the measured decoded constellation diagrams of the two channels at the receiver end (right inset of FIGS. 38 and 39) have verified the SDM-FDM-PDM data transmission links. Based on the above, it can be seen that the shared aperture technique can combine the functionalities of multiple sub- metasurfaces into one aperture, thereby expanding the wave and information manipulation capabilities of the universal\n\nmetasurface antenna 400.\n\nInherent Directional Modulation\n\n[0189] The direction-dependent phase property at the fun- damental frequency can be elucidated from the perspective of spatial Fourier transform. The aperture field distribution of the metasurface and its spatial frequency spectrum (far- field radiation pattern in free space) F(9) fulfills the Fourier transform relationship\n\n00e = rg),\n\nwhere A(x) is the equivalent spatial amplitude envelope in equation (9) imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation. In one example, a space translation Ax is introduced to the spatial amplitude envelope (FIG. 40). The aperture field distribution becomes A(x\u2014Ax)e~*\", and the associated far-field radiation pattern is\n\nFO) = 6 Mew 0 py (4)\n\nFrom equation (14), it can be seen that a space translation Ax of the amplitude envelope introduces an additional phase shift Ao(8)=-&,,,-G sin 8)Ax to the phase pattern without affecting the power pattern of the universal metasurface antenna. Moreover, the introduced phase shift AO is a function of the observation direction 8, meaning that differ- ent directions possess different phase shifts for a fixed space translation Ax of the amplitude envelope. In one particular example (as a special case), the phase shift in the main beam direction 6, is\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nQn Ad(G,) = \u4e00 qo\n\nconsidering the main beam direction is\n\n\u201c(= 4) 6, = siv \u603b\n\n[0190] used\n\nas\n\nFor illustration, the BPSK modulation scheme is example to show the directional information\n\nan\n\nmodulation of the universal metasurface antenna 400. FIG. 40 shows the two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envelopes in this example, which are arranged to generate high- directivity beams with the same amplitude and 180\u00b0 phase difference at the broadside direction (8,=0\u00b0), mapping to the digital information \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d, respectively. To this end, the two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude enyelopes share an identical spatial period A yet with a space shift Ax=A/2. The phase difference between the two radiating cases as a function of the observation direction 9 is presented in FIG. 41 based on equation (12). It can be seen that a desired 180\u00b0 phase difference is generated at the main beam direction (broadside in this example) while deviating significantly for off-broadside directions. To directly generate BPSK modu- lated waveform, the animate STC matrixes (STC film) are applied to the universal metasurface antenna 400 according to the desired transmitted \u201c0/1\u201d digital stream (FIG. 42). FIG. 43 further shows the theoretical radiation power pattern of the universal metasurface antenna (also see related deri- vation under \u201cWave Manipulations with Frequency Shift- ing\u201d) and the calculated error vector magnitude (EVM) at different observation directions in a noiseless environment. can be seen that eavesdroppers receive a much weaker power at off-main-beam directions. Also, unlike the target user (receiver), off-angle eavesdroppers would sense incor- rect phase variation (information) in the main beam direc- tion, leading to corrupted constellations. It is envisaged that the inherent direction modulation property of the universal metasurface antenna 400 can be applied to other higher-\n\nIt\n\norder modulation formats, such as 8PSK and QAM, as well.\n\n[0191] For completeness, further details on the derivation of equation (14) is also provided.\n\n[0192] The aperture field distribution E(x) and its spatial frequency spectrum (i.e., far-field radiation pattern in free space) F(9) is a Fourier transform pair\n\nE@ = Awe So Sr) (7\n\nwhere A(x) is the equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envelope imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation at the funda- mental frequency. According to the space-shifting property of the Fourier Transform, an analogy to the time-shifting property but in the space domain, the following can be obtained:\n\nee (S8)\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\n[0193] Then, a space shift Ax is introduced to the spatial amplitude envelope. The aperture field of the metasurface antenna becomes E'(x)=A(x\u2014Ax)e7*\"\"\", Note that the spatial shift of the amplitude envelope does not affect the phase of the propagating guided wave ee Combining with equa- tion (S8), then:\n\n\u5c40 CD = Ale Axje en g- Hewds FL pr egy = o-HGen-form Hx egy 69\n\ncan be seen from equation (S9) that a space translation the amplitude envelope introduces a direction-dependent phase shift Ao(8)=\u2014(E,,,\u2014\u00a7) sin 8)Ax to the radiation pattern.\n\nIt in\n\nPrototype\n\n[0194]\n\nFIG. 4B shows the configurations of the anisotro-\n\npic meta-atom of the metasurface antenna 400. In this example, to facilitate integration with other components, the substrate integrated waveguide as the wave-guiding struc- ture, which uses multiple parallel rows of metallic via holes and a thin dielectric substrate to realize the generally rect- angular and planar waveguide. Two +45\u00b0 inclined elliptical slot openings are etched on the top metallic surface of the substrate integrated waveguide. The lattice size of the unit cell along the x-direction is 2 mm, corresponding to 0.158Ap. Each slot opening operates as a polarizable magnetic dipole, of which the extracted electric field polarization is perpen- dicular to the long side of the slot. The slot meta-atom is designed to be at an off-resonance state by tuning the geometric parameters of the slot opening. Four PIN diodes (MACOMMADP-000907-14020x) are placed across the capacitive gaps of the slot openings in each meta-atom. A DC bias circuit is integrated into the meta-atom design. The circuit includes a fan-shaped bias line (for RF choking) on the bottom biasing circuitry and a control via connecting the top meta-atom to the bottom biasing circuitry. In this example, the vias fences in the substrate integrated wave- guide are utilized as the control vias to alleviate the pertur- bation of the bias network on the guided wave. The two PIN diodes in the same slot opening are biased in the same state, while the PIN diodes in different inclined slot openings are biased and controlled independently. In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 includes 41 meta-atoms with 164 PIN diodes. In this example, a FPGA control board (ALTERA Cyclone [V) can be operably coupled with the universal metasurface antenna 400 for controlling its opera- tion. The FPGA control board is arranged to generate 82 independent control signals (two independent control sig- nals for each anisotropic meta-atom) to control the ON-OFF states of the PIN diodes and the radiating states of the\n\nmeta-atoms.\n\n[0195] The radiation characteristics of the meta-atom are modeled and simulated using the commercially available ANSYS HFSS numerical simulator based on the finite element method. The PIN diode was modeled as a series of resistance R=8Q and inductance L=30 pH for forward biased (State \u201c0\u201d), and a series of capacitance C=0.052 pF and inductance L=30 pH for non-bias (State \u201c1\u201d), respec- tively. Wave ports are adopted to excite the fundamental TE, mode of the substrate integrated waveguide.\n\n[0196] As an example, the universal metasurface antenna is fabricated by using commercial multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) technology. Two 1.575 and 0.787 mm-\n\n400\n\nAx\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nthick\n\n5880 substrates for the substrate\n\nRogers integrated waveguide and bias circuitry are bonded by a thin Rogers 4450F film. The total 164 PIN diodes are then mounted on the gaps of the slot openings through reflow soldering. The radiation pattern of the universal metasurface antenna is measured in a microwave anechoic chamber using a recon- figurable robotic measurement system (FIGS. 48A and 48B). In one example, a signal generator (Agilent E8267D) launches monochromatic waves at 23.5 GHz to feed the universal metasurface antenna; a horn antenna is connected to a vector network analyzer (VNA, Keysight N9041B) to detect the radiated EM waves from the metasurface. The robotic arm holds the linearly polarized horn antenna, which can rotate along a user-defined circular path from \u201490\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 to measure the radiation pattern of the universal meta- surface antenna 400. Different polarization components of the EM waves can be measured by physically rotating the\n\nlinearly polarized horn antenna.\n\n[0197]\n\nAn indoor wireless communication experiment is\n\nperformed to illustrate the information manipulations of our universal metasurface antenna (FIG. 49). In this example. for the transmitter side, a microwave signal generator (Agi- lent E8267D) is adopted to generate a monochromatic wave with a frequency f,=23.5 GHz to feed the universal meta- surface antenna 400. The modulated waves with temporal- variant amplitude and phase properties (information) are directly generated and launched into free space by the universal metasurface antenna 400. Random binary bit streams with different modulation formats (QPSK, 8PSK, and 16QAM) are generated and mapped to the correspond- ing STC films in FPGA. For the receiver side, a linearly polarized diagonal horn antenna connected to a vector signal analyzer (VSA, Keysight N9041B) is adopted to receive and demodulate the propagating wave from the universal meta- surface antenna 400. The received digital messages can be recovered by the VSA, which provides the performance of the real-time constellation diagram, eye diagram, signal noise ratio (SNR), and EVM. In this example, the distance between the universal metasurface antenna and the received horn antenna is about 1.2 m. The modulation frequency fy, is set as 0.5 MHz, and the switching speed of the PIN diodes is 10 MHz. For the multiplexing wireless communication experiment, the universal metasurface antenna 400 gener- two channels in different directions\n\nates\n\nindependent\n\n(FIG.\n\n49). At the receiver side, two horn antennas with h) and lu\n\n)\n\npolarizations are located at the two main beam directions, respectively.

In this embodiment, the metasurface antenna 400 is operable at microwave frequen- cies and utilize positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes as the active element. In this embodiment, the metasurface antenna 400 includes an array of subwavelength meta-atoms on top of a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW). Each meta-atom includes two +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to\n\nradiate\n\ntwo orthogonal eigen-polarization states ly)\n\n(+45\u00b0\n\nlinear polarization) and |v) (\u201445\u00b0 linear polarization) in free space. Each slot opening can be independently switched between the radiating (\u201c1\u201d) and non-radiating (\u201c0\u201d) states in real time by the PIN diode. In this embodiment, the radiating state of the meta-atom is temporally modulated with a time cycle T,=1/f, and the frequency of the injected monochro- matic wave is {,, subject to {,>>f,,. In this embodiment, independent time-coding sequences applied to all meta- atoms forms a two-dimensional (2D) \u201c0/1\u201d space-time- coding (STC) matrix, which is controlled by a field pro- grammable gate array (FPGA). Our STC metasurface antenna enables extracting and converting the in-plane guided wave (GW) into the out-of-plane propagating wave (PW) with arbitrary wave properties.\n\n[0200] As the skilled person appreciates, the invention limited to the universal metasurface antenna 400 embodiment.\n\nnot\n\nis\n\n[0201] More generally, some embodiments of the inven- tion provide a universal metasurface antenna with a meta- surface structure (which has multiple subwavelength units) that can control one or more or all of the fundamental properties (including amplitude, phase, polarization, fre- quency, and momentum) of electromagnetic waves for radiation. Some embodiments of the invention provide a universal metasurface that is a waveguide-fed spatiotempo- rally modulated metasurface capable of extracting and modulating guided waves into desired out-of-plane free- space waves. Some embodiments of the invention incorpo- rate positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes into each meta- atom of the metasurface or metasurface antenna to switch the element between the coupling (\u201c1\u201d) and non-coupling (\u201c0\u201d) states. In some embodiments, the coupling state of the meta-atoms can be dynamically controlled by a controller, e.g., a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), in a pre- designed time sequence.

In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna further facilitates the spatial- and time-varying wave properties, which enable generation of more complicated. waveform, beamforming, direct information manipulations, etc. In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna can generate non-diffractive Airy and near-field focusing beams. In some embodiments, the universal meta- surface antenna can directly generate the modulated waves carrying information that can fundamentally simplify the architecture of information transmitter systems.

Some embodiments of the invention may have one or more additional or alternative functions and/or applications not described or illustrated. For example, some embodi- ments of the metasurface antenna can dynamically, simul- taneously, independently, and precisely manipulate all of the fundamental properties of EM waves, including amplitude, phase, momentum, frequency, and polarization. For example, some embodiments of the metasurface antenna can facilitate information manipulations by directly generating the modulated waveforms with animate wave properties, which may lead to a paradigm shift for new information- transmitting architectures. For example, some embodiments of the metasurface antenna can enable control of angular momentum (e.g., for the 2D case). For example, some embodiments of the metasurface antenna can include one or more of the following merits, including full-dimensional wave controllability, inherent information directional modu- lation, simplified coding scheme (e.g., 1 bit), free of side- band pollution, and potential on-chip integration, making the metasurface antenna an appealing enabler for applica- tions in the next-generation large-capacity and high-security\n\ninformation systems, cognitive sensing, imaging, etc.\n\n[0203] Some embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following example advantages. Some embodiments of the invention may include one or more additional or alternative advantages not described or illus- trated. For example, some embodiments may provide a single metasurface device that can manipulate multiple (e.g., all) fundamental properties of EM waves (amplitude, phase, momentum, frequency, and polarization). For example, some embodiments alleviate or overcome one or more of these issues: (i) the functionalities of existing passive meta- surfaces cannot be altered once fabricated, (ii) existing tunable metasurfaces lack sufficient degrees of freedom in the element\u2019s geometrical parameters and lack external control variables that can support the regulation of all wave properties, and (iii) independent EM wave properties manipulations are challenging as the controls over these properties are generally coupled with each other.

Some embodiments of the invention realize complicated and complete waveform controls by simply switching the opera- tion states of the meta-atoms (radiating and non-radiating; ON and OFF) (e.g., 1 bit).\n\n[0204]\n\nIt will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art\n\nthat variations and/or modifications may be made to the described and/or illustrated embodiments of the invention to provide other embodiments of the invention.

Some embodiments of the invention may include one or more of these optional features (some of which are not specifically illustrated in the drawings). Some embodiments of the invention may lack one or more of these optional features (some of which are not specifically illus- trated in the drawings). In some embodiments, the construc- tion of the device may be different from those illustrated. For example, the metasurface structure and/or related antenna and antenna system can be of different shapes, sizes, forms, etc. than those illustrated.

It should be noted that in embodiments in which the metasur- face structure includes subwavelength units that can operate (operable) to manipulate or control all five of the funda- mental EM wave properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum), the metasurface structure need not always operate to manipulate or control all five proper- ties at the same time; instead the metasurface structure can manipulate or control any one or more or all of them at the same time (i.e., the metasurface structure has the ability to manipulate or control all five properties but it can be\n\narranged to manipulate or control any one or more (up to all five) of them in operation).\n\n1.
