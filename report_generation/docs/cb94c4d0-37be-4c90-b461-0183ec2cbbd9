The system 300 also includes a monitor device 312, e.g., a camera, for monitoring the processing status of the optical fiber, e.g., the shape of the optical tip during processing. A controller 314 is operably connected with the monitor device 312, the driving sources 306 and the laser source 308, to control the processing of the optical fiber 100\u00b0. The control- ler 314 may include a processor and a memory.

For example, the controller may control the power of the laser source, the movement of the clamps 304 (which affect tension of the optical fiber 100\") based on the status of the tip detected by the monitor device 312.

The optical fiber 100 includes an elongated body 102 with a tip 102T. In this embodiment, the tip 102T is a nano-tip sized in nano-scale. The optical fiber 100 has a core 104 and a cladding 106 arranged around the core 104, as shown in FIG. 1B. A metallic arrangement, in the form of metallic layers 108 made with a material that has a low work function, is arranged at the tip 102T. The optical fiber 100 has an open end at which the metallic arrangement is arranged to allow the metallic arrangement to be excited by an energy source. The metallic arrangement can be made from chromium (Cr), gold (Au), or tungsten (W). The metallic layers 108 are arranged to be excited by an energy source (not shown) to emit electrons or electron beams from its surface. The energy source may be a pulsed laser source that transmits laser pulses through the optical fiber 100 (e.g., at the other end away from the tip 102T) to generate pulses of electron beams at the end of the tip 102T.\n\n[0025] FIG. 4 illustrates excitation of electrons in a metal- lic arrangement of a device for providing electrons, such as the device 100 in FIG. 1. In FIG. 4, the x-axis represents the distance of electrons from the surface of the metallic arrangement (at the tip of the device) and the y-axis repre- sents the material energy barrier. Note that the device may already have been placed in an appropriate electric field that reduces the barrier. The graph in FIG. 4 shows three lines, each representing a different material M1, M2, M3 for the metallic arrangement. The material energy barrier with 0 eV represents the Fermi level. When femtosecond laser pulses are provided to the device hence the metallic arrangement, the laser excites the electrons to a high- (or higher-) energy level, sufficient for the electrons to overcome the energy barrier escape from the metallic arrangement.\n\n[0023] A method 200 for producing a device for providing electrons in one embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 2. The device may be the device 100 in FIGS. 1A and 1B. The method 200 includes, first, in step 202, forming an optical fiber with a tip and then, in step 204, arranging a metallic arrangement at the tip. In step 202, forming the optical fiber with a tip may include melting a portion of the optical fiber to form the tip, e.g., using laser. The optical fiber may be tensioned during the melting. The tension applied may be generally increased as the portion melts. In step 204, arranging a metallic arrangement at the tip may include applying one or more metallic coatings to the tip. The coating may be performed using electron beam evapo- ration or pulsed laser deposition.\n\n[0026] FIG. 5 a microscope 500 incorporating the device 100 of FIG. 1. The transmis- sion electron microscope 500 is the same as existing ones (having, among others, condenser lens 502, specimen 504, objective lens 506, projection lens 508, and image plane 510), except that the electron source includes the device 100 of FIG. 1 (only tip shown, for simplicity) and a pulsed laser source 50 operably connected to the device 100. The device 100 may be placed in an electric field that assist generation of electrons or electron beams from the tip. The electron source with the pulsed laser source 50 and the device 100 may be arranged, like the other components of the micro- scope 500, in a vacuum environment. In this embodiment, the laser source injects laser beams or pulses into ultra-high vacuum through ultra-high vacuum (e.g., 107'\u00b0 torr) fiber feedthrough and then transmitted from one end of the fiber to the tip of the fiber 100. The laser beams or pulses arriving at the tip excite the electrons, allowing the electrons to be excited to leave the metallic layers, in the form of electron beam pulses. In one application, when femtosecond pulsed laser is used to excite the electrons at the metallic arrange- ment, an ultrafast pulse electron source can be produced. In general, there are two ways to increase electron or electron eam emission: (1) use pulsed laser with shorter wavelength as they can excite electrons to a higher energy level; and (2) use material with low work function to reduce the energy barrier. The energy source in this example essentially acts as field emission electron gun, a high brightness electron\n\n[0024] FIG. 3 shows a system 300 for producing a device 100 for providing electrons in one embodiment of the invention. The system 300 is used to create an optical fiber 100' with a tip, e.g., like the one in FIG. 1. The tip created may be in nano-scale. In one example, the tip may have a tip radius of smaller than 100 nm. The system 300 includes a pair of clamps 302 for clamping an optical fiber (to be processed to produce a tip). The clamps 302 are mounted on respective movable platforms 304 that can be selectively moved towards and away from each other to adjust a tensioning of the clamped optical fiber 100\u2019. The platforms 302 are each connected with a respective driving source (e.g., motor) 306 to affect its movement. The system includes an energy source, e.g., laser source 308 (with a CO, laser cavity) arranged to provide laser energy for melting a\n\nfor the\n\nTHE\n\ntopography\n\naccurately\n\nshows\n\ntransmission electron\n\na\n\nsource with high spatial and temporal resolution.
