The invention employs the superelasticity or pseudoelasticity, such as found in a nickel-titanium alloy, to provide a continuous, predictable, and controllable correction force and to achieve a gradual and full correction. The cor- rection force can be exerted on the deformed spine either at the time of the spine surgery or after the surgery or both, to afford a full or substantially full correction. The continuous and controllable correction force of the present invention is safer than an instantaneous and large correction force applied only at the time of surgery. Additionally, the continuous and controllable correction force is capable of gradually and fully correcting the spinal deformities without any post-operative manipulation of the correction device or re-operation.\n\n(60) Provisional application No. 60/406,019, filed on Aug. 25, 2002.\n\n(51) Int.

For example, conventional spinal correction systems, from the earlier Harrington, Jacobs and Luque systems to the later leveloped systems such as TSRH (SOFAMOR DANEK, US), CD Horizons (SOFAMOR DANEK, US) and ISOLA (DePuyAcroMed, Raynbam, Mass., US) and Moss Miami (DePuy AcroMed), use slightly different techniques to cor- rect scoliosis. Such correction systems can reduce spinal deformity by only 60% to 70%, but a full correction is almost impossible. The use of excessive correction forces in attempt- ing a full correction can cause bony fractures or neurological deficit due to spinal cord damage.\n\nThe present invention generally relates to a device for and method of correcting spinal deformities. In particular, the present invention relates a device for and a method of gradu- ally correcting spinal deformities.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nVarious correction systems have been used to correct spinal deformities. For example, the Harrington system, introduce: in the early 1950s, employs a distraction rod on the concave side of the deformed spine. The use of the Harrington system and spinal fusion in treating idiopathic scoliosis was found useful for both single and double thoracic contours. However, a loss of lumbar lordosis, or the \u201cflatback\u201d effect, can occur when using the Harrington system along with distraction over the lumbar spine. This effect could be countered by segmental wiring (e.g., sublaminar wiring or wiring of the spinous pro- cess) over the instrumented site to retain the lumbar lordosis. Nevertheless, the Harrington system can have limited contro of sagittal plane correction, limited derotation, and high rate of hook dislodgment in the lumbar spine, encounter distrac- tion rod fracture, and require postoperative external support.\n\ntakes into account the viscoelastic behavior of the spine. Viscoelastic properties of the spine relate to its time depen- lent mechanical effect, i.e., the stiffness of spine decreases over the duration for which the force is applied. Such mechanical effect has been observed in spinal surgery, where the force required to hold tissue in tension decreases gradu- ally during the operation. The correction force applied by the correction system will also decrease as the tissues relax. This loss of tension within the correction systems can cause a partial recurrence of deformity subsequent to the correction. Consequently, conventional correction systems can cause a loss of correction for up to 15% as a result of this effect. Furthermore, because scoliosis correction is carried out instantaneously and only at the time of surgery with no time for the tissues to relax, the load on the spine rises rapidly. The increased load on the corrected spine limits the amount of correction force that is safely possible. Thus, viscoelastic behavior of spinal tissues can limit the amount of correction force and in turn the correction rate. If excessive correction forces are used, they can cause bony fractures. In addition, neurological deficit can occur due to rapid over-stretching of\n\nThe Luque system employs a spinal implant for scoliosis correction. The use of the spinal implant involves both convex technique and concave technique. The convex technique is usually used to treat patients with thoracic curve, whereas the concave technique is used on patients with lumbar curve or severe deformity. The Luque system uses sublaminar wiring as multiple segmental fixation points with attachment to a rod. and the L-shaped Luque rod. The sublaminar wiring provides fixation at various points along the instrumented area and allows the correction forces to distribute along the spine, thereby lowering the possibility of bone fracture and the need for post-operative immobilization.\n\nGradual and constant correction forces have been adopted to overcome the deficiency caused by viscoelastic relaxation of spinal tissues. Such correction forces can take up the loss of correction occurred due to the viscoelastic behaviors of bio- logical tissues and effect a gradual correction of the deformity after the initial surgery. Conventional systems providing gradual or constant correction forces nevertheless require some form of repeated surgery or post-operative care, result- ing in longer hospitalization as well as patient inconvenience and discomfort.\n\nThe C-D spinal instrumentation system, introduced by Cotrel and Dubousset, employs a dual rod system interlinked. by a transverse traction device (DTT), and multiple hooks on each rod. The C-D system was intended to improve thoracic lordosis, preserve lumbar lordosis in the sagittal plane, improve correction in the frontal plane, and minimize loss of correction in case of hook migration or fracture at the bone- metal interface.\n\nOther methods in which a gradual but constant force is applied to the scoliotic spine include external halo traction, intermittent open lengthening and shape change from shape memory alloys. For example, the shape memory effect (SME) of nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy has been used to correct scoliosis in a goat model. However, the mechanical strength of SME was insufficient to fully correct spinal deformities.\n\nSimilar spinal correction systems include the Texas Scot- tish Rite Hospital (TSRH) Universal Spinal Instrumentation and Isola spinal implant system. The TSRH system, in addi- tion to obtaining a better correction of thoracic curves in the sagittal and coronal planes and maintaining lumbar lordosis, also provides rigidity of the implant against axial and tor- sional forces with its Crosslink\u2122 device.

According to the present invention, a con- stant or substantially constant force can be provided for spinal deformity correction. Such a correction force is capable of gradually counteracting the viscoelastic phenomenon of the spine. Accordingly, the present invention is capable of fully or substantially fully correcting spinal deformities. Such correc- tion can be carried out with or without further manipulation of the correction force after the correction force is applied to the deformed spine portion.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates generally to spinal deformity correction. More specifically, the present invention is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force or a similar correction force and maintaining such cor- rection force constant or substantially constant until spinal deformities are corrected. The present invention can correct various spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphosis, lor- dosis, and the rotation around the longitudinal axis of the spine. Additionally or alternatively, the present invention can provide horizontal plane correction of spinal deformities.\n\nFor example, a superelastic or pseudoelastic material can be used to provide a constant or substantially constant cor- rection force or a similar force, which can be applied to a deformed spine portion. The constant correction force so provided is capable of gradually and continuously correcting inal deformities. In an exemplary embodiment, a NiTi alloy an be used to providea constant or substantially constant and ontrollable correction force. It will be appreciated that other mbodiment of superelastic or pseudoelastic materials are within the of the invention. 2seoae\n\nof correcting spinal deformities. The correction device is capable of providing a constant and controllable correction force, which can be applied to the deformed spine portion. Such a correction force can be maintained at a constant or substantially constant level until the spinal deformities are corrected. For example, the correction device can be formed by using the pseudoelastic or superelastic properties of a material, such as a NiTi alloy, to provide a constant or sub- stantially constant and controllable correction force. The cor- rection device is capable of completely correcting the spinal deformity at the time of operation or gradually correcting the spinal deformity both during and after the operation. Addi- tionally or alternatively, the correction device can apply a constant or substantially constant correction force subsequent to the surgery, allowing a gradual correction of the spinal\n\ndoelastic materials that are capable of providing a constant correction force. For example, a superelastic or pseudoelastic material can be formed by mechanically deform or otherwise ysically deform a material beyond its elastic limit but within its plastic limit. The material can be allowed to return to the body temperature through heating or gradual warming using any conventional heating mean. Transformation will occur when the material returns to its initial shape to thereby form a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, which can be used for correcting spinal deformities. The transformation can take place instantaneously or over a period of time from several minutes to days. The correction force generated by such a superelastic or pseudoelastic material can maintain a constant or substantially constant level when such a super- elastic or pseudoelastic material is subject to deformation within the range of the elastic limit and the plastic limit of the ue]\n\n40\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nThe detailed description of the present invention will be better understood in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference characters represent like elements, as follows:\n\nFIGS. lc and 1b show a first embodiment of the correction device before and after securing elements fix the correction device onto the spine, respectively.\n\nAccording to the present invention, spinal deformity cor- rection can be carried out in various manners.
