A barrier control component detects an optical signal in a control region of the projector screen that is providing visual content to the barrier component, and identifies the type of visual content, such as 2-D content or 3-D autostereoscopic content, based on the optical signal. The barrier control component identifies a control signal based on the identified content type, and transmits the control signal to the barrier component via 4 wireline or wireless connection. The barrier component is controlled to automatically switch to a desired mode, such as 2-D mode or 3-D autostereoscopic mode, and employ a desired barrier pattern, in response to the received control signal. The barrier component is powered using a solar cell\n\n(52) US.Cl aa . CPC 201 CB naw Oo ne \u4e86 01); ic 4. 59 a 13.01 \u00a2\n\n. . . (58) Field of Classification Search CPC .....

When ordinary 2-D content is displayed, the active parallax barrier can be totally, or substantially, transparent and have no effect on the projector screen, and, as a result, the ordinary 2-D content can e displayed without being degraded by the active parallax barrier. When 3-D content is displayed, the pattern on the active parallax barrier can be activated to become partially opaque, and different views of the 3-D images can be directed to their corresponding directions, based at least in part on the attern.\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\nThe subject disclosure relates generally to image displays, in particular, to automatic switching of a multi-mode projector display screen for displaying three-dimensional and two-dimensional images.\n\nHowever, conventionally the pattern on the active parallax arrier is activated manually, which can be cumbersome and inefficient. Further, enabling switching of an active parallax arrier to enable desired display of 3-D content and ordinary 2-D content can require modification of the original hardware circuit and/or software of the projector (or a device which drives the projector). It also may be necessary to provide a ower supply to the active parallax barrier, and establish some kind of communication link (e.g., RF, infrared, etc.) between the active parallax barrier and the projection system.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nsince the 1950s. Conventionally, 3-D visual effects have been realized in part by having the viewers wear glasses having a pair of polarized lens, a pair of chromatically opposite lens, or shutter glass spectacles. More recently, lens-free 3-D visual effects have been realized by using multiple cameras to cap- ture multiple angles of a scene, wherein a monitor, employing a lenticular lens array, reconstructs the multiple views for display to the viewers. Such an arrangement is generally expensive and heavy. Another technique for producing lens- free 3-D visual effects is employing a parallax barrier that can reconstruct multiple views of a 3-D scene for display to viewers. The parallax barrier is relatively lower in cost and. lighter in weight, as compared a monitor employing a len- lens\n\nToday, there is no way of efficiently controlling the display of 3-D content and ordinary 2-D content via the same display without the ordinary 2-D content appearing to be degraded, without a user having to manually switch the active parallax barrier on and off and/or without modification of the projec- tion system (e.g., rear projection video projector). Further, conventional techniques for providing power to the active parallax barrier can be inefficient for a variety of other rea- sons. The above-described deficiencies of today\u2019s systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and cor- responding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.\n\ncan realize 3-D visual effects in part by having different pixels carrying different views of a 3-D scene. The 3-D autostereo- scopic display is a technology that can combine multiple perspectives (e.g., multiple 2-D perspectives) of a 3-D scene into a single, integrated 2-D image. Using an autostereo- scopic monitor, the single, integrated 2-D image can be dis- played to a viewer such that each recorded view (e.g., 2-D image from each perspective) of the 3-D scene can be dis- played to the viewer along its corresponding orientation. For instance, as the viewer moves from left to right (or right to left) in relation to the 3-D scene, the viewer can observe different views of the 3-D scene as if the viewer is looking at the actual 3-D environment depicted by the 3-D scene. In addition to displaying multi-view images to the viewer, the autostereoscopic techniques also can provide a 3-D sensation to the viewer as each of the viewer\u2019s eyes can perceive a slightly different image (e.g., different 2-D image from a\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe following presents a simplified summary of the dis- closed subject matter in order to provide a basic understand- ing of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the dis- closed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\n\nThis 3-D technology has motivated numerous research works with the ultimate objective of developing different kinds of 3-D commercial products, such as television, photo frame, computer monitors, and toys, with 3-D technology. The concept also can be applied to display larger 3-D images via rear projection. This can be achieved by projecting the integrated images (e.g., integrated 2-D images that can form 3-D images) onto a projector screen which can be overlaid with a parallax barrier or a lenticular lens array.\n\nmedium disclosed herein relate to controlling switching between multiple display modes to selectively process and display three-dimensional and two-dimensional visual images. Disclosed herein is a system that can include a barrier control component configured to dynamically generate a con- trol signal in real time, based at least in part on a signal sensed from a control region of a projector screen component that presents video content received from a projector component, and transmit the control signal to a barrier component to facilitate controlling selection of a display mode and a corre- sponding barrier pattern that correspond to the control signal and a type of video content being presented, wherein the signal is indicative of the display mode and the corresponding barrier pattern to use to process the video content. The system. also can include a sensor component configured to monitor the control region and sense the signal emitted from the\n\nHowever, when an ordinary 2-D image is displayed in this manner, the resolution can be significantly degraded (e.g., blurry) due in part to the ordinary 2-D image being negatively affected by the parallax barrier. In practice, it can be difficult to change the projector screen (e.g., rear projector screen) according to whether the displayed images are 2-D or 3-D in nature.\n\nThe degradation when displaying a projected ordinary 2-D image can be overcome with the use of an active parallax\n\nand\n\nThree-dimensional (3-D) visual effects have been around\n\nticular\n\narray.

The combination of the arrier control component, the barrier component, and/or the rojector screen component can form a 3-D screen adapter that can process or adapt different types of video content, including normal 2-D content and enhanced 2-D content, to desirably present normal 2-D content, 3-D stereoscopic con- tent, and/or 3-D autostereoscopic content, depending in part on the type of video content received by the projector screen component from the projector component (e.g., rear-projec- tion video projector system) and information (e.g., optical signals) associated with the video content.\n\nConventional video processing of video content to produce three-dimensional (3-D) visual effects has reached the point where 3-D images can be viewed by viewers without the need for 3-D glasses to be worn by the viewers. For example, a3-D autostereoscopic display based on a parallax barrier can real- ize 3-D visual effects in part by having different pixels car- rying different views (e.g., different two-dimensional (2-D) views) ofa 3-D scene. However, one significant deficiency of using such a parallax barrier is that, when ordinary 2-D con- tent is passed through the parallax barrier, the 2-D content can be degraded (e.g., blurry) when displayed to the viewers.\n\nRear projection systems for displaying 3-D content are relatively rare. Existing rear projection systems for display- ing 3-D content can typically be implemented by overlaying a parallax barrier, or a lenticular lens array on top of the projector screen. However, existing rear projection systems also experience the significant deficiency of using such a parallax barrier in that, when ordinary 2-D content is passed through the parallax barrier associated with the projector screen, the 2-D content can be degraded (e.g., blurry) when displayed to the viewers.\n\nIn some implementations, one or more respective signals (e.g., optical signals) can be embedded in a signal region contained in each of one or more images (e.g., normal or enhanced 2-D images) of video content (e.g., sequence of video images). A projector component can project the one or more images on a projector screen component. The projector screen component can include a control region in a portion of the projector screen. The control region can be used to present the signal contained in a visual image to facilitate controlling processing and displaying of visual images. When the visual image is projected on the projector screen component, the signal can be presented (e.g., displayed or projected) in the control region of the projector screen component.\n\nAn active parallax barrier can be overlaid on the projector screen to enable the barrier to be transparent when 2-D con- tent is being displayed in order to present the 2-D content without being degraded. For instance, the active parallax barrier can allow a user to manually switch the active parallax barrier on for the display of 3-D content and off for the display of ordinary 2-D content, so that the 2-D content can be clearly displayed. However, such arrangement can be inconvenient, particularly due to the parallax barrier having to be switched on and off manually by a user.\n\nA barrier control component can detect the signal(s) (e.g., optical signal having a specified optical pattern, optical signal having or providing a specified number of data bits that cor- respond to a specified data value based at least in part on the respective data values of the respective data bits) in the con- trol region as the visual image is presented on the projector screen component. In some implementations, the barrier con- trol component can include a sensor component that can include a sensor array (e.g., a subset of light sensors) that can detect the signal in the control region. The sensor component can be configured to face and be aligned with, or otherwise associated with, the control region of the projector screen component so that the sensor component can detect the sig- nals communicated (e.g., transmitted, emitted) from the con- trol region in relation to presentation of the visual images on the projector screen component. The barrier control compo- nent can identify the type of visual content (e.g., 2-D content, 3-D stereoscopic content, or 3-D autostereoscopic content) being presented on the projector screen component, based at least in part on the detected signal (e.g., data value associated with (e.g., represented by) the optical signal, visual pattern of\n\nAlternatively, the active parallax barrier can be synchro- nized with an electrical signal which is extracted from the video. However, to do this, it can be necessary to modify the hardware and/or software of the projection system. Further, it can be necessary to supply electrical power to the active parallax barrier through a pair of conduction wires.\n\nToday, there is no way of efficiently and effectively con- trolling the display of 3-D content and 2-D content via the same display without 2-D content appearing to be blurry and/or without a user having to manually switch the parallax barrier on and off and/or without modification of the projec- tion system.\n\nThe disclosed subject matter includes techniques for con- trolling (e.g., automatically or dynamically in real time) switching of a barrier component (e.g., active parallax barrier component) to facilitate efficiently displaying various types of 2-D content and 3-D content, for example, on a projector screen (e.g., rear projection screen). A projector screen com- ponent can be employed to project or display visual images. In some implementations, the projector screen component can be or can include a rear projection screen. The projector screen component can be associated with a barrier component that can facilitate display of various types of video content, including ordinary 2-D content, 3-D stereoscopic content, and/or 3-D autostereoscopic content. The barrier component can be associated with (e.g., attached, adhered, or connected to), for example, a projector or display screen side of the\n\nIn accordance with additional or alternative embodiments, the signal transmitted by the projector component and/or received by the projector screen component can be an audio signal having a specified frequency (e.g., audio signal that is above or below the audio frequency range of humans (e.g., above 20 kHz or below 20 Hz)). The sensor component of the barrier control component can detect the audio signal associ- ated with the visual image as the visual image is being pro- jected or displayed on the projector screen component.

In response to receiving the control signal, the barrier component can switch (e.g., automatically or dynamically in real time) to (or remain in) or select (e.g., automatically or dynamically in real time) a specified display mode, such as 2-D mode, 3-D stereoscopic mode, or 3-D autostereoscopic mode, wherein there can be respective bar- rier pattern modes and corresponding barrier patterns that can be utilized in the respective display modes to facilitate desir- ably presenting 2-D content or different types of 3-D content to a viewer (e.g., presenting 2-D content without blurriness, presenting 3-D stereoscopic content or 3-D autostereoscopic\n\nIn accordance with various other embodiments, the barrier control component, barrier component, and/or projector screen component can be associated with an external power supply.

In some embodiments, the barrier control component can be a stand-alone unit, which can be adhered, attached, or placed in proximity to the barrier component and/or projector screen component such that the sensor component of the barrier control component can face and be aligned with, or otherwise associated with, the control region of the projector screen component so that the barrier control component can detect the signals communicated (e.g., transmitted, emitted) from the control region in relation to presentation of the visual the\n\nbarrier component, wherein different control signals can cor- respond to different control voltages that can correspond to different display modes. The corresponding control voltage can be applied to the barrier component to facilitate selecting the corresponding barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern to utilize in processing the received visual image to present the processed visual image in accordance with the selected. display mode. For instance, when the video content is normal 2-D content, the barrier pattern mode selected can be a trans- parent barrier pattern that passes through the received 2-D video content without further processing to facilitate display- ing the normal 2-D content without the blurriness that is otherwise typically encountered in conventional display sys- tems using an active barrier. When the video content is enhanced 2-D content (e.g., 2-D content comprising a plural- ity of 2-D images that represent respective portions of a 3-D scene or image), the barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pat- tern selected in response to the control signal can be one of a plurality of partially opaque 3-D barrier patterns (e.g., 3-D stereoscopic barrier pattern, 3-D autostereoscopic barrier pat- tern, etc.) that can receive the enhanced 2-D content and can convert the enhanced 2-D content to produce video content that reconstructs the 3-D scene (also referred to herein as the 3-D object scene), and that produced video content can be presented to a viewer via the projector screen component as\n\nsubject matter, by integrating control component and barrier component with the projector screen component, and operating as more fully disclosed herein, can control selection of various display modes to desirably present (e.g., display, project) various types of 2-D content and 3-D content to a viewer.

In some implementations, the barrier compo- nent can contain respective mappings of available control signals to available barrier pattern modes (and/or correspond- ing available barrier patterns). The barrier component can identify and select the barrier pattern mode (and/or corre- sponding barrier pattern) that is mapped to the control signal, based at least in part on the mapping information.\n\nAt 1204, an optical signal can be detected (e.g., automati- cally or dynamically, in real time) in the control region of the projector screen component in relation to presentation of the 2-D visual image(s) on the projector screen component. The 2-D visual image(s) can be presented on the projector screen component. The signal embedded in the 2-D visual image(s) can be presented in the control region of the projector screen component. The sensor component can detect or sense the signal presented (e.g., emitted) in the control region of the projector screen component.\n\nsignal can be processed using the identified barrier pattern, in the identified barrier pattern mode, to generate processed video content comprising a generated or reconstructed 2-D or 3-D scene. For example, normal 2-D video content can be processed using a transparent barrier pattern (e.g., barrier pattern in transparent barrier pattern mode) that will pass the normal 2-D video content through without affecting or alter- ing the normal 2-D video content. As another example, enhanced 2-D video content, which can be used to reconstruct a 3-D scene, can be processed using an applicable 3-D type barrier pattern (e.g., barrier pattern for 3-D stereoscopic video content, barrier pattern for 3-D autostereoscopic video con- tent) while in the corresponding barrier pattern mode, as more fully disclosed herein, to generate or reconstruct 3-D video\n\nAt 1206, light energy of the optical signal can be converted into electrical energy. The sensor component can include a sensor array comprising a subset of sensors that can sense or detect the optical signals. In some implementations, the sub- set of sensors can be a subset of solar cells that can detect the optical signal, and can convert the light energy of the optical signal into electrical energy, for example, via a photovoltaic effect process or indirectly by first converting the light energy into heat energy and converting the heat energy to electrical energy.\n\nAt 1308, processed video content, comprising the gener- ated or reconstructed scene (e.g., 2-D scene or 3-D scene), can be presented. For example, the barrier component can present the processed video content comprising the generated or reconstructed scene as an output, which can be viewed by a viewer.\n\nAt 1208, the electrical energy can be provided, for example, to a power supply component. The sensor compo- nent can provide the electrical energy (e.g., electrical power) to the power supply component of the barrier control compo- nent. The power supply component can store the electrical energy in a battery component and/or can provide some or all of the electrical energy to other components of the barrier control component or to other components (e.g., barrier com- ponent, projector screen component) to facilitate powering one or more components associated with the barrier control component.\n\nisclosed subject matter, FIGS. 14 and 15 as well as the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general escription of a suitable environment in which the various aspects of the disclosed subject matter may be implemented. While the subject matter has been described above in the general context of computer-executable instructions of a computer program that runs on a computer and/or computers, those skilled in the art will recognize that the subject disclo- sure also may be implemented in combination with other program modules. Generally, program modules include rou- tines, programs, components, data structures, etc. that per- form particular tasks and/or implement particular abstract ita types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the inventive methods may be practiced with other com- puter system configurations, including single-processor or multiprocessor computer systems, mini-computing devices, mainframe computers, as well as personal computers, hand- held computing devices (e.g., personal digital assistant (PDA), phone), microprocessor-based or programmable con- sumer or industrial electronics, and the like. The illustrated aspects may also be practiced in distributed computing envi- ronments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. However, some, ifnotall aspects of the subject disclosure can practiced on stand-alone computers. In a distributed com- uting environment, modules be located in both fas\n\nFIG. 13 illustrates a flow diagram of an example method 1300 that can utilize a received control signal to facilitate controlling (e.g., automatically or dynamically, in real time) switching or selecting of a particular display mode of a plu- rality of available display modes of a barrier component in accordance with various embodiments and aspects of the disclosed subject matter. The method 1300 can be imple- mented by a barrier component, in response to receiving a control signal from a barrier control component, to facilitate controlling switching or selecting of a particular display mode of the plurality of available display modes to facilitate desirable display of video content by the projector screen component in conjunction with the barrier component.\n\nAt 1302, a control signal can be received. The barrier component can receive the control signal from the barrier control component in relation to controlling switching or selecting a barrier pattern mode (and/or corresponding barrier pattern) that can correspond to the control signal to facilitate processing video content being presented by the barrier com- ponent, in conjunction with the projector screen component, to a viewer(s).\n\nAt 1304, a barrier pattern mode (and/or corresponding barrier pattern), of a plurality of available barrier pattern modes (and/or corresponding available barrier patterns), can be identified (e.g., automatically or dynamically, in real time) based at least in part on the received control signal. In an aspect, the barrier component can analyze the control signal, and based at least in part on the information contained in the control signal, the barrier component can identify and select\n\nWith reference to FIG. 14, a suitable environment 1400 for implementing various aspects of the claimed subject matter includes a computer 1412.
