The power contro] circuit of the charging pad consists of two power conversion stages. Depending on the nature of the input power supply, the first power stage is an AC-DC power converter with variable output voltage control and a second stage is a DC-AC power inverter with constant current control. The combination ofthe two stages provides power control of the charging pad and generates AC magnetic flux of ideally constant magnitude over the charging areas within a group of primary windings that excited.\n\n(51) Int.

No. 6,501,364, and Tang S. C., Hui S. Y. R and. Chung H., \u201cEvaluation of the Shielding Effects on Printed- Circuit-Board Transformers using Ferrite Plates and Copper Sheets,\u201d JEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Vol. 17, No. 6, November 2002, pp. 1080-1088.\n\nchargers a been developed for use with some types of portable electronic equipment such as electric toothbrushes. Inductive chargers have also been proposed in a number of documents such as . Pat. No. 6,356,049, U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,128, U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,249. These inductive chargers, however, use tradi- tional transformer designs with windings wound around fer- rite magnetic cores and the main magnetic flux between the primary winding and secondary winding has to go through the magnetic core materials. Other contactless chargers pro- posed (e.g., Chang-Gyun Kim; Dong-Hyun Seo; Jung-Sik You; Jong-Hu Park; Cho, B. H., \u201cDesign of a contactless battery charger for cellular phone,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Volume: 48, Issue: 6, December 2001 Page(s): 1238-1247) also use magnetic cores as the main structure for the coupled transformer windings. However, these battery chargers do not use a planar structure and each charger is only able to charge one item of electronic equip- ment at time.\n\nThe second approach described in WO03/105308A, GB2389720A, GB2399446A, GB2389767A, GB2389767A, W02007/019806 is to create an AC magnetic field with the flux lines flowing substantially vertically out of the planar charging surfaces, i.e., in a direction substantially perpen- dicular to the plane of the charging platform. Since the lines of flux enter and leave the planar charging surface vertically, a very thin secondary coil can be used to pick up the magnetic flux. This results in the possibility of a slim design for the secondary module that can be embedded in the portable elec- tronic load.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided, in a first aspect, a planar battery charging system comprising a primary power transmission side formed of an array of primary windings adapted to generate magnetic flux substantially perpendicular to a charging surface, and a secondary power receiving side comprising a secondary winding associated with a battery to be charged and being adapted to receive the magnetic flux when a sec- ondary winding is placed on the charging surface. A primary winding is energized by a control circuit com- prising a first-stage power converter and a second stage power inverter, both being on the primary power trans- mission side, the first stage power converter being con- trolled to provide a controlled variable DC link voltage on the primary power transmission side, and the second stage power inverter generating a controlled fixed fre- AC the\n\n40\n\nRecent research in the field of planar magnetics and planar transformer technology has prompted the development of planar contactless battery charging systems for portable elec- tronic equipment. Among them, two proposals are particu- larly of interest, because they allow one or more items of electronic equipment to be placed and charged simulta- neously on the charging surface, regardless of the orientation of the electronic equipment. 45\n\nThe first type of planar battery charger modifies the rotat- ing machine concept by flattening the \u201cround shape\u201d of the motor into a \u201cpancake shape,\u201d as described in GB2399225A, GB2398176A, WO2004/038888A, GB2388716A, US2003- 210106-A1, GB2392024A, and GB2399230A. The magnetic flux lines flow horizontally along (roughly in parallel to) the planar charging surfaces. The portable electronic equipment to be charged by the charging device needs a secondary wind- ing wound on preferably a soft magnetic core. An AC voltage will be induced in this secondary winding for charging the battery, usually via a battery charging circuit. 50\n\nThe first-stage power converter may be either current con- trolled or voltage-controlled. Preferably, the current fed to primary winding is monitored to provide a feedback control the variable DC link voltage.\n\nA fundamental and inherent limitation of this type of bat- tery charger is that this charging device must have a good. electromagnetic flux guide to confine the flux along the lower surface. Otherwise, if such a charging device is placed on a metallic table or a conductive surface, induced current will circulate in the metallic table or conductive surface, resulting in heat generation and power loss in the metallic table or conductive surface. One imperfect way to solve this problem\n\nsome invention, a step-down trans- former may be provided between the output of the second- stage power inverter and the primary winding.\n\nThe second-stage power inverter may comprise a resonant tank that sets the frequency of the AC current supplied to the winding. In such embodiments, the second-stage power inverter is switched at a constant frequency that is equal to the frequency of the resonant tank.\n\nInductive electronic\n\nwith\n\ndirect connection have\n\na\n\n35\n\nquency constant\n\ncurrent to\n\nprimary winding.\n\nthe\n\nof\n\nIn\n\nembodiments of the\n\nUS 8,228,025 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPreferably, the secondary side is adapted to receive power\n\nfrequency and a set of basic secondary circuit design features.\n\noptimally at the excitation frequency of the primary winding.\n\nIn other words, the secondary circuits in a wide range of\n\nThe first-stage power converter may be, for example, a\n\nelectronic loads should be compatible with the magnetic flux\n\ngenerated by the charging pad.\n\nboost converter, or a buck converter, or a flyback converter, or\n\nIn the following, methods and apparatus that can provide\n\na Cuk converter or a Sepic converter.

An example of boost converter is given in FIG. 2. Ifthe input power supply is an AC voltage source (such as the AC mains), an AC-DC power converter with or without power factor correction can be used as the front-stage power converter. An AC-DC con- verter typically consists of a diode rectifier and a DC-DC converter. An example of a flyback type AC-DC converter is shown in FIG. 3.

An AC-DC flyback converter comprising (diode bridge 2 and gate driver 3) operating under a voltage-control mode is illustrated here. Sensing resistor Rsen is used to monitor the current feeding the inverter. This sensed current signal is filtered by a resistive-capacitive filter and then compared with reference value (Vref\u2014which is arbitrarily set at 2.5V and represents the desired current value in the inverter) in an error amplifier 4, which generates an error signal in its output. This current error signal (Ve) is then fed to a comparator 5 and compared with a sawtooth reference signal (Vsw) that is set at specific frequency which determines the switching fre- quency of the first-stage AC-DC flyback converter. The out- put of this comparator provides the PWM signal for switching the power converter. The duty cycle of this PWM signal controls the output voltage of the flyback converter (i.e. the DC-link voltage Vdc). Vde is controlled in a manner that keeps the current flowing into the inverter to the desired value within a certain small tolerance. The second-stage inverter is simply driven at constant frequency (at the resonant fre- quency of the resonant tank in the primary circuit) to inject an AC current of constant magnitude into the primary circuit of the charging pad. The resonant tank of the primary circuit ensures that current in the primary winding(s) of an active group is sinusoidal in order to reduce harmonic losses and\n\nThe control principle is now explained with reference to FIG. 1. The front-stage power converter controls its output voltage (Vdc) by varying the duty-cycle of the converter switch. Typically, a pulse-width modulation (PWM) tech- nique is used to control the duty-cycle of the converter switch, which in turn, controls the output voltage of the power con- verter. The duty-cycle function is denoted as M(d) in FIG. 1. The first-stage power converter that provides a controllable DC-link voltage (Vdc) can be controlled either in \u201cvoltage control\u201d mode or in \u201ccurrent control\u201d mode.\n\nThe second-stage power inverter adopts a fixed frequency control. Generally, the diagonal pairs of switches in the full- bridge inverter are switched together and the two pairs are switched in a complementary manner so that an AC voltage can be generated at the output of the inverter. If necessary, a small dead time can be introduced in the switching instants of the two switches in the same inverter leg in order to achieve soft switching, thus reducing the switching loss and EMI radiation. The inverter is switched at a constant frequency, which should preferably be the same as the resonant fre- quency of the resonant tank in the primary circuit. Since the current fed from the first-stage power converter is kept con- stant, the second-stage inverter generates a fixed-frequency constant AC current into the winding(s) of an active group. The fixed-frequency operation is important because the sec- ondary circuits of the electronic loads will be designed to receive power transfer at this frequency. This frequency should preferably be chosen so that the radiated electromag- netic interference (EMI) should not violate international elec- (EMC)\n\nFIG. 8 shows an example implementation of the invention, where the first-stage power converter is operated under cur- rent-control mode. In this implementation, the current sensor Rsen is used to sense the current feeding into the inverter. The sensed current signal is filtered and then compared with a desired current reference (Vref\u2014arbitrarily set at 2.5V) in an error amplifier 14. The current error signal (Ve) is the output of this error amplifier. Another current sensor Rs is used to monitor the current in the power switch of the flyback con- verter. This switch current is the same as the current in the primary winding of the coupled inductor in the flyback con- verter. The sensed switch current (Vipk) is filtered and then compared with Ve at comparator 15 in order to generate the PWM signal for driving the switch of the flyback converter. The objective is to for the first-stage converter to feed a desired level of current into the second-stage inverter. The second-stage inverter is simply driven at constant frequency (at the resonant frequency of the resonant tank in the primary circuit) to inject an AC current of constant magnitude into the primary circuit of the charging pad. The resonant tank of the primary circuit ensures that current in the primary winding is sinusoidal in order to reduce harmonic losses and EMI radia- tion.\n\nUnder voltage-control mode, the first-stage power con- verter feeds DC-link voltage to the second-stage power inverter. Under current-control mode, the first-stage power converter feeds a DC current to the second-stage power inverter. In both operating modes, the objective is to maintain a constant current feeding the second-stage power inverter. That is, under voltage-control mode, the power converter will vary its output voltage (Vdc) in order to keep constant the current feeding the second-stage inverter. Under the current- control mode, the power converter is controlled to provide a current of a desired value to the second-stage inverter.\n\nThe current feeding the second-stage power inverter is monitored by a current sensor which can be a small resistor or a hall-effect current sensor. If the power absorbed by the secondary load increases (decreases), this current may be reduced (increased). A feedback current is compared with a preset reference (Vref) that represents the desired current feeding the primary winding, which can be set by users, or according to some standard or to flux, power or other require- ments communicated back from the load. The error signal is then amplified by amplifier A and compared by a comparator C with a triangular carrier reference of a fixed frequency that determines the switching frequency of the first-stage power converter. The duty cycle will be dynamically adjusted to control the DC-link voltage (Vdc) so as to keep the current feeding the second-stage inverter to the desired current value within a small tolerance.\n\nThe same principle can be implemented using a boost converter as the first-stage under voltage-control mode current-control mode as shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, respec- tively.\n\nAn alternative way to inject a sinusoidal current into the winding(s) of an active group of the charging pad is to use a second-stage power inverter to drive a resonant tank formed by a capacitor and the primary winding of a step-down trans- former 20. Example circuit schematics are shown in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12. The use of a step-down transformer has the advantage that the DC-link voltage of the inverter can be set to a higher value so that the current injected into the capacitor and the primary winding of the transformer can be kept to a relatively low value. This facilitates the choice of components in the circuit by avoiding the need for components such as capacitors that are suitable for use with large currents.
