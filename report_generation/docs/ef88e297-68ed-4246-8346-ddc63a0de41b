The entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates to an apparatus and method for Plasma-Based Ion Implantation (PBID), and in particular though not exclusively to such a method that is suitable for use with implantation materials that have a low melting point and high vapor pressure.\n\nThe evaporation chamber may be formed with an opening for allowing vaporized source material to exit the evaporation chamber, with the opening having a relatively small dimen- sion compared with the internal area of said evaporation chamber. For example the ratio of the opening to the top area of the evaporation chamber is greater than 4. Preferably the evaporating and supply means is removable from said appa- ratus.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nFocused Electric Field Enhanced Plasma-Based Ion Implantation (FEFE-PBII) relates to a process for focused electric field enhanced plasma apparatus and methods and the following plasma-based ion implantation. One of the tech- niques belonging to the family of plasma-based ion implan- tation is plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII), which is a useful niche technology for the modification of surface prop- erties of materials and industrial components, especially such materials and components that are large or that have an irregu- lar shape. The samples are immersed in plasma from which ions are extracted and implanted in the surface of the samples.\n\nvided a method for performing plasma-based ion implanta- tion. The method comprises locating a sample on a sample holder in an implantation chamber, supplying gaseous or vaporized implantation material to the implantation chamber through a feed conduit, the feed conduit having an end that opens into the implantation chamber and above the sample holder to form a feed conduit exit opening, the end and the feed conduit exit opening formed by the end defining a feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, and the sample holder defining a sample holder cross-sectional area situated opposite from the feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, the feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area being smaller than said sample holder cross-sectional area. The method further comprises applying a negative potential to the sample holder while maintaining the end at a potential that is positive relative to the sample holder so as to generate an electron focused electric field between the sample holder and the feed conduit exit opening that is effective to generate a glow discharge to create a plasma from the gaseous or vapor- ized implantation material, whereby ions from the plasma are\n\nPRIOR ART\n\nvided to supply the ions for implantation. Typically the plasma may be generated by, for example, thermionic dis- charge, pulsed high-voltage glow discharge, radio frequency plasma sources, microwave plasma sources, cathodic arc metal plasma sources and sputtering targets amongst other possibilities. After the plasma has been generated, a negative potential is applied to the sample holder which negative potential serves to attract positive ions out of the plasma and to accelerate them towards the sample where they are implanted. A problem with conventional techniques, how- ever, is that there does not exist a single plasma source that is capable of generating a plasma containing ions of all possible elements. For example, it is very difficult to generate a plasma containing positive ions of solid materials with poor electrical conductivity such as sulfur, phosphorous and boron, and. poorly or semiconducting materials such as silicon, germa- nium and elements with low melting points and high vapor pressure. Unfortunately many of these materials that are dif- ficult to implant are materials where the ability to perform\n\nIn a preferred embodiment the method comprises forming electron focused electric field to enhance the ionization plasma, and where the electron focused electric field formed by the small exit opening and the large area sample holder.\n\nPreferably a negative potential is applied to said sample holder as a series of pulses and maintaining said exit opening grounded.

Plasma generating means 22 is pro- vided simply to enable the apparatus to function in a conven- tional manner (with the implantation chamber 2 removed) in addition to the novel manner to be described below, and plasma generating means 22 will therefore not be described in detail.\n\nAlternatively the implantation material may be gaseous and is supplied to said inlet conduit.\n\nPreferably the pressure in said implantation chamber is maintained above a breakdown pressure to maintain a steady- state glow discharge between said sample holder and said exit opening of said inlet conduit.\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of performing plasma based ion implan- tation. The method comprises feeding a gaseous or vaporized. implantation material to an implantation chamber through a feed conduit, and supporting a sample to be implanted on a sample holder, the feed conduit having an end that opens into the implantation chamber to form a feed conduit exit opening, the end and the feed conduit exit opening formed by the end defining a feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, and. the sample holder defining a sample holder cross-sectional area situated opposite from the feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, the feed conduit exit opening cross- sectional area being smaller than the sample holder cross sectional area. The method further comprises generating a glow-discharge between the sample holder and the feed con- duit exit opening by applying a negative potential to the sample holder to generate a plasma from the gaseous or vaporized implantation material, whereby ions of the implan- tation material are generated and accelerated towards the sample.\n\nTo one side of the vacuum chamber 1 there is means for vaporizing a solid material 18. This vaporizing means comprises an evaporation chamber 17, a heating device 16 and a thermally insulating shield 15 designed to ensure that heat generated by the heating device 16 is directed into the evaporation chamber 17 for greater efficiency rather than externally of the evaporation chamber 17. At the top of the evaporation chamber 17 there is formed a neck 23 that connects the evaporation chamber 17 to the feed conduit 4 that leads through a side wall of the vacuum chamber 1 to the top of the implantation chamber 2 where the feed conduit 4 is formed with an exit opening 3 into the implantation chamber 2 located above the sample 5. provided a\n\nIf it is desired to form a plasma containing ions of an element with a low melting point, such as for example sulfur, a sample of sulfur (solid material 18) is placed within the evaporation chamber 17 and is vaporized to form a vapor 19 by the application of heat through heating device 16. Heating device 16 may be any convenient heating device such as, for example, a high frequency heating device. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 the heating device 16 surrounds the evaporation chamber 17, but alternatively the heating device 16 may be located simply at the bottom of the evaporation chamber 17. The vaporized sulfur is then allowed to escape from the evaporation chamber 17 through the neck 23 of the evapora- tion chamber which neck 23 has a diameter that is relatively small compared to the size of the evaporation chamber 17 so that the sulfur vapor may be in a quasi-equilibrium state within the evaporation chamber 17. Generally, the ratio of the entrance area of the neck 23 to the top area of the evaporation chamber 17 should be more than 4.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: \u2014\n\nFIG. 1 is a sectional view through a FEFE-PBII apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention,\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates the electric field lines in the implantation chamber in the embodiment of FIG. 1,\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates the changing potential between the sample holder and the opening of the inlet conduit,\n\nFIG. 4 shows as an example the depth of implantation of sulfur atoms using the apparatus of the embodiment of FIG. 1.\n\nThe sulfur vapor 19 that escapes from the evaporation chamber 17 is fed to the feed conduit 4 through an input valve 12 controlled by manually operable valve control means 14. Input valve 12 is provided with a valve heating means 13 similar to heating device 16 in order to prevent the sulfur vapor being deposited in the input valve 12 or in the feed conduit 4. The vaporized sulfur then passes along the feed conduit 4 (which is surrounded by an insulating wall 11 again to prevent cooling and deposition of the sulfur) to the exit opening 3 into the implantation chamber 2. Optionally, means may be provided for supplying an inert carrier gas such as argon to facilitate the transfer of the sulfur vapor along the feed conduit 4. The carrier gas can be fed in from side wall of the evaporation chamber 17 or other places around the cham- ber not shown here.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nReferring firstly to FIG. 1 there is shown a FEFE-PBII apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention com- prising a vacuum chamber 1 the pressure in which can be reduced to any desired level by means of a vacuum pump 9. Within the vacuum chamber is provided an implantation chamber 2 in which is located a sample holder 6 for support- ing a sample 5 to be implanted with ions. The implantation chamber 2 is a smaller chamber made of an insulating mate- rial such as glass which serves to protect the remainder of the vacuum chamber from contamination by the vapor that is supplied to the chamber 2 as will be discussed below. The implantation chamber 2, being made of an insulating mate- rial, also serves to electrically isolate the sample holder 6 from the exit opening 3 of the feed conduit 4 for reasons that will be understood from the description below. The implan- tation chamber 2 may be removed completely if the vacuum chamber 1 is to be used as part of a conventional PBII appa- ratus. The vacuum chamber 1 can also be removed com- pletely if the implantation chamber 2 is also used as the vacuum chamber to conduct FEFE-PBII. Sample holder 6 is formed at the end of a conductive rod 7 which extends though a wall of the vacuum chamber 1 through an insulating ring 8. An of the chamber 1 is with\n\nIt should also be noted that the evaporation chamber 17 and heating device 16, input valve 12 and input valve heating means 13, together with the first part of the feed conduit 4 surrounded by a thermally insulating wall 11, form an integral unit for vaporizing solid state materials and other materials and for supplying the resulting vapor into the PBII apparatus. This integral vaporizing and supply means is connected to the remainder of the PBII apparatus by means of a quick release flange 10. By means of the quick release flange 10, the inte- gral vaporizing and supply means may be removed if not needed and in its place a supply conduit for a gaseous plasma forming material may be used if the material to be implanted is one that is gaseous under standard conditions.\n\nby\n\nupper region\n\nvacuum\n\nprovided\n\na\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 8,119,208 B2\n\n6\n\n5\n\nIn the presently described preferred embodiment of the\n\nAlternatively the feed conduit 4 may be closed off alto\n\ngether and plasma may be supplied to the vacuum chamber 1\n\ninvention, the mean free path of the vaporized Sulfur atoms is\n\nin a conventional manner elsewhere, and the implantation\n\nmuch larger than the diameter of the feed conduit 4 and thus\n\nchamber 2 may be removed, thus allowing an embodiment of\n\nthe vapor enters the feed conduit 4 in the form of a laminar\n\nthe invention to be integrated into a conventional PBII appa\n\nflow.

As discussed above, when the vapor flows into the implantation chamber a glow discharge is created under the influence of the high negative potential applied to the sample holder 6 this creating a plasma and beginning the implanta- tion process. However, to maintain a steady-state glow dis- charge the pressure in the implantation chamber must exceed the breakdown pressure. An analysis of the conditions for establishing the breakdown pressure shows that the determin- ing factors are the pressure in the evaporation chamber 17,\n\nimplanted is supported on a sample holder 6 made of a con- ducting material and the sample holder 6 is supported on an electrically conductive rod 7. In use of the embodiment of FIG. 1, the conductive rod 7 and the sample holder 6 are connected to a source of negative potential and a highly negative voltage (eg 15 kV) is applied to the sample holder 6. The negative potential may be applied as a series of pulses, or in a long-pulse pseudo DC manner. In contrast the feed con- duit 4, thermally insulating wall 11, and the shield 15 sur- rounding the evaporation chamber 16 are all electrically grounded, therefore an electric field is established between the exit opening 3 of the feed conduit 4 (which is grounded and thus acts as an anode) and the negatively charged sample holder 6. The area of the exit opening 3 is much less than that of the sample holder 6. The electrons in the plasma as well as the secondary electron exited from the sample holder 6 will all fly to the exit opening 3, a focused electric field is formed between the exit opening 3 and the sample holder 6. To form this focused electric field, the ratio of the anode (exit opening 3) to cathode (sample holder 6) should be more than 6. The electric field acts to ionize the sulfur vapor entering the implantation chamber 2 through the exit opening 3 forming an electron cloud/plasma 20. Sulfur ions are then accelerated in the direction of arrows 21 under the influence of the electric field and are accelerated towards the sample 5 in which\n\nIn the following analysis\n\nP,\u00bbp\u2014pressure in the implantation chamber 2\n\nP.ounce=bressure in the evaporation chamber 17 (ifa carrier gas is used P,..,,,.. reflects the combined pressure of the vapor and the carrier gas) and is determined by the evaporation rate and the gas flow rate\n\nUnwe=conductance of the feed conduit 4 determined by the length and diameter of the conduit 4 and the average speed of the vaporized atoms\n\nS,ump=the pumping speed of pump 9\n\nee Cee +S pump 1 + pe Gube\n\nFrom Eq. 1 it can be seen that by selecting an appropriate pressure in the evaporation chamber (to be determined by selecting the size of the evaporation chamber, and the applied temperature which will determine the evaporation rate), appropriate dimensions for the feed conduit 4, and a suitable pumping speed for pump 9, the pressure in the implantation chamber can be set so that in the steady state it is greater than the breakdown pressure and a steady-state glow discharge can be established.\n\nvoltage to the sample holder 6 an electric field is established. that serves both to ionize the sulfur vapor entering the implan- tation chamber 2, and also to accelerate the resulting sulfur ions towards the surface of the sample. FIG. 2 shows as an example the potential distribution between the negatively charged sample holder 6 marked B in the Figure, and the grounded exit opening 3 marked A in the Figure when a negative voltage of 15 kV is applied to the sample holder 6. Electrons formed by the ionization of the sulfur vapor will move in the direction that the potential changes the fastest and the force on them is along the direction of an equipotential surface. Secondary electrons will also be emitted from the sample holder 6 and these electrons will also travel in the same direction and will move towards the exit opening 3 which forms the anode. The electrons resulting from the ionization of the sulfur vapor and the secondary electrons from the sample holder 6 will thus be focused on the outlet 3 and will form the electron cloud 20 shown in FIG. 1. The presence of this electron cloud 20 will in turn further assist in the generation of sulfur ions by the interaction of the electron cloud with the sulfur vapor exiting the exit opening 3. FIG. 3 illustrates the potential (shown on the y axis) between the holder 6 the and the exit 3\n\nIt will also be noted that as particles in the implantation c! implantation takes place if the amber 2 are used up, the pres- sure in the implantation chamber will fall and if it falls below the breakdown pressure the glow discharge will fail and the implantation process will stop until the pressure in the implantation chamber rises above the breakdown pressure again. To achieve stable operation therefore there should be sufficient vaporized atoms in the implantation chamber such that Pump>Poreakuowm That is to say\n\nCue Proarce Qinp Piggy = ORE eee _ Gre + Spump \u2014 Urabe + Spiomp and Spump Poreatdown + Com Uconduit = \u2014\u2014_ p, Psource ~ Preakdown\n\nWhere Q,,,,=particle consumption rate during implanta- tion.\n\nAs mentioned above, the vaporizing source is preferably a quasi-equilibrium source in order to control the input vapor flow and implantation stability. To achieve this quasi-equilib- rium the interior of the evaporation chamber 17 is relatively large witha large internal area. The feed conduit 4 is relatively Jong and with a small internal diameter (eg 6 mm). The ratio of the length of the feed conduit 4 to the internal diameter should be more than 4.\n\nIt will thus be seen that by appropriate design of the key parameters suchas the length and diameter of the feed conduit 4, the evaporation rate in the evaporation chamber 17, and the pumping rate of the pump 9, asteady-state glow discharge can be established and continuous implantation of atoms into the sample can take place. Should the particle consumption be such that the pressure in the implantation chamber falls below\n\nAs discussed above, the sample 5 in which the ions are to be\n\nthey\n\nare then implanted.
