As the switching frequency of power converter increases, the size of magnetic core can be reduced. When the switching frequency is high enough (e.g. a few Megahertz), the magnetic core can be eliminated. Low-cost coreless PCB transformers for signal and low- power (a few Watts) applications have been proposed by the present inventors in U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 08/018,871 and U.S. Ser.

In power transfer applications however, the PCB transformers have to be shielded to comply with EMC regulations. Investigations of planar transformer shielded with ferrite sheets have been reported and the energy efficiency of a PCB transformer shielded with ferrite sheets can be higher than 90% in Megahertz operating frequency range.

The dielectric breakdown voltage of typical FR4 laminates range from 15 kV to 40 kV. Insulating layers between the copper windings and the ferrite plates should have high thermal conductivity in order to facilitate heat transfer from the transformer windings to the ferrite plates and the ambient. The insulating layer should also be a good electrical insulator to isolate the ferrite plates from the printed transformer windings. A thermally conductive sili- cone rubber compound coated onto a layer of woven glass fibre, which has breakdown voltage of 4.5 kV and thermal conductivity of 0.79 Wm7'K\"', is used to provide high dielectric strength and facilitate heat transfer.

As an example, the modified transformer and the ferrite-shielded transformer are of the same dimensions as shown in Table I. The area and thickness of the conductive sheets in the example arc 25 mmx25 mm and 70 um, respectively.\n\nThe tangential (H,) and normal (H,) components of magnetic field intensity near the boundary between the ferrite plate and free space, at R=1 mm, are plotted in FIG. 6. The tangential H-field (H,) is about 23.2 dB and is continuous at the boundary. The normal component of the H-field (H,) in the free space is about 31.5 dB and that inside the ferrite plate is about 12.5 dB at the boundary. The normal component of the H-field is, therefore, about 8% of the resultant H-field inside the ferrite plate at the boundary. Thus, the ferrite plate alone cannot completely guide the H-field in the tangential direction. As described in (3), the normal component of the H-field in the free space is 80 times larger than that in the ferrite plate at the boundary. From the simulated results in FIG. 6, the normal component of the magnetic field intensity in the free space is about 19 dB, ie. 79.4 times, higher than that inside the ferrite plate. Thus, both simulated results and theory described in (3) show that the using ferrite plates only is not an effective way to shield the magnetic field generated from the planar transformer.\n\nThe magnetic field intensity generated from the shielded PCB transformers is simulated with a 2D field simulator using, a finite-element-method (FEM). A cylindrical coordi- nates system is chosen in the magnetic field simulation. The drawing model, in R-Z plane, of the PCB transformer shown in FIG. 4 is applied in the field simulator. The z-axis is the axis of symmetry, which passes through the center of the transformer windings. In the 2D simulation, the spiral cir- cular conductive tracks are approximated as concentric circular track connected in series. The ferrite plates and the insulating layers adopted in the simulation model are in a circular shape, instead of in a square shape in the trans- former prototype. The ferrite plates and the insulating layers may be made of any conventional materials. A.

The high relative permeability, u,, of the ferrite material guides the magnetic field along and inside the ferrite plates. In the transformer prototype, 4F1 ferrite material is used though any other conventional ferrite material cold also be used. The relative permeability of the 4F1 material is about 80.

Thus, at the boundary,\n\nA PCB transformer using ferrite plates coated with con- ductive sheets formed of copper as a shielding (FIGS. 3(a) and (b)) has been fabricated. The size of the copper sheets is the same as that of the ferrite plate but its thickness is merely 70 wm. Thin copper sheets are required to minimize the eddy current flowing in the z-direction, which may diminish the tangential component of the H-field.\n\nBy -Ba, \u4eba\n\nB,, and B,, are the normal component (in z-direction) of the magnetic flux density in the ferrite plate free space, respectively.\n\nFrom (2),\n\nBased on the integral form of the Maxwell equation,\n\nMyHF p= Hoon\n\n2 \u4e0b 9 4g ia oF (4)\n\nAy, =H4 Hi, (3)\n\nFrom (3), at the boundary between the ferrite plate and free space, the normal component of the magnetic field intensity free space can be much higher than that in the ferrite plate\n\nassuming that the displacement current is zero and current on the ferrite-copper boundary is very small negligible, the tangential component of the magnetic field\n\nof a the\n\nPCB\n\npresent\n\nthe\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nin\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nTABLE I\n\nB.\n\nand\n\nthe and\n\nUS 6,888,438 B2\n\nS\n\nintensity is continuous acroSS the boundary between the\n\nferrite plate and free Space.

Alternatively, the incident field ban be replaced with magnetic field when the barrier is removed.\n\nConsider the differential form of the Maxwell equation at the ferrite-copper boundary,\n\nMagnetic field intensity generated from the PCB trans- formers with and without shielding has been simulated with FEM 2D simulator and measured with a precision EMC scanner. In the field simulation, the primary side of the transformer is excited with a 3 MHz 3A current source. However, the output of the magnetic field transducer in the EMC scanner will be clipped when the amplitude of the high-frequency field intensity is too large. Thus, the 3 MHz 3A current source is approximated as a small signal (0.1A) 3 MHz source superimposed into a 3A DC source because the field transducer cannot sense DC source. In the mea- surement setup, a magnetic field transducer for detecting vertical magnetic field is located at 5 mm below the PCB transformer.\n\nthe magnetic field intensity can be expressed as\n\n2 1 \u5df2 H=-\u2014 YX \u4e86 our\n\n25\n\nwhere w, 4 and o are the angular frequency, permeability and conductivity of the medium, respectively. Because cop- per is a good conductor (o=5.80x107 S/m) and the operating frequency of the PCB transformer is very high (a few megahertz), from (7), the magnetic field intensity, H, inside the copper sheet is extremely small. Accordingly, the normal component of the H-field inside the copper sheet is also small. Furthermore, from (3), at the ferrite-copper boundary, the normal component of the H-field inside the ferrite plate is 80 times less than that inside the copper sheet. As a result, the normal component of the H-field inside the ferrite plate can be suppressed drastically.\n\nPCB Transformer Without Shielding\n\nThe magnetic field intensity of the PCB transformer without any form of shielding and loading has been simu- lated and its R-Z plane is shown in FIG. 9. From the simulated result, the magnetic field intensity, at R=-O mm and Z=5 mm, is about 30 dBA/m. The measured magnetic intensity, in z-direction, is shown in FIG. 10. The white square and the white parallel lines in FIG. 10 indicate the positions of transformer and the current carrying leads of the transformer primary terminals, respectively. The output of the magnetic field transducer, at 5 mm beneath the centre of the transformer, is about 130 dBuV.\n\nintensity vector plot of the PCB transformer shielded with ferrite plates and conductive sheets has been simulated and is shown in FIG. 7. The tangential (H,) and normal (H,) components of magnetic field intensity near the conductive sheet, at R=1 mm, are plotted in FIG. 8. From FIG. 8, the tangential H-field (H,) is about 23 dB and approximately continuous at the boundary. The normal component of the H-field (H.) in conductive sheet is suppressed to about 8 dB and that inside the ferrite plate is about -7.5 dB at the boundary. Therefore, the normal component of the H-field is, merely about 0.09% of the resultant H-field inside the ferrite plate at the boundary. Accordingly, at the ferrite- conductive sheet boundary, the H-field is nearly tangential and confined inside in the ferrite plate. Besides, the normal component of the H-field emitted into the conductive sheet and the free space can be neglected in practical terms. Since the normal component of the H-field emitted into the con- ductive sheet is very small, the eddy current loss due to the H-field is also very small. This phenomenon is verified by the energy efficiency measurements of the ferrite-shielded PCB transformers with and without conductive sheets described below. As a result, the use of ferrite plates covered with conductive sheets is an effective way to shield the magnetic field generated from the transformer windings\n\nB. PCB Transformer Shielded With Ferrite Plates\n\nThe simulated magnetic field intensity of a PCB trans- former shielded with ferrite plates alone, under no load condition, is shown in FIG. 11. The simulated result shows that the magnetic field intensity, at R=0 mm and Z=5 mm, is about 28 dBA/m. The measured magnetic intensity, in z-direction, is shown in FIG. 12. The output of the magnetic field transducer, at 5 mm beneath the centre of the transformer, is about 128 dBuV. Therefore, with the use of 4F1 ferrite plates, the shielding effectiveness (SE), from the simulated result, is\n\nSE=2x(30-28)=4 dB\n\nThe shielding effectiveness obtained from measurements\n\nis\n\nSE=2x(130-128)=4 dB\n\nBoth simulation and experimental results shows that the of the 4F1 ferrite plates can reduce the magnetic field emitted from the transformer by 4 dB (about 2.5 times).

The H-field generated from the transformer windings is confined in the ferrite plates. The use of thin conductive sheets is to direct the magnetic field in parallel to the ferrite plates so that the normal component of the magnetic field emitting into the conduc- tive sheet can be suppressed significantly.

The difference mainly comes from the magnetic field emitted from the current carrying leads of the transformer.

Performance comparison, including shielding effectiveness and energy efficiency, of the PCB transformers shielded in accordance with embodiments of the invention, conductive sheets and ferrite plates has been accomplished. Both simulation and measurement results show that the use of ferrite plates covered with conductive sheets has the greatest shielding effectiveness (SE) of 34 dB (2512 times) and 28 dB (631 times) respectively, whereas the SE of using only ferrite plates is about 4 dB (2.5 times). Addition of the conductive sheets on the surfaces the ferrite plates does not significantly diminish the transformer energy efficiency.

FIG. 17 shows the measured energy efficiency of the four PCB transformers with 100@ resistive load. In the PCB transformer shielded with only conductive sheets, a layer of insulating sheet of 0.684 mm thickness is used to isolate the transformer winding and the conductive sheets. From FIG. 17, energy efficiency of the transformers increases with increasing frequency. The transformer shielded with copper sheets only has the lowest energy efficiency among the four transformers.
