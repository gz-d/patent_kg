Mechanical properties of a cell nucleus, such as the elasticity and viscosity, are known to be important factors that affect cancer cells development and migration. Existing studies on cells have revealed that cancerous cells are usually more deformable comparing to benign cells, thereby promoting migration of cancerous cells to other parts of the body to establish new colonies. Hence, cell stiffness has been con- sidered an effective biomarker for certain cancers such as lung carcinoma and ovarian cancer.\n\n[0003] Accordingly, it is important to accurately quantify the mechanical properties of a cell nucleus to advance the understanding of the role of cell mechanics in the develop- ment of diseases. There are various existing methods that are used to quantify mechanical properties of a cell nucleus which involve either assessing an extracted nucleus or an unextracted nucleus (ie. a nucleus contained in a cell). However, mechanical properties of a cell nucleus are diffi- cult to be quantified accurately by existing methods due to some limitations associated with these methods.\n\n[0004] For example, some existing methods may involve process such as mechanical or chemical nuclear extraction that changes the mechanical properties of the nucleus, thereby compromising the reliability of the results obtained from the methods. Also, the results obtained from some of the existing methods may be highly dependent on variables such as the probing positions of the nucleus. Consequently, the mechanical properties quantification using these meth- ods may not be accurate.\n\n[0005] Additionally, some existing methods may require the use of certain techniques, such as atomic force micros- copy indentations or micropipette aspirations, which involve the use of relatively expensive instruments or can only be performed by skilled operators.\n\nA need therefore exists\n\n[0006] to provide a system method that seek to address at least one of the problems above or to provide a useful alternative.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0007] According to a first aspect of the present

DESCRIPTION\n\nEmbodiments of the\n\ninvention disclose\n\n[0057] present a simple and non-destructive single-cell nuclear elasticity quantification system and method to quantify mechanical properties of a cell containing a nucleus and cytoplasm. The mechanical properties include the elastic modulus of the whole cell (denoted as E), the elastic modulus of the nucleus (ie. nuclear modulus, E,,,,.7e2,) and the elastic modulus of the cytoplasm (i.e. cytoplasmic modulus, E,,,.). Notably, the system and method can be applied directly to unattached cells as well as a suspension cell, a non-adherent cell and a dissociated adherent cell. Additionally, the proposed system and method are also capable of cell mechanical properties quantification in blood samples. The system and method can also be applied directly to an extracted nucleus to calculate the elastic modulus of the extracted nucleus, considering that an extracted nucleus generally behaves as a homoge-\n\nneous soft sphere.\n\n[0058] The system and method involve examining an individual live whole cell captured along a microfluidic channel to obtain parameters of the cell when it is deformed under two different deformation levels. The cell deformation is achieved by driving a live whole cell along the microflu- idic channel at a constant pressure such that the cell is clamped by the narrowing sidewalls of the microfluidic channel. Different deformation levels can be achieved by varying the pressure applied to the cell through an inlet of the microfluidic channel.\n\n[0059] The elastic moduli of the whole cell at the two different deformation levels are calculated based on the parameters of the whole cell under the two different defor- mation levels. It is found that the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively large cell deformation is significantly larger than the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively small cell deformation. This implies that\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nthe increase in the elastic modulus or \u2018modulus jump\u2019 is attributed to the nuclear modulus. In other words, the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively large cell deformation is contributed by the cytoplasmic and nuclear elasticities, while the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively small cell deformation is contributed by the cytoplasmic elasticity only. Equations are developed based on a representative hyperelastic Tatara model describing cell mechanics to decouple contributions of the cytoplasmic and nuclear elasticities to the elastic modulus of the cell in respect of the relatively large cell deformation, thereby quantifying the nuclear modulus and cytoplasmic modulus.\n\n[0060] FIG. 1A illustrates a diagram of a microfluidic device 102 used for quantifying mechanical properties of a cell in accordance with an example embodiment. The micro- fluidic device 102 has an inlet 104 to receive a sample and an outlet 106 to dispense the sample. The microfluidic device 102 further includes two arrays 108 of confining microfluidic channels with forty microfluidic channels in each array. The microfluidic channels can be used to capture the cell for quantifying mechanical properties of the cell.\n\nof the cell is driven from\n\nair filter 110\n\n[0061] Asample an to a fluid pump (shown as an air compressor 112 in FIG. 1A), which applies pressure to drive the sample into the inlet 104 of the microfluidic device 102. The pressure applied to the sample can be regulated by a pressure reducing regulator 114. It should be noted that the flow resistance in a micro- fluidic channel will increase significantly after a cell enters the microfluidic channel, thereby restricting other cells to enter the same microfluidic channel. As a result, other cells in the sample will move to other unoccupied microfluidic channels. Accordingly, nearly eighty individual cells can be examined in the microfluidic device 102 in each experiment.\n\n[0062] Also, it is noted that the pressure distributed on the microfluidic channels account for over 99% pressure differ- ence between the inlet 104 and outlet 106 of the microfluidic device 102 (see description below with respect to FIGS. 11A and 11B for further details). Thus, the driving pressures applied on the microfluidic device 102 can be used in calculations as the pressure differences between inlets and outlets of the microfluidic channels.\n\n[0063]\n\nFIG.\n\n1B illustrates\n\na diagram of a microscopic\n\nimage of a deformed whole cell 116 captured in a micro- fluidic channel 118 in the microfluidic device 102 of FIG. 1A. Amicroscopy device is configured to obtain image data of the whole cell 116 captured in the microfluidic channel 118. Each microfluidic channel 118 has a linear confined shape, an inlet 120 configured to receive the cell and an outlet 122 in fluid communication with the inlet 120. The microfluidic channel 116 has a varying width configured to deform the cell to multiple deformation levels. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1B, the microfluidic channel 118 tapers from the inlet 120 towards the outlet 122 such that the width decreases at a consistent rate from its inlet W,,, to its outlet W,,,,. W,, should be large enough to cover the size range of the whole cell 116, whereas W,,,, should be small enough to capture the extracted cell nuclei of the whole cell 116. In an embodiment, the inlet 120 has a width of 10 hm-s0 hm and the outlet 122 has a width of 1 um-10 wm. A cell or nucleus deforms at a continually increasing rate along the microfluidic channel 118 due to the reducing width of the\n\nmicrofluidic channel 118.\n\n[0064] The microfluidic channel 118 has a taper angle 6 that reflects the rate of change of the width of the micro-\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\nfluidic channel 118 along the microfluidic channel length Lo, direction. The taper angle @ should be a relatively small angle and can be calculated using the equation:\n\n97tan (Wig Woyp)(Lerannet)) @\n\n[0065] The position of the whole cell 116 is determined with reference to its distance from the inlet 120 of the microfluidic channel 118 which can be directly observed. under the microscopy device and is called \u2018penetration length L\u2019. A processor receives image data of the whole cell 116 from the microscopy device and, based on the image data obtained by the microscopy device, the processor determines the parameters associated with the deformed whole cell 116 at a first position and a second position along the microfluidic channel 118.\n\n[0066] The penetration length L determines the deformed length Wu along the microfluidic channel width direction. The deformed cell length Wy, can be calcu- lated using the equation:\n\ncell\n\nW seporm=\u00a5 ora Win channel Lt Win (2)\n\n[0067] The penetration length L also affects the cell length Lyeform Along the channel length direction which can be directly measured in the image captured by the microfluidic device 102. Based on the assumption that the deformed cell would have no change in its volume, the diameter D of the cell at its undeformed state can be calculated using the equation:\n\n@)\n\n[0068] It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the microfluidic channel 118 may include different shape, size and dimension. Any microfluidic channel that can releasably capture and deform cells in a non-destructive manner can be used in the quantification of the mechanical properties system and method as disclosed herein.\n\n[0069] The microfluidic device is constructed such that at least the area in which the cell is captured within the microfluidic channels can be viewed and imaged by an imaging device. The imaging device may include, but not limited to, a microscope, an imager and a camera. The sample may be a compressed air or gas source.\n\n[0070] FIG. 2A illustrates laminar flow simulation results ofa single microfluidic channel containing a captured cell in accordance with an example embodiment. The flow along the confining microfluidic channel is laminar with a very small Reynolds number (<<1), given the micro-scale of the dimensions of the microfluidic channel. The simulation is calculated using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a and a repre- sentative normalized pressure distribution of the microflu- idic channel is shown in FIG. 2A.\n\n[0071] FIG. 2B illustrates a graph showing the effective drag force on cells of various sizes captured in a microfluidic channel based on the simulation results of FIG. 2A. The pressure distribution around a cell with a size ranging from 6 hm to 20 lm against the penetration length along the microfluidic channel is analyzed. The surface stress around the cell is integrated to obtain the effective drag force on the captured cell and the computed drag forces is plotted in the line graph in FIG. 2B.\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\n[0072] As shown in FIG. 2B, the drag force scales linearly with the driving pressure because of the laminar flow characteristics. Therefore, under a steady driving pressure, the values of the penetration length L and cell diameter D can be used to calculate the drag force over the captured cell based on the numerical interpolation of values plotted on the line graph of FIG. 2B.\n\nFIG. 3A illustrates diagrams of a captured whole\n\n[0073]\n\ncell 302 in a microfluidic channel 304 under a small defor- mation in accordance with an example embodiment. FIG. 3B illustrates diagrams of a captured whole cell 302 in a microfluidic channel 304 under a large deformation in accordance with the same embodiment shown in FIG. 3A. A whole cell 302 includes two major cell components: cyto- plasm 306 and nucleus 308. Considering that elasticity of the nucleus 308 is often higher than that of the cytoplasm 306 in the whole cell 302, modulus difference (denoted as E\\ cleus) between the nuclear modulus Eee and the cytoplasmic modulus \u4e86 Er\u3002 is therefore \u5df2, E) weteus: Contributions of the nuclear modulus E,,,,.iers am the cytoplasmic modulus Eve to the elastic modulus of the whole cell E under the small and large deformations are presented in FIG. 3A (small deformation) and FIG. 3B (large\n\ndeformation).\n\n[0074] The processor calculates the elastic modulus of the whole cell E under the small and large deformations by considering a force balanced state of the captured whole cell 302 and the hyperelastic Tatara model using the following equation:\n\nei + OD. - 8D? + D2 ( op? ] (4) 4 De om (8D? + 2D2\u00a5\u00b0?

To resolve the values of the nuclear modulus E,,,iexs and the cytoplasmic modulus E.,,., a simplified physical cell structure consisting of only the\n\n(6)\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\ncytoplasm 306 and the nucleus 308 is adopted to represent the key biomechanical properties of the captured whole cell 302.\n\n[0079] The whole cell elasticity measured under the large cell deformation can then be considered as the nucleus and the cytoplasmic body being compressed simultaneously inside the microfluidic channel 304. In other words, the \u2018modulus jump\u2019 is attributed to the nuclear deformation.\n\n[0080] According to the force balance as shown in FIGS. and 3B, the compressive force is related to the drag force the following equation:\n\n3A by\n\nF azag OF compress!

Therefore, considering compressive forces Fi and F, are caused by the driving pressures of P,=100 Pa and P,=400 Pa, respectively, the compressive forces Fi and F, can be calculated with the following equations:\n\nPEP XE * Dects WK Deets WE cototK Daetouse WE \u2018nucteus (10)\n\nFIEPXE* Dots W2)-K Desi W2)E cy20t K Drrctouse WE \u2018nucteus (11)\n\nwhere\n\n[0083] W, and W, are the deformed particle width at the driving pressure of P, and P,, respectively.\n\n[0084] D.,,, is the diameter of the cell and Deusisthe diameter of the nucleus. D,.7 and Does at the deformed state of the cell and nucleus respectively can be measured from the image captured by the micros- copy device, Do and Dreus at the undeformed state of the cell and nucleus respectively can be calculated using the Equation (3) above.\n\n[0085] Considering the relation as described in Equation the two \u2018cytoplasmic\u2019 K value in Equation (10) can obtained using the following equations:\n\n(9),\n\nbe\n\nKF (EP, Deen) (2)\n\nKF (EP Dyucteus V0) (13)\n\n[0086] The two K values in Equation (11) can also be obtained in the same manner using Equations (12) and (13) above.

Considering that dimensions of a microfluidic channel are largely dependent on sizes of the target particles, the diameters of whole cells and nuclei are measured for both the NP460 and NPC43 cells. For mea- surement of whole cells, the cells are resuspended by typsinization and their diameters are quantified under a bright-field microscope. The diameters measured are 13.842SD 1.99 um (N=90) for NP460 cells and 14.18+SD\n\n2.54 hm (N=103) for NPC43 cells.\n\n[0089] On the other hand, the fluorescence staining of Hoechst 33342 is applied to visualize the nuclei in whole cells and the chemically extracted nuclei (See description about \u201cnuclear extraction\u201d below in the \u201csupplementary information\u201d section for further details). Notably, it can be observed that the resuspended cells and nuclei are typically in a spherical shape. The diameters of these nuclei are measured for both cell types, results of which are explained in further detail below with respect to FIG. 4B.\n\n[0090]\n\nFIG. 4B illustrates a bar graph showing diameters\n\nof nuclei within NPC43 and NP460 whole cells (unextracted nuclei) and the extracted nuclei of NPC43 and NP460 cells. 3D shapes of Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei of extracted and unextracted NPC43 and NP460 cells are observed using laser confocal microscopy to further verify the nuclear shapes in 3D view (see description below with respect to FIGS. 10A, 10B for further details). Generally, NPC43 cells have a larger nuclear diameter (unextracted: 11.18+SD 1.62 jum, N=40; chemically extracted: 11.274SD 1.75 tum, N=40) comparing to those of NP460 cells (unextracted: 9.86+SD 55 yum, N=40; chemically extracted: 10.18+SD 1.29 um, N=40) as summarised in the bar graph of FIG. 4B. Based on these measured whole cell and nuclear sizes, it is configured that the suitable dimensions of the microfluidic channels are W,,=30 um, Wo Wn, Lo 300 hm and 6=2.5\u00b0. Additionally, the suitable channel height is 50 hm to avoid unwanted physical contacts of the captured cells/nuclei with\n\nthe roof and floor of the microfluidic channel.\n\nQuantification of Nuclear Elasticity\n\n[0091] FIG. SA illustrates microscopic images of a naso- pharyngeal epithelial cell NP460 captured in a microfluidic channel 502 under driving pressures of 100 Pa and 400 Pa. FIG. 5B illustrates microscopic images of a nasopharyngeal cancerous cell NPC43 captured in a microfluidic channel 502 under driving pressures of 100 Pa and 400 Pa.\n\n[0092] A non-destructive quantification of the nuclear moduli of NP460 cell 504 and NPC43 cell 506 is imple-\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\nmented using the microfluidic channel 502. The cell nuclei\n\nare visualized by pre-staining them with fluorescence Hoechst 33342 and the cell density is diluted to a sufficiently low level (about 104 nuclei/mL) for avoiding cell aggrega- tion along the microfluidic channel 502. The cells 504, 506, are injected into the microfluidic device with a driving pressure of 100 Pa, and microscopic images of the captured. cells 504, 506 in the microfluidic channel 502 are taken to obtain parameters F,, Wi Do rz and De Next, the driving pressure is increased to 400 Pa and microscopic images of the captured cells 504, 506 are taken again to obtain parameters F, and W,. Afterward, the driving pres- sure is increased to 1 kPa to recollect all the captured cells 504, 506 at the outlet of the microfluidic device for any\n\nfurther analysis.\n\n[0093] FIG. 5C illustrates a bar graph showing the whole cell elasticity of NP460 cell 504 and NPC43 cell 506. The parameters obtained from the microscopic images are used. to calculate the elastic modulus of the whole cells NP460 and NPC43 using Equations (3)-(7) above. As shown in the bar graph, the elastic modulus of the cells under driving pressure of 400 Pa are significantly higher than the elastic modulus of the cells under driving pressure of 100 Pa, confirming the modulus jumps for both NP460 and NPC43 cells.\n\nmicroscopic\n\nimages\n\nillustrates\n\n[0094]\n\nFIG.\n\n5D\n\ndeformed extracted nuclei of NP460 and NPC43 cells cap- tured in a microfluidic channel 502 (top) and key parameters in the deformed extracted nuclei 508 (bottom). It is known that factors such as nucleus extraction procedures, the cell viability and the surrounding conditions may alter nuclear properties. For comparison purposes, an experiment is con- ducted to quantify elastic modulus of chemically extracted. nuclei of NP460 and NPC43 cells using the microfluidic channel 502. The experimental procedures are similar to the method for quantifying mechanical properties of whole cells, except that only one driving pressure level is applied. As the extracted nuclei are smaller than the whole cells in size, the applied pressure level is set at 300 Pa to deform the extracted nuclei. The nuclear moduli are then calculated directly using Equation (4) above. The elastic modulus values of the extracted nuclei are 4.25+SE 0.31 kPa (N=30) for NP460 cell and 3.34+SE 0.15 kPa (N=40) for NPC43\n\nof\n\ncell.\n\n[0095] FIG. 5E illustrates a bar graph showing the values of nuclear moduli E,,,,.ze2- obtained based on parameters of the chemically extracted nuclei and the values of nuclear moduli E,,,,ciear obtained based on parameters of the whole cells (unextracted nuclei). E.,,. and Nyvcieus are obtained using Equations (10)-(14). As shown in the bar graph, Eeyo=0.72SE 0.03 kPa and E,,pezeus=4-99+SE 0.62 kPa for NPC43 cells (N=48), and E,,,,-0.892SE 0.05 kPa, \u4e5f =6.87+SE 0.68 kPa for NP460 cells (N=47). \u2018nucleus:\n\n[0096] By comparing the corresponding results for extracted and unextracted nuclei, it is noted that the extracted nuclei generally have smaller elastic moduli than unextracted nuclei. Such difference implicates that the nuclear properties may be altered by the chemical nucleus extraction procedures.\n\n[0097] FIG. 6A illustrates cell viability test results of cells recollected from the quantification procedure (labelled as \u2018Recollected\u2019) and cells used as a control group (labelled as\n\na\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\n\u2018Control\u2019). FIG. 6B illustrates a bar graph showing the live cell percentage in the recollected cells and the control group of FIG. 6A.\n\nTo examine cell viability after the nuclear elasticity\n\n[0098]\n\nquantification procedure, cell live/dead assay is performed on recollected cells after the procedure and cells in a control group (e.g. cells that are not injected into the microfluidic channel). The LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit is applied to examine the cell viability (see description about \u201ccell viabil- ity test\u201d below in the \u201csupplementary information\u201d section or further details). For examining cell viability on recol- lected cells after the quantification procedure, a tube is connected to the microfluidic device outlet to collect cells, ollowed by mixing the prepared LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit in the recollected cells. Similarly, LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit is mixed in trypsinized cell suspensions to stain cells in the control group. From the cell viability staining results shown in FIG. 6A, it is noted that only few dead cells are found for both recollected cells and the control group. From the bar graph shown in FIG. 6B, it is noted that high ive cell percentage is maintained after the proposed quan-\n\ntification procedure. FIG. 7A illustrates immunofluorescence\n\n[0099] images Lamin A/C expressions for nuclei in NPC43 and NP460 cells (unextracted nuclei) and the chemically extracted nuclei of NPC43 and NP460 cells. Possible causes of reduced moduli for the extracted nuclei are examined using immunofluorescence staining (see description about \u201cFluo- rescence Staining\u201d below in the \u201csupplementary informa- tion\u201d for further details) for the nuclear Lamin A/C expres- sions, as it is known for its contribution to nuclear deformability and direct relations with nuclear elasticity. To make the staining images comparable for different cases, parameters (e.g. cell density before staining, incident laser intensity in imaging etc.) used in immunofluorescence stain- ing and confocal microscopy imaging are controlled. The stained fluorescence intensity for unextracted and extracted nuclei are quantified based on the captured microscopic\n\nimages.\n\n[0100] FIG. 7B illustrates a bar graph showing the total fluorescence intensity of the unextracted and extracted nuclei. It is shown that the extracted nuclei have signifi- cantly lower Lamin A/C expression, suggesting that the nuclear extraction process may reduce the nuclear mem- brane integrity and the corresponding stiffness. The Lamin A/C expression of nuclei of NPC43 (1.36x105+SE 0.22x 105 A.U) is lower than Lamin A/C expression of nuclei in NP460 (1.89x105+SE 0.26105 A.U.), corresponding with the measured nuclear moduli. Accordingly, the non-destruc- tive quantification procedure in the example embodiments provides more accurate results for quantifying mechanical properties of cells.\n\nCell Classification\n\n[0101] FIG. 8A illustrates scatter plot graphs for cell classification displaying values of whole cell elastic moduli against cell diameter under pressure of 100 Pa (left) and 400 Pa (right). Classification of NPC43 and NP460 cells using different measured physical properties are performed. Qua- dratic Discriminate Analysis (QDA) is suitable to discrimi- nate between medical conditions that symptomatically are very similar, such as alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease. In particular, QDA is effective for situations where ratio of sample number to variables count is large. The\n\nof\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\ncell-type classification using measured whole cell elasticity and cell diameter under a driving pressure of 100 Pa which achieves small cell deformations is shown in FIG. 8A (left). The boundary line is computed based on QDA as an opti- mized separating curve between properties clusters of the two cell-types. To quantify the classification performance, the accuracy (A), sensitivity values for NP460 (S-NP) and NPC43 (S-NPC), and the overall cell-type sensitivity (S) are considered. For the case of small cell deformations, the classification parameters are A=63.2%, S-NP=78.3% and S=S-NPC=58.3%. The procedure is repeated for cell quan- tification under 400 Pa driving pressure to achieve large cell deformations as shown in FIG. 8A (right), with the classi- fication parameters are A=60.6%, S-S-NP=57.9% and SNPC=64.8%, which do not show any improvements com- pared with the classification under the pressure of 100 Pa.\n\nscatter plot graphs for cell\n\nillustrates\n\n[0102]\n\nFIG.\n\n8B\n\nclassifications displaying values of cytoplasmic elasticity against cell diameter (left) and nuclear elasticity versus nuclear diameter (right). QDA is performed for both cyto- plasmic elasticity against cell diameter and nuclear elasticity against nuclear diameter. The classification parameters for the cytoplasmic properties are A=63.0%, S-NP=68.8% and S=S-NPC=60.0%; and the classification parameters for the nuclear properties are A=79.1%, S=S-NP=74.0% and S-NPC=86.4%. These results suggest that the classification accuracy using the elasticity values related to cell nucleus (A=79.1%) is higher than using the whole cell elasticity under both pressure levels (A<65%), implying that the nuclear elasticity values are more relevant in classifying cel. properties. To further confirm nuclear elasticity differences are distinct in these two cell lines, we counted their nuclear diameters and nuclear elasticities distributions for compari- son (see description below with respect to FIGS. 12A and 12B for further details), results of which suggest that nuclear\n\nelasticity is a significant factor in classifications.\n\n[0103] FIG. 9 depicts an exemplary computing device 900, hereinafter interchangeably referred to as a computer system 900, where one or more such computing devices 900 may be used to quantifying mechanical properties of a cell. The following description of the computing device 900 is provided by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting.\n\n[0104] As shown in FIG. 9, the example computing device 900 includes a processor 907 for executing software rou- tines. Although a single processor is shown for the sake of clarity, the computing device 900 may also include a multi- processor system. The processor 907 is connected to a communication infrastructure 906 for communication with other components of the computing device 900. The com- munication infrastructure 906 may include, for example, a communications bus, cross-bar, or network.\n\n[0105] The software routines, or computer programs, may be stored in memory and be executable by the processor to cause the computer system 900 to: receive, from the imaging device, image data of the cell deformed within the micro- fluidic channel at a first deformation level and a second deformation level different from the first deformation level; determine, based on the image data, parameters associated with the deformed cell at the first deformation level and the second deformation level; calculate, using the parameters, a first elastic modulus of the cell at the first deformation level and a second elastic modulus of the cell at the second deformation level; and calculate, using the first and second\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nelastic moduli, a nuclear modulus of the nucleus and cytoplasmic modulus of the cytoplasm.\n\n[0106]\n\nThe computing device 900 further includes a main\n\nmemory 908, such as a random access memory (RAM), and a secondary memory 910.

The removable storage medium 977 may include magnetic tape, optical disk, non-volatile memory storage medium, or the like, which is read by and written to by removable storage drive 917. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), the removable storage medium 977 includes a computer readable storage medium having stored therein computer executable program code instructions and/\n\nor data.\n\n[0107] In an alternative implementation, the secondary memory 910 may additionally or alternatively include other similar means for allowing computer programs or other instructions to be loaded into the computing device 900. Such means can include, for example, a removable storage unit 922 and an interface 950.

[0108] The computing device 900 also includes at least\n\none communication interface 927. The communication interface 927 allows software and data to be transferred between computing device 900 and external devices via a communication path 926. In various embodiments of the inventions, the communication interface 927 permits data to be transferred between the computing device 900 and a data communication network, such as a public data or private data communication network. The communication interface 927 may be used to exchange data between different com- puting devices 900 which such computing devices 900 form part an interconnected computer network. Examples of a communication interface 927 can include a modem, a net- work interface (such as an Ethernet card), a communication port (such as a serial, parallel, printer, GPIB, IEEE 1394, RJ45, USB), an antenna with associated circuitry and the like. The communication interface 927 may be wired or may be wireless. Software and data transferred via the commu- nication interface 927 are in the form of signals which can be electronic, electromagnetic, optical or other signals capable of being received by communication interface 927. These signals are provided to the communication interface\n\nvia the communication path 926.\n\n[0109] As shown in FIG. 9, the computing device 900 further includes a display interface 902 which performs operations for rendering images to an associated display 904 and an audio interface 952 for performing operations for playing audio content via associated speaker(s) 957.\n\na\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\n[0110]\n\nAs used herein, the term \u201ccomputer program prod-\n\nuct\u201d may refer, in part, to removable storage medium 977, removable storage unit 922, a hard disk installed in storage drive 912, or a carrier wave carrying software over com- munication path 926 (wireless link or cable) to communi- cation interface 927. Computer readable storage media refers to any non-transitory, non-volatile tangible storage medium that provides recorded instructions and/or data to the computing device 900 for execution and/or processing. Examples of such storage media include magnetic tape, CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-ray\u2122 Disc, a hard disk drive, a ROM or integrated circuit, a solid state storage drive (such as a USB flash drive, a flash memory device, a solid state drive or a memory card), a hybrid drive, a magneto-optical disk, or a computer readable card such as a PCMCIA card and the like, whether or not such devices are internal or external of the computing device 900.

Computer programs can also be received via the communication interface 927. Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computing device 900 to perform one or more features of embodiments discussed herein. In various embodiments, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor 907 to perform features of the above-described embodiments. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer system 900.\n\n[0113] Software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into the computing device 900 using the removable storage drive 917, the storage drive 912, or the interface 950. The computer program product may be a non-transitory computer readable medium. Alternatively, the computer program product may be downloaded to the com- puter system 900 over the communications path 926. The software, when executed by the processor 907, causes the computing device 900 to perform functions of embodiments described herein.\n\n[0114] It is to be understood that the embodiment of FIG. 9 is presented merely by way of example. Therefore, in some embodiments one or more features of the computing device 900 may be omitted. Also, in some embodiments, one or more features of the computing device 900 may be com- bined together. Additionally, in some embodiments, one or\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nmore features of the computing device 900 may be split or more component parts.\n\none\n\n[0115] When the computing device 900 is configured to quantify mechanical properties of a cell, the computing system 900 will have a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon an application which when executed causes the computing system 900 to perform steps comprising: receive, from the imaging device, image data of the cell deformed within the microfluidic channel at a first deformation level and a second deformation level different from the first deformation level; determine, based on the image data, parameters associated with the deformed cell at the first deformation level and the second deformation level; calculate, using the parameters, a first elastic modulus of the cell at the first deformation level and a second elastic modulus of the cell at the second deformation level; and calculate, using the first and second elastic moduli, a nuclear modulus of the nucleus and a cytoplasmic modulus of the cytoplasm.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\n3D Nuclear Shapes of NP460 and NPC43 Cells\n\n[0116] FIG. 104A illustrates a 3D view of a Hoechst 33342 stained NPC43 cell and the cross-sectional views across x-, y- and z-planes. FIG. 10B illustrates a 3D view of a Hoechst 33342 stained NPC460 cell and the cross-sectional views across x-, y- and z-planes. Laser confocal microscopy is used to obtain 3D images of Hoechst 33342 stained nuclei to further verify whether nuclei of NP460 and NPC43 cells are in substantially spherical shapes. Briefly, a fluorescent nucleus is scanned from the top to bottom across multiple planes (typically ~100 planes scanned) on a laser confocal microscope and 3D view of stained nucleus is generated. As shown in FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B, nuclei of both NPC43 and NP460 cells are in substantially spherical shapes. Accord- ingly, performing the measurements with the assumption that of NPC43 and NP460 cells and nuclei are soft spheres result in accurate outcome and less\n\nmore\n\nerrors.\n\nEffective Pressure Difference on Single Confining Microfluidic Channels\n\n[0117] FIG. 11A illustrates diagram of the flow sections in the whole microfluidic device. To study the effective pres- sure difference driven on a single confining microfluidic channel, the total microfluidic device is divided into several flow sections. As illustrated in FIG. 11A, the whole device can be considered as consisting of a main flow section (Rm), four bypass channels (R1, R2, R3, R4), and a downstream outflow channel (Rout).\n\n[0118] FIG. 11B illustrates a circuit model of flow resis- tances distributions for flow sections. The effective pressure differences on each flow section can be calculated by con- sidering circuit model of flow resistances. As shown in FIG. 11B, the flow resistance of the whole microfluidic device can be considered as a main flow section connected in parallel with four bypass channels and then connected in series with an outflow channel. The flow resistances can be calculated by:\n\n(15) > H El\n\ninto\n\nApr 21, 2022\n\nwhere\n\n[0119] Ris the flow resistance of flow section\n\n[0120] p is the average pressure in flow section\n\n[0121] S is integrated flow rate in flow section\n\n[0122] After implementing COMSOL Multiphysics (Burlington, Mass.) to calculate average pressures and flow rates for every flow section, flow resistances of each flow section can be obtained by using Equation (15) as shown table below:\n\nthe\n\n5.2a\n\nin\n\nTABLE S1\n\nCalculated flow resistances of every flow section in the microfiuidic device.

After considering the pressure distri- butions according to the flow resistances, the effective pressure difference of the main flow section is\n\nR Pag = Pave Bp ey = 99.6% Pai\n\nwhere\n\n[0125] Peris the effective pressure difference of the main flow section\n\n[0126] P.,,:,. is the driving pressure applied on the whole microfluidic device\n\n[0127] Since every confining microfluidic channel is con- nected in parallel with the main flow section, the pressure difference between inlets and outlets is similar to the flow section pressure. Therefore, the pressure applied to the cells are similar to the pressure difference between inlets and outlets of microfluidic channels.\n\nNuclear Size and Elasticity Distributions of Measured. NP460 and NPC43 Cells\n\n[0128] FIG. 12A illustrates bar graphs showing nuclear diameter distributions of NP460 and NPC43 cells. FIG. 12B illustrates bar graphs showing nuclear elasticity distributions NP460 and NPC43 cells.\n\nof\n\n[0129] To discover the feasibility of classifying NPC43 cells from NP460 cells using nuclear diameters and elas- ticities, the nuclear diameter distributions and nuclear elastic moduli distributions are firstly counted separately. As shown in FIGS. 12A and 128, it is obvious that significant distri- bution difference can be found between two cell lines in both nuclear diameter and nuclear elasticity. For nuclear diameter distributions, NP460 cells centralize in the group ranging from 8 jum to 12 hm while NPC43 cells tend to distribute in\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\ngroup ranging from 12 hm to 14 um. If nuclear diameter value of 12 hm is taken as the nuclear size separating boundary, there will be 64.6% NPC43 cells in the \u2018larger\u2019 domain and 87.2% NP460 cells in the \u2018smaller\u2019 domain. When considering the nuclear elasticity, majority of mea- sured NPC43 cells have nuclear elasticities ranging from 2 kPa to 4 kPa, while a large number of measured NP460 cells have nuclear elasticity ranging from 4 kPa to 6 kPa. If nuclear elastic modulus value of 4 kPa is taken as the nuclear stiffness separating boundary, there will be 62.5% NPC43 cells in \u2018softer\u2019 domain and 78.7% NP460 cells in \u2018stiffer\u2019 domain.\n\nDevice Fabrication\n\nThe microfluidic device is fabricated mainly based\n\n[0130]\n\non soft photolithography, with a two-step replica molding of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for transferring high aspect- ratio microstructures of a silicon mold to a PDMS substrate. The silicon mold master is manufactured by firstly pattern- ing positive photoresist (AZ5214, AZ Electronic Materials, Branchburg, NI) to a silicon wafer, followed by deep reac- tive ion etching (DRIE) and stripping the photoresist. Next, the first-stage standard replica molding process is applied using the silicon mold master to obtain a PDMS substrate with the reversed microstructures, acting as a negative mold. A molecular layer of trichloro (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluoro- octyl) silane (Sigma-Aldrich) is applied on microstructures of the PDMS mold. The silanized PDMS mold is immersed in deionized water and oven for 1 hour, in order to further remove any excessive silane coating. Another round of the standard replica molding of PDMS is then applied on the silanized PDMS mold. Holes at punched at the inlets and outlets of the PDMS substrate. The micropatterned side of the newly molded PDMS substrate is bonded on a glass slide using oxygen plasma treatment (Plasma Prep II, SPI Sup- plies) such that the microfluidic device is formed. Afterward, cell-repelling pluronics F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich) molecules is applied along the microfluidic channels to eliminate cell\n\nattachment on the channel walls.\n\nCell Culture\n\n[0131] An immortalised human nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line (NP460) and a nasopharyngeal cancer cell line (NPC43) are expanded in culture flasks. NP460 cells are cultured in a cell culture media comprising 50% complete Eplife medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50% complete Defined Keratinocyte-SFM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomycin. NPC43 cells are cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 uM Y27632 dihydrochloride (Alexis), 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomy- cin.\n\n[0132] Both the cell types are cultivated in an incubator at 37\u00b0 C., saturated humidity and 5% CO, in air. Once the cell population reached ~80% confluence, cell passaging is per- formed by applying 0.25 trypsin-EDTA, centrifuging, and resuspending the cells back in fresh media for the subse- quent incubation.\n\nNucleus Extraction\n\n[0133] The cells are trypsinised using 0.25 trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in cell culture media. The cells are then transferred into a pre-chilled syringe tube, centrifuged, and\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\nthe culture media is removed by aspiration. Hypotonic buffer solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl,) and pipetting are applied, followed by placing the syringe tube in ice for 20 min. Next, 10% NP40 detergent (ThermoFisher Scientific) is added to the cell suspension and mixed at 2500 rpm for 15 seconds to chemically extract the cell nuclei. The sample is further processed lm through cell strainers (STEMCELL Technologies Inc.) with a 37 um pore size to remove larger cell debris. After centrifuging and removing the supernatant, which mostly contained the cytoplasmic fraction, the remaining pellet is resuspended to obtain the nuclei.\n\nFluorescence Staining\n\n[0134] Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a concentration of 0.1 pg/ml in FIBS or culture medium is applied for 5 min to stain DNAs in either whole cells and extracted nuclei. Immunofluorescence staining is applied on both intact cells and extracted nuclei. For staining nucleo- skeleton of the intact cells, they are first detached by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). Each population of ~10\u00b0 cells is transferred to a syringe tube for the following steps. The cell sample is centrifuged, followed by aspiration. The cells are then fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) for 15 minutes. Next, cells are washed with PBS. Triton X-100 is added to PBS for a volumetric ratio of 0.3% for 20 minutes to permeabilize the cells. The solution is blocked with 3% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hour to prevent the non-specific bindings in the following steps. The cells are then incubated in a primary antibody (Lamin A/C monoclonal antibody; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a dilution of 1:100 in 3% BSA for 1 hour, followed by washing the cells with the final cell culture media containing BSA. Cells are then incubated in a secondary antibody (Alexa-555; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) at a dilu- tion of 1:1500 in 3% BSA in the dark for 1 hour. After washing the cells twice, they are resuspended for a cell concentration of ~10\u00b0 cells/ml. The staining procedures for nucleoskeleton in the isolated nuclei are the same as for the\n\nintact cells.\n\nCell Viability Test\n\n[0135] The cell viability test of recollected cells and cells in the group is performed by using the LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit (Life Technologies). The prepared staining reagents are added into cell suspensions for 20 min to stain live/dead cells with different fluorescent signals.\n\nImage Capture and Processing\n\n[0136] Bright-field microscopic images are captured under an inverted microscope (TE300, Nikon) equipped with an sCMOS microscope camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor). The captured microscopic images are processed using ImageJ (NIH) for obtaining the key parameters mentioned in this work such as the diameter of cells and nuclei, as well as the penetration Jength in microfluidic channels. The elastic moduli are computed by customized scripts of MATLAB 2017a (Math- Works, MA, USA) written by the inventors. On the other hand, the immunofluorescence images are captured by a confocal laser scanning microscope (ZEISS LSM 880). Fluorescence intensity of captured confocal images is mea- sured using ImageJ.\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nSimulation\n\nSimulation\n\nof the\n\nlaminar\n\nflow\n\n[0137] along a nucleus-containing microfluidic channel is conducted with COMSOL 5.2a (Burlington, Mass.). The pressure distribu- tion around a cell/nucleus with a size ranging from 6 hm to 20 hm at a defined position along the microfluidic channel is analyzed for the case under 1 kPa driving pressure. Briefly, the laminar flow physics is applied to compute the pressure distributions for situations that a cell/nucleus cap- tured in different positions of single confining microfluidic channels. Geometries of a cell/nucleus are directly built at different positions in COMSOL 5.2a. The driving fluid material is selected as water from the material library and the captured cell/nucleus is selected as a blank matter with related properties (density=1,110 kg/m?, dynamic viscos- ity=0.033 Pa's 40). Fine mesh is selected as the fluid dynamic type. Governing equations in laminar flow simu-\n\nlation are:\n\nple WwW [-praVur(Wu) 94\n\np\u00a5-(w)-0\n\nwhere\n\n[0138] is the density of fluid\n\n[0139] uis the fluid velocity\n\n[0140] jr is the fluid dynamic viscosity\n\n[0141] pis the fluid pressure\n\n[0142] Fis the force contributed by the interfacial forces at adjacent interface\n\n[0143] The pressure distributions are computed for each case based on channel inlet pressure of 1 kPa, outlet pressure of 0 kPa and the cell-fluid interface is considered as the interior wall. Next, the effective drag force on the captured cell/nucleus can be calculated by integrating its surface stresses around, which is obtained using \u2018Surface Integra- tion\u2019 in COMSOL 5.2a to integrate the stresses in the flow direction on the captured cell/nucleus surface.\n\nClassification Regime\n\n[0144] Classifications of cells are based on the Quadratic Discriminate Analysis (QDA) regime. The classification of cell lines is calculated according to two cell/nucleus prop- erty variables in QDA. Customized scripts are programmed. to classify scatters of two cell variables and elasticity using MATLAB R2017a (MathWorks) to realize QDA.\n\nEmbodiments of the present invention provide a\n\n[0145]\n\nnon-destructive procedure to quantify mechanical properties of cells using microfluidic devices. The quantification pro- cedure can be used to perform measurements on live whole cell and the cells can be easily recollected thereafter by increasing the driving pressure as the procedure does not destruct the cells structures. This makes further analysis of the cells feasible. Further, the results obtained from the proposed quantification procedure are not sensitive to the measurement positions of the cells since the nuclear mechanical properties are calculated using hyperelastic Tat- ara\u2019s theory by measuring whole cell deformations. Thus, accurate mechanical properties can be obtained using the quantification procedure as disclosed herein. The cost for the microfluidic device is also inexpensive as the microfluidic\n\ndevice is made using polydimethylsiloxane and glass slide.\n\n[0146] It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the numerous variations and/or modifications may be made the present invention as shown in the specific embodi-\n\nthat\n\nto\n\ncell/\n\nart\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\nments without departing from the scope of the invention as broadly described.
