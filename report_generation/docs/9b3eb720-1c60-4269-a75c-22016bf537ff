Firstly, unique conversion of the color may be difficult. Different colors in a system may be converted into the same color of another system. For instance, consider Color A ,Color B ,and Color C in CMYK system, where (c 4, My. Yas Kg-(56 28 28 0). (cm mo ya koj-(390 0 28) and Ce. Me Ye, kw=(45 10 10 20). By using Expression (1), all Color A, Color B and Color C are converted into the same RGB color (1, g, b)=(112 184 184). The reason of causing this bias is because Expression (1) cannot support one-to- one mapping between CMYK and RGB.\n\n[0083] FIG. 4 is a circle-bar graph showing an example result of mixture of multiple colors in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n[0084] The inventors have, through their own research, trials and experiments, devised that color coding methods such as RGB, CMYK, and HSV color methods may be used in different applications. However, owing lack powerful integration frame, these methods may be difficult in some applications. For example, it may be difficult to: i) convert a RGB color into a unique CYMK color; ii) blend multiple HSV colors to paint a coloured object; or iii) print a target RGB color using a number of available CMYK colors.\n\n[0092] Secondly, it may be difficult to obtain a mixture of colors based on these expressions. For example, RGB, CMYK, and HSL/HSV systems do not support mixing of more than two colors, since there are no explicit merge functions or operations. For instance, giving three HSV colors expressed in Expression (2), it is not possible to know the resulting color of mixing these three colors. In addition, Expression (2) may be too complicated for value manipu- lations.\n\n[0085] In some example color systems, the color codes and color conversions may be specified as follows.\n\n[0086] In a RGB system, each of R(red), G(green), B(blue) colors has 256 values expressed as [0,1, 2, . . . , 255], and is coded as (r, g, b).\n\n[0093] In addition, these color system does not support easy color blending using available colors. For example, given a target color in RGB (or HSV) showing on a color rendering apparatus, current color systems do not support blend existing CMYK colors closing to the target color.\n\n[0087] In a CMYK system, each of C(Cyan), M(Mag- eton), Y(Yellow), K(Gray) has 100 levels expressed [0%,1%,2%, . . . , 99%] and is coded as (c, m, y, k).\n\n[0088] In a HSV system, H(hue) has 360 degrees expressed as [0\u00b0,1\u00b0, . . . , 360\u00b0], both S(saturation) and V(value) have 100 levels expressed as[0%,1%, ... 100%].\n\n[0094] Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inven- tors devise that these deficiencies may be owing to the lack a universal frame to bridge different color systems such RGB, CMYK, and HSV.\n\n[0089] In one example embodiment, a color conversion between RGB and CMYK may be represented as:\n\n[0095] Thus, it may be preferable to provide a universal frame having a common color space. Each color in RGB, CMYK, and HSV may be mapped into a unique color in this common space via a unique function. More preferably, under such a universal frame, the colors of various systems can be encoded, exchanged, mixed uniquely and precisely.\n\n1=255(1-c/100)(1-#/100),\n\ng=255(1-m/100)(1-K/100),\n\nb=255(1-y/100}(1-#/100}.\n\nExpression (1):\n\n[0090] In an alternative example embodiment, a color conversion between RGB and HSV may be represented as:\n\n[0096] In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a color coding system compris- ing a color mapper arranged to map a plurality of colors with a plurality of numerical codes, wherein the each of the plurality of numerical codes is a unique integer determined based on a combination of prime numbers.\n\n\u4eba gt, B-(77255,g/255,0/255), and where\n\nExpression (2):\n\nFor the value of h,\n\n[0097] In this example, the colors are represented in form of unique integers, such that the colors may be easily manipulated based on computational functions.

For example, in RGB color representation, the basic colors are red, green and blue whereas in CYMK, the basic colors are cyan, yellow and magenta.\n\n[0114] Preferably, each of the plurality of numerical codes is arranged to represent a unique color in a color space. Effectively, for a color i, all these functions have the same integer value, described as I(a,, B,, o,)=q(r,, g,. b,)=f(c,, m,, y;, k,=t(h, s, V,); this is the universality feature of the color coding system.\n\n[0100] Based on prime-number-theory, U-Color creates an integer space where each color has a unique integer number. Preferably, U-Color may uses primes 2, 3, and 5 to represent cyan, magenta and yellow respectively. In addition, their products, i.e. 6, 15, 10, and 30 may represent blue, red, green, and gray. Alternatively, other prime numbers may be used instead. In this disclosure, the prime numbers are denoted as p, representing i basic colors or color compo- nents.\n\n[0115] In addition, two different color i and j have different corresponding values, je.

For example, p,=2, p.\u20143, and p,\u20145 may be chosen to represent Cyan, Mageton, and Yellow respectively. Since 2, 3, and 5 are three smallest prime values, where each of them is independent with other two primes. Then 2x3=6 may represent Blue, 3x5=15 may represent Red, and 2x5=10 may represent Green. Alterna- tively, other combinations of prime numbers may also be used, and the prime numbers may represent other basic colors in other color representations.\n\n[0102] For example, a color may be represented as an integer 2% 3\u00b0 5\u00b0 for a, B, o be integers within 0 and 255. Based on this representation, more than 16 million colors may be mapped by the color mapper. The mixture of multiple colors can also be manipulated conveniently. Alter- natively, different number of i andj may be used in different embodiments such that the color mapper may map a differ- ent number of colors in a color space. For example, when j is in the range of 0-63, the color mapper may map around 26 thousands colors based on 3 basic colors pi-\n\n[0118] These three integers 6, 10, 15 are the multiplication of two primes in (2, 5 5), which implies these three colors are equally composed of two colors in (Cyan, Mageton, Yellow). Then using 2x3x5=30 to represent Gray, which implies Gray is equally composed of three colors Cyan, Mageton, and Yellow.\n\n[0103] Preferably, the integer or the numerical code may be further manipulated mathematically using different color functions. The color functions for RGB, CMYK, and HSV may be expressed respectively as q (r, g, b), f (c, m, y, k) and t (h, s, v), and the colors may be converted based on the relationship of 2\u201c3\u00b05\u00b0=f (c, m, y, k)=t (h, s, v)=q (1, g, b).\n\n[0119] Preferably, the unique color i may be represented by the integer is denoted by I (i), and follows a relationship of I @)=p,\u201cp.\"\"p3%, for the case when there are three basic colors each being represented by a different prime number p,, and the intensities of each of the color components are represented by ou, B,, o, \u20ac {0.1,2,..., 255}. In this example, I@eE I, 1 is the Integer set in U-Color Space, specified as:\n\n[0104] With reference to FIG. 1, the color coding system 100 may be used to convert colors in any one of the RGB space, CMYK space, and HSV space.

The required cost is 15.7.\n\n[0173] The linear programming problem may be setup follows:\n\n[0187] These embodiments may be advantageous in that the color coding system uses codes which are simpler than some other coding system such as the hexadecimal repre- sentation and eight-digital representation. Based on the prime-number theory, the numerical codes are compact digits which may include richer information of colors.\n\nMIN obj=!255-17,-E 3 w,c,|41255-g,-E Fwyn,|+1255\u2014 6,- Pwy;|, where w,, wz W320\n\n(the symbol \u201cIQ|\u201d means the absolute term of Q)\n\n[0174] In Example 1, the color fitting module determines the mixing weights based on a minimum difference between each of the basic colors of the first color and equivalent color components in the first color representation of the second color obtained by a combination of the two or more available colors, i.e. to find the weights on the mixture of three CMYK colors thus to minimize the difference between the target RGB colors and the mixed CMYK colors.\n\n[0188] Advantageously, the numerical codes provide manipulability of the mapped colors. It is convenient to find related colors and to mix/segregate colors using simple conversion functions.
