Moreover, the spatiotem- poral modulation introduces equivalent magnetic polariz- ability Pim(fotmfy,) at the m\u201d-order harmonic frequency, providing additional degrees of freedom to control the other properties of EM waves. Once the excited magnetic polar- izability of each meta-atom is known, the radiation pattern of the universal metasurface antenna 400 in free space can be obtained.\n\n[0174] In one example, generally identical rectangular time sequences are applied (FIG. 25 with At=0) to meta-atoms. The corresponding magnetic polarizability can expressed as\n\nbe\n\n\u201c7/2 s 1/Ty s7/2 \u00a9 ever others P= a\n\nwhere P, is the constant magnetic polarizability as the meta-atom is in the radiating state.\n\nis the duty cycle for the Iu) and Iv) components, which is defined as the ratio of the time a meta-atom is in the coupling state (\u201c1\u201d) over a modulation time cycle.
