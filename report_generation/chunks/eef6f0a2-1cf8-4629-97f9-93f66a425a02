Therefore, it is believed that the present invention may overcome certain barriers for conventional APDT agents. It is believed that the complexes herein may damage multiple, many or even all biological components of the cell membrane, we can spe- cifically activate complexes in the tumor region by irradia- tion this region with NIR light. Also, these complexes can be further conjugated with tumor-targeting groups, such as antibody or tumor-targeting peptides, to enhance the tumor- targeting ability.) Thus it is understood that the present platinum(IV) complexes may be generally classified as a\n\nalso\n\ndrug; or [0082]\n\na prodrug.
