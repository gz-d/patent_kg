One portion 14 of the superelastic support member 10 can be subjected to a deformation force and bent to conform to the deformed spine portion 4. The anchor member 30 can be applied to join the bent portion 14 of the support member 10 and the deformed spine portion 4, such as shown in Fig. 1b. The correction of spine deformities can be achieved by straightening the bent portion 14 in a coronal or sagittal plane. In one exemplary embodiment, the support mem- ber 10 is capable of returning to its initial shape and pro- viding a constant or substantially constant correction force in the return process. Additionally or alternatively, a transverse traction member 32 can be provided, which is capable of providing a constant or substantially con- stant transverse traction force for correcting spine de- formities as will be discussed below. [0043] Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the cor- rection device 1, which is of a single support member type. Similar to the above, the support member 10 can be in a \"C\" or \"S\" shape, depending on the sagittal profile of the spine. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be longitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be disposed on the deformed spine 2 extending between a proximal vertebra 6 and a distal vertebra 8. The support member 10 can be mount- ed onto the spine 2 to provide a support for the correction device 1. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 2, the two ends 16 and 18 of the support member 10 can be fixed to the proximal vertebra 6 and the distal vertebra 8. In another exemplary embodiment, the sup- port member 10 can be secured to multiple sections of the deformed spine 2. [0044] One or more anchor members 30 can be used to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4. Similar to the above, the anchor", "type": "Document"}}
