[0032] The equivalent circuit of this invention when used with the planar inductive charger is shown in Fig. 19. Unlike that reported by Choi (Fig.5), the multilayer winding array that generates a uniform magnetic field over the charging surface (primary system) can be rep- resented as groups of windings that can be connected to the high-frequency AC inverter in series, in parallel or a combination of both. When the secondary loads are placed on the charging surface, near field coupling and therefore energy transfer occur between the charging platform and the secondary loads. [0033] In summary, at least in its preferred forms this invention has the following advantageous features. The use of the proposed inductive charging device is simple and consists of only a thin sheet of soft magnetic material, a winding, a small AC capacitor, a diode rectifier and a DC capacitor (and an optional voltage regulator). The invention is particularly useful for use with any charging platform (such as that shown in WO03/105308 but not limited thereto) which provides magnetic flux \"perpendic- ular\" to the charging surface, the entire area of the pro- posed device can be used to pick up the AC flux. For the same reason, the structure of the proposed device can be of low-profile (i.e. very thin, less than 1mm), making it easy to mount the proposed planar device on the active side of the battery inside a battery pack without increasing the overall thickness of the battery pack substantially. This low-profile device can be used as a separate circuit to make existing batteries compatible with the planar in- ductive battery charger or can be integrated into new battery packs. The secondary resonant tank allows a rel- atively low switching frequency to be chosen so as to optimize the charging performance such is improved en- ergy efficiency and energy", "type": "Document"}}
