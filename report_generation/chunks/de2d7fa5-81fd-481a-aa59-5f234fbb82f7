More- over, the crack should develop along the direction of vertical peeling force; (2) the PDMS mold should be able to elasti- cally deform and can be released completely from the closed-loop master. To provide a fundamental guidance for successful 3D replication, the reproducible formation and configuration of the cracks in both Phase I and IT of CECE are studied. In Phase I, the geometry of the master deter- mines the stress distribution in the PDMS, and thereby the eventual location and direction of cracking. To study how the geometric features of masters affect the crack formation, a simple analytical model is provided. As shown in FIG. 2A, a cracking coefficient n=W,,,,,/h is defined to predict the location of the cracking, where W,,,,, is the smallest width of the neck region and h is the height of the locked part. Similarly, to quantify the required maximum deformation of PDMS elastomer for its complete release from the master, it is denoted a deformation coeflicient Q=W,,5/Winaxs Where Wax is the largest width near the locked region. To provide guidance for the rational design of proper master structures, a phase diagram showing the effect of geometric parameters on the crack formation behavior is mapped out (FIG. 2B). The CECE will fail under the following two conditions. (1) when 1<100%, the neck region breaks before the desired. cracking emerges along the direction of peeling force; (2) when 1/p<e (where g is the ultimate elongation of elastomer at break, e=250% for PDMS), the deformation of PDMS goes beyond its limit and as a result the mold cannot be released during the separation process. To validate the present model, a series of PDMS molds were fabricated based on closed-loop masters with various geometries n and. \u00a2. Notably, the cracking behaviors observed in the present invention are consistent with the prediction shown in the phase", "type": "Document"}}
