Therefore, tests included in the third tier are cellular toxicity test, organ- specific toxicity test and cardiotoxicity test. In the cytotoxic- ity test, number of dead cells (apoptotic cells) is quantified by low cytometry. By flow cytometry, one can analyze, in addi- tion to amount of dead cells, the amount of cells in different stages of cell cycle in a large number of samples, like 300 teleosts in a single experiment. In organ-specific toxicity, morphology of an organ is studied by fluorescent in situ hybridization with an organ specific probe. The morphology of the organ is quantified by 3D reconstruction of the optical sections from confocal images. Any change in the size and shape of the organ may reveal the toxic effects induced by the agent tested. Cardiotoxicity tests whether the positive candi- date is able to affect cardiac functions, such as cardiac output and cardiac rhythm. Cardiotoxicity is an important test because more and more drugs have been shown to exhibit side effects on the heart, even in rare occurrence, and needed to be withdrawn from market. Finally, the effect of angiogenic modulating activity of the positive candidate is evaluated at the NOAEC. The positive candidate that does not induce any cytotoxic, organ-specific toxic and cardiotoxic effects and exhibits angiogenic modulating activity at the NOAEC is said\n\nDETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention provides methods for screening agents for angiogenic modulating activity.", "type": "Document"}}
