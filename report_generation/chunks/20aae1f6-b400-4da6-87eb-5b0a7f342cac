Further tasks or cognitive behaviors that can be analyzed using the methods of the invention are reading, picture viewing, video viewing, scene viewing, driving, navigation, and others.\n\nAdvantageously, the methods of the instant invention enable the assessment of more than one cognitive state in complex tasks and allow the identification of said cognitive states based on the measured eye movement patterns.\n\nIn preferred embodiments, specific eye movement patterns of a specific cognitive state are used to identify in a subject a certain cognitive state.\n\nIn further embodiments, systems are provided to perform the methods of the instant invention. In some embodiments, the systems comprise a camera and a processor configured to detect an eye position within a facial image captured by the camera. In some embodiments, the processor is further configured to perform the steps and/or algorithms of the instant invention. In preferred embodiments, the processor is configured to read and process data from the camera according to a Matlab toolbox to analyze HMMs, EMHMMs, and EMSHMMs.\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\nI]\n\nIn some embodiments, an electronic device is provided that comprises a camera and a processor configured to detect a center position of an eye within a facial image captured via the camera in response to detecting an eye within the facial image; determine an eye gaze position based on the center position and a pupil position; analyse the eye gaze position in consecutively captured facial images; and measure an eye movement patterns based on the eye gaze positions of the consecutively captured facial images.", "type": "Document"}}
