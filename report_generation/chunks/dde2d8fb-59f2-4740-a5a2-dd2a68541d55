The one or more solar cells can process (e.g., absorb, transform) the optical signals to generate elec- trical power that can be provided to the barrier control com- ponent 206, barrier component 204, and/or projector screen component 202 to power some or all of these components. In some implementations, the sensor array can include the one or more solar cells, wherein the one or more solar cells can be used as sensors to detect an optical signal to facilitate identi- fying a corresponding control signal, and also can be used to generate power by receiving and processing the optical sig- nals. In other implementations, the sensor array can use other types of sensors (e.g., light sensors), in addition to or as an alternative to solar cells, to detect an optical signal to facilitate identifying a corresponding control signal.", "type": "Document"}}
