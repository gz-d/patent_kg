The suspension of step (c) can be cooled by any means/tools well known in the art. In some embodiments, the suspension is let stand still until the temperature drops to room temperature. Optionally or alter- natively, the suspension is cooled by placing it in an ice bath until the temperature reaches 0\u00b0 C. In one working example, the suspension is placed in the ice-water bath of 0\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes to precipitate the desired solder particles. In addi- tion, or optionally, the present method further includes washing the thus-produced solder particles with deionized. water and ethanol, and/or drying the thus-produced solder particles in a vacuum-dried oven.\n\n[0055] According to embodiments of the present disclo- sure, the thus produced Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder particles are characterized in having a particle size that is less than 10 hm in diameter, such as, less than 6 jum, less than 3 jum, less than 1 wm, or less than 0.1 um. In some embodiments, each Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 Im base solder particles is about 0.1 to 3 hm in diameter. In other embodiments, each Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles is about 1 to 6 hm in diameter.\n\n[0056] 2.2 Composition\n\n[0057] Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a solder alloy composition comprising a plurality of solder particles of a Sn\u2014Bi\u2014lIn base alloy described herein. Specifically, the plurality of solder particles of Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base alloy are prepared by the present method set forth above, and each solder particles is less than 10 hm in diameter. Preferably, each solder particles contained in the\n\nUS 2024/0009777 Al\n\npresent solder alloy composition is about 0.1 to 6 um in diameter; more preferably, each solder particles is about 0.1 to 3 hm in diameter.", "type": "Document"}}
