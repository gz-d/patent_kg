To facilitate high resolution of measurement, a carrier frequency modulator in terms of an electronically controlled liquid crystal variable retarder is implemented into the common interferometric path. The exit beam, which is now selectively modulated by SPW together with a carrier frequency modulation, in fact contains SPR information enclosed by the spectral bandwidth of the polychromatic source. Consequently, ifan optical spec- trum analyzer (OSA) is configured to collect the light energy of the entire reflected spectrum, the signal from individual detector elements is equivalent to conducting SPR detection with numerous carrier frequency modulated monochromatic sources. By implementation of spectral interferometry, the signal traces collected by the OSA contain the necessary information for finding both the spectral SPR reflectivity dip as well as the spectral SPR phase of the polychromatic spec- trum simultaneously. This means it is possible to cover all the performance attributes of conventional spectral SPR systems, while at the same time further provides much improved reso- lution capability through carrier frequency modulated spec-", "type": "Document"}}
