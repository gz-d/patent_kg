However, for prolonged use in a human body, deterioration of the corrosion resistance of the materials becomes a critical issue, because of the possibility of deleterious ions released from the substrate to living tissues. Therefore, we suggested the use of plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition and related ion- beam and plasma-based techniques to implant some other elements, such as C2H2, N2, and O2, into NiTi substrates to alter corrosion resistance and wear properties of the alloys. We have successfully demonstrated that the corrosion resistance and wear properties of nickel titanium shape memory alloys can be enhanced by implanting nitrogen, carbon and oxygen onto the substrate surface. Additionally, with the use of plasma immersion ion implantation or deposition,\n\n3\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n55\n\nEP 1 835 946 B1", "type": "Document"}}
