This study revealed that the probe, KPlip, labelled Sirt2 more strongly than other sirtuins did, confirming that Sirt2 rec- ognizes lipoylated lysine more preferentially than other sirtuins do. To examine whether lipoic acid of KPlip forms a disulfide bond with cysteine residues in Sirt2, excessive reducing reagent TCEP was added to the solution containing Sirt2 and KPlip prior to UV irradiation. No diminished effect of Sirt2 labelling was observed, suggesting the labelling of Sirt2 by probe KPlip was not redox-based. Moreover, the labelling of Sirt2 can be inhibited by a lipoylated peptide competitor (VQSDK,,,ASVT, FIG. 1c), verifying that the interaction between Sirt2 and lipoylated peptide is selective and direct.\n\n[0081] The capacity of HDACs to recognize and remove the lipoyl group of KTlip was examined by a fluorimeter assay. KTlip was incubated with various HDACs at 37\u00b0 C. in HEPES buffer (pH 8.0). The fluorescence of the enzy- matic reactions was then measured accordingly.\n\n[0082] As shown in FIG. 6, Sirt2 showed the strongest fluorescence increment, with 60-fold fluorescence increase. Sirtl showed a much lower fluorescence signal, whereas Sirt3, Sirt5, Sirt6, and HDAC8 did not show a noticeable fluorescence increase. The control group without cofactor NAD+ displayed negligible fluorescence, indicating that the reaction occurred through enzymatic catalysis. Further HPLC and MS analysis confirmed that the molecular weight of the newly generated peak corresponded to the expected tandem de-lipoylated/exchanged product. No de-lipoylated product was observed under the enzymatic reaction condi- tions for HDACS8. After enzymatic reaction with Sirt2, a shift of peak absorption from 380 nm to 480 nm was clearly\n\nExample 4: Pull-Down Validation of KPlip", "type": "Document"}}
