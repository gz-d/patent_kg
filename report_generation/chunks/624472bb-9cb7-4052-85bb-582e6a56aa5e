Peptides were then ionized by electro- spray at 1.5 kV. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode at a resolution of 120 000, with a full MS spectrum (m/z=350-1800) using an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3x10\u00b0. Higher-energy collisional dissocia- tion (HCD) fragmentation was conducted with the 12 most intense ions (normalized collision energy 27). MS/MS spec- tra were acquired with an AGC target of 1x10\u00b0 at a resolu- tion of 30 000. The dynamic exclusion time was set to 30s.\n\nnight. After incubation, the membrane was washed with TBST (3x 5 min) gently at room temperature. Following that, the membrane was incubated with the secondary anti- body (IRDye 680RD donkey anti-rabbit IgG) at room tem- perature for another I h. It was then washed with TBST (3x5 min). Finally, the membrane was applied to fluorescence scanning.\n\n[0101] Absorption and Fluorescence Study of Probe KTlip.\n\nThe probe KTlip was incubated with sirtuin and NAD+ at 37\u00b0 C. in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl,, and 2.7 mM KCl. The enzymatic reaction volume was 50 HL. When the enzymatic reaction was complete, the reaction was applied for absorption and fluorescence measurement. The parameter set for absor- bance measurement was as follows: UV-visible light, col- lection region: 300-550 nm. The parameter set for fluores- cence measurements was as follows: \u548c =480nm slit width: 5 nm, collection region: 510-600 nm.\n\n[0098] Proteomics Analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
