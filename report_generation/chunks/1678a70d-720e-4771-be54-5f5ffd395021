The processing unit 520 may comprise a per- sonal microcomputer or any other processor. It is employed to compute the differential phase between p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam directly. Subsequently, the refractive index change associated with the binding of biomolecules to the sensor surface can be found.\n\nThe intensity recorded by each pixel on the detector array a channeled interference spectrum as shown in FIG. 7a which can be described by the following equation", "type": "Document"}}
