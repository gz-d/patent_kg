Specifically, FIG. 23 shows the configura-\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\ntion of the universal metasurface antenna 400 with a meta- atom array located on the top of the waveguide. In this embodiment, each meta-atom includes two +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to radiate two orthogonal eigen-polarization\n\nlu\n\n)\n\nand IW states. PIN diodes, controlled by the external control signals from FGPA, are embedded into each slot opening to switch the meta-atom between the radiating (coding element \u201c1\u201d) and non-radiating (coding element \u201cQ\u201d) states in real time. FIG. 24 shows the formulation of the \u201c0/1\u201d STC matrix, representing the radiating/non-radiating states of all the meta-atoms at one modulation period. Each inclined slot opening has its own independent time-coding sequence. The STC matrix includes two parts: the upper and\n\nlower parts correspond to slot-opening columns for It) and\n\nlv) polarization radiations, respectively. FIG. 25 shows the time sequence for each meta-atom with a time shift t,. FIG. 26 shows the operation principle of the universal metasur- face antenna 400 for wavefront manipulation at harmonic frequencies. The total phase shift of the extracted wave includes two parts: the phase accumulation due to the propagation of the guided wave @oy=-EGyx,, and the abrupt phase shift induced by the spatiotemporal modulation @s7--2amf, A(x). The time shifts applied to the meta-atoms can control the momentum and phase at the target harmonic frequency.", "type": "Document"}}
