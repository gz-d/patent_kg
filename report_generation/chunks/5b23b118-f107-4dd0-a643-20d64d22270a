Eye movements during scene perception reflect the complexity of cognitive processes involved, and thus can potentially provide nch information about individual differences in perception styles and cognitive abilities. For example, it was observed that Westerners made more eye fixations on foreground objects whereas Asians looked at the backgrounds more often, and this difference was reflected in their foreground object recognition performance. This phenomenon has been linked to cultural differences in perception styles: Westerners are more likely to attribute the cause of an event to isolated objects (analytic style), whereas Asians are more likely to attribute the cause of an event to the context of the event (holistic style). However, these effects have not been found consistently and some studies found no difference between American and Chinese participants either in foreground object recognition performance or in number of fixations and durations to the foreground and background. Thus, it remains unclear whether eye movement patterns consistently reflect cultural differences in perception styles and individual differences in cognitive abilities.\n\nPrevious studies have attempted to use machine-learning methods to infer characteristics of the observer from eye movement data. These studies typically used classifiers to discover eye movement features important for distinguishing two or more observers. However, the classifiers only look for features important for separating the observers, and do not provide any information about eye movement patterns associated with a particular observer. The EMHMM approach, where HMM is a type of time-series statistical model, has been developed by the inventors. This approach takes individual differences in\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651", "type": "Document"}}
