Freestanding gold (Au) nanosheets with a nanoscale thick- ness, also termed as 2D Au in the literature of 2D metals, have attracted considerable research interest for their appli- cations In catalysis, photoelectronics, and biomedicine. As a result of the high surface-to-volume ratio, Au nanosheets contain much more low-coordinated surface atoms than their bulk counterparts. Consequently, the active sites offered by Au nanosheets are abundant in various electrochemical reactions, which can lead to exceptionally high catalytic activities in CO oxidation or selective oxidation of C\u2014H bonds. Meanwhile, the high surface-to-volume ratio also endows Au nanosheets with unique shape-dependent optical properties due to the collective oscillations of conduction electrons on their surface, a phenomenon known as \u201csurface plasmon resonance\u201d, which can result in high absorptions that can be extended to the near-infrared (NIR) region and hence suitable for applications in biomedical diagnostics and biosensors.", "type": "Document"}}
