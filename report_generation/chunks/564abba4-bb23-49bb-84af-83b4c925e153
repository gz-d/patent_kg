The silicon mold master is manufactured by firstly pattern- ing positive photoresist (AZ5214, AZ Electronic Materials, Branchburg, NI) to a silicon wafer, followed by deep reac- tive ion etching (DRIE) and stripping the photoresist. Next, the first-stage standard replica molding process is applied using the silicon mold master to obtain a PDMS substrate with the reversed microstructures, acting as a negative mold. A molecular layer of trichloro (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluoro- octyl) silane (Sigma-Aldrich) is applied on microstructures of the PDMS mold. The silanized PDMS mold is immersed in deionized water and oven for 1 hour, in order to further remove any excessive silane coating. Another round of the standard replica molding of PDMS is then applied on the silanized PDMS mold. Holes at punched at the inlets and outlets of the PDMS substrate. The micropatterned side of the newly molded PDMS substrate is bonded on a glass slide using oxygen plasma treatment (Plasma Prep II, SPI Sup- plies) such that the microfluidic device is formed. Afterward, cell-repelling pluronics F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich) molecules is applied along the microfluidic channels to eliminate cell\n\nattachment on the channel walls.\n\nCell Culture", "type": "Document"}}
