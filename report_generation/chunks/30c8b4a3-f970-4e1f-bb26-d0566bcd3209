It should be bore in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quan- tities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quan- tities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the foregoing discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the disclosed subject matter, discussions utilizing terms such as processing, computing, calculating, determining, and/or dis- playing, and the like, refer to the action and processes of computer systems, and/or similar consumer and/or industrial electronic devices and/or machines, that manipulate and/or transform data represented as physical (electrical and/or elec- tronic) quantities within the computer\u2019s and/or machine\u2019s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the machine and/or computer system memories or registers or other such information stor- age, transmission and/or display devices.\n\nAt 3506, a desired rectified power signal (e.g., rectified DC power signal) can be generated based at least in part on controlling of the switching of the power switches. As desired, the rectified power signal can be connected to a desired load (e.g., resistive, capacitive, and/or inductive load).\n\ndepicts an example methodology creating asynchronous rectifier (e.g., SDSR) in accordance with vari- ous aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. At 3602, a plurality of power switches, comprising at least four power switches, can be arranged in the form of, or at least to function a bridge rectifier.", "type": "Document"}}
