Other chemicals and solvents were obtained from\n\ncontent of carvacrol in the composition increased . This was\n\nSigma - Aldrich and used as received .\n\nUS 2021/0179749 Al\n\nJun. 17, 2021\n\n[0128] In yet a further aspect, the present invention also refers to a method of killing or controlling the growth of microorganisms comprising contacting the microorganisms with a composition, particularly the composition as dis- cussed previously.\n\n[0135] Synthesis of the Monomeric Unit of Formula\n\n[0136] In a particular embodiment, the monomeric unit has a structure of Formula (III), ie. (UPy-NCO),Priamine. (UPy-NCO),Priamine was obtained by reacting 2 equiva- lents of UPy-NCO and 1 equivalent of priamine 1074. A 500-mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux cooler was charged with priamine 1074 (1.593 g, 3 mmol) and DMSO (150 mL), then UPy-NCO (1.758 g, 6 mmol) was added drop wise. After reacting at 90\u00b0 C. under the protec- tion of nitrogen for 6 hours, the solvent DMSO was removed, and the solid product was washed 3 times with 60 mL portions of acetone. (UPy-NCO),Priamine was then collected by centrifugation and dried overnight under high vacuum at 60\u00b0 C.\n\n[0129] It would be appreciated that the present invention also pertains to a kit comprising the composition described above as well as use of the composition medical purposes such as topical administration.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1A\n\n[0137] Preparation of Composition of the Present Inven- tion\n\nMolecular Design of the Composition", "type": "Document"}}
