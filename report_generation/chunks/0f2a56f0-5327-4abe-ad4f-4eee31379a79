The filter-antenna 200 generally includes a microstrip antenna integrated with an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. In this embodiment, the microstrip antenna is a patch antenna and. the absorptive filter is a band-stop filter for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy.\n\n[0027] In one embodiment of the third aspect, the filter element comprises a resistor. The resistor may be a chip resistor.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0028] Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accom- panying drawings in which:\n\n[0045] As shown in FIGS. 2A to 2D, the filter-antenna 200 includes a substrate 202, a patch network 204 formed by conductive patches on an upper face of the substrate 202, and a ground plane 206 formed by a conductive surface on a lower face of the substrate 202. The substrate 202 has a dielectric constant \u00a2,.,. The substrate 202 has a thickness (in z-direction) t, and an area (in x-y plane) of GxG. A coaxial connector or feed connector 208, with an inner cable of radius r,, is attached to the lower surface of the substrate 202 and penetrates through the substrate 202 to connect with a patch 204A of the patch network 204. The cable feed 208 is soldered to the patch 204A for exciting the filter-antenna 200.\n\n[0029] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a filter- antenna in one embodiment of the invention;\n\nFIG. 2A is a top view of a filter-antenna in embodiment of the invention;\n\n[0031] FIG. 2B is an enlarged view of a patch in the filter-antenna of FIG. 2A;\n\n[0032] FIG. 2C is a side view of the filter-antenna of FIG. 2A;\n\n[0033] FIG. 2D is a bottom view of the filter-antenna 2A;", "type": "Document"}}
