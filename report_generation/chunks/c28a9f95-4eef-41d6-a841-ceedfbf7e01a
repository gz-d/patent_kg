A part 300P of the array 300 is shown enlarged in FIG. 3B. The 12x12 coupled oscillator array 300 includes 144 oscillators operably coupled with each other via even-mode-shorted couplers 320 and odd-mode-shorted. couplers 310 (for simplicity, only one for each is labeled in FIG. 3B) as described with reference of FIG. 2.\n\n[0143] In this embodiment, the oscillators (-gm cells) of the array 300 are arranged to collectively oscillate at the fundamental oscillation frequency (fo) of 225 GHz and to radiate the third harmonic (3fo) using the corresponding differentially-fed patch antennas of a patch antenna arrange-\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nment (the patches of the patch antennas are not specifically illustrated). In this embodiment, the operation mode of the third harmonic 3f, is the same as the fundamental frequency fo: and horizontally adjacent oscillators can provide out-of- phase excitation at 3f, to the corresponding patch antenna. Accordingly, the patch antenna can serve as a power com- biner to improve area efficiency.\n\n300 is divided into\n\nIn this embodiment, the\n\n[0144]", "type": "Document"}}
