The main patch 204A includes a central portion 204A1 and two side portions 204A2, 204A3 arranged on two sides of the central portion 204A1. The central portion 204A1 includes two generally U-shaped slots 220 disposed symmetrically about an axis of symmetry (in x-direction) of the main patch 204A. Each of the U-shaped slots 220 is associated with a respective open stub (surrounded by a dotted loop near 220), a Ag/4 open stub (A, is the guided wavelength). Each of the side portions 204A2, 204A3 include a dual-stub or a dual-stub feed 222. Each dual stub feed 222 include stubs of lengths of Le and L, (Le > L-) separated by width W,. The two stubs have the same width of We. The central portion 204A1 is connected with the feed 208 at one end and with a resistor element 1n the other end.\n\n214\n\nThe two side patches 204B, 204C are parasitic slotted patches. Each of the patches 204B, 204C is generally rectangular and includes a rectangular slot. The two side patches 204B, 204C are symmetrically disposed about the axis of symmetry (in x-direction) of the main patch 204A. The two side patches 204B, 204C are also aligned with the main patch 204A in that their top edges (in the x-direction) are on the same level and their bottom edges (in the x-direction) are on the same level. Each of the slotted patches 204B, 204C has a length of La and width of W4, and ls respectively spaced apart from the edge of the main patch 204A by a distance Si. The rectangular slot has a length of Lp and width of ol\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825", "type": "Document"}}
