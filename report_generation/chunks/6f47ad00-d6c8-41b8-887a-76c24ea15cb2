In this embodiment, no microplate or frame is used to define the separate areas of ice to be infused with drug solution. A mould 1705, like an ice tray, is provided to make the embodiment. The mould 1705 is filled with deionised water, and flash frozen to form a singular, large piece of ice 1701. The base of the mould 1705 has protrusions 1707 that create depressions 1703 or wells into the piece of ice. When the ice 1701 is removed from the mould 1705 and turned over, the top surface of the ice 1701 now has multiple depressions 1703, each suitable for being filled with one drop of a drug solution at an appropriate concentration. In particular, if the drug to be made into a nanodrug is curcumin as afore- described, each of the depressions preferably has a bottom surface area that is similar to the area of defined by the\n\nUS 2021/0393541 Al\n\nmouth of each well 103 in the 24-well microplate 101. That is, the base of each depression 1703 has an area of 200 mm\u2019, such that a volume of 50 hl to 150 pl of the curcumin solution can be applied into each depression 1703, where the concentration of the curcumin solution is 1 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml. This embodiment has the added advantage that a foreign material in the form of a frame or a plastic tray does not have to come into contact with the solution. This avoids any chemical affinity, contamination or loss of yield from contact between hydrophobic solution and organic plastic.", "type": "Document"}}
