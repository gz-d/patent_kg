The electromagnetic actuation sys- tems are taken as that with reference to FIG. 7. The optimized geometric parameters of core structure for each magnetic core are as follows. The radius of the magnetic core is 38 mm. The length of the magnetic core is 537 mm.\n\n[0098] For ease of description, the electromagnetic devices are labelled using digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. A electromagnetic device is referred by using the word \u201ccoil\u201d followed by the respective digit. This is also applicable to description below with reference to FIG. 12A or FIG. 13A. In the present description, statements such as an electric coi or magnetic coil or coil being energized with or under a current, an electromagnetic device being energized with or under a current, and a magnetic core being energized with or under a current, or the like, have same meanings.\n\n[0099] As illustrated, four coils are energized. Coil 1 and 5 are energized with 20 A in clockwise direction while coi 2 and 6 energized with 20 A in counterclockwise direction. The representative magnetic field line 1101 (as indicated by dashed arrow) of coil 1 and the magnetic field line 1105 of coil 5 are pointing into the workspace center, while the magnetic field line 1102 of coil 2 and the magnetic field line 1106 of coil 6 are leaving the workspace center.\n\nare\n\n[0100] As illustrated by curves 1110a@ and 11106, for the maximum performance, the magnetic flux density and gra- dient for the workspace are around 125 mT at point 5 and 1.63 T/m at point 4 respectively when the workspace is o 160 mm in size. The magnetic flux density and gradient are around 227 mT at point 5 and 4.4 T/m at point 4 when the workspace is of 100 mm in size. The data are shown in Table 2.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nMagnetic flux density and magnetic field gradient for workspace of 160", "type": "Document"}}
