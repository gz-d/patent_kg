The\n\nparticipants in group A showed a stronger gaze cascade effect. The probability that group A looked at the chosen item reached 94.5% at the end. A /-test was conducted to examine when their probability of viewing the chosen stimulus was above chance level. The result showed that this occurred at around 1000 ms before the end of a trial, t(10) = 2.44, p = 0.035, d = 0.74, at which time point they spent about 66% of their time on the chosen item. In contrast, participants in group B had a weaker cascade effect, looking at the chosen item about 81% of the time at the end. A \u00a2-test indicated that the proportion of time spent on the chosen item was significantly above the chance level at 900 ms before the end of a trial, t(12) = 2.29, p = 0.041, d = 0.64, at which point the probability to view the chosen side increased from 59% to 81%. Group B also exhibited a short period of slightly higher than chance viewing (54%) of the chosen side between 2100ms and 1600ms before the end of the trial (FIGURE 7). The proportions at each time point were also compared between the two groups using independent sample f-tests. It was found that during 700 ms before the end of a trial to the end of the trial, group A spent significantly more time looking at the to-be-chosen item than group B (FIGURE 7). Thus, although both groups exhibited the gaze cascade effect, they differed in both magnitude and onset time, suggesting substantial individual differences in the gaze cascade effect. These results indicated that the EMSHMM method of the instant invention allowed the detection of these individual differences in the gaze cascade effect through\n\nclustering participants\u2019 eye movement patterns according to their similarities.", "type": "Document"}}
