The thickness of the IMC layer was identified using the cross section (SEM image). Also, the area (A) of the IMC layer in the SEM image was measured and divided by its width (L) to calculate the IMC thickness. 6, A and L were carefully measured using Image J software. The contact Angle and IMC layer thickness data presented in this study are aver- ages of five different regions of the three solder joints.\n\n[0073] Shear Test\n\n[0074] The samples were fixed on the uniaxial shear test equipment, with jig 155 um away from the bigger substrate. When the shear test began, the jig moved towards the solder joint at a rate of 2 mm/min until the solder joint was completely fractured. The strain rate of the shear test was 6.6x10~* s~', the whole process was performed at ambient temperature.\n\nExample 1 Production and Characterization of the Present Sn\u2014Bi\u2014in Base Solder Particles\n\n[0075] 1. Size of the Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 in Particles\n\n[0076] The Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles were pro- duced in accordance with procedures described in \u201cMateri- als and Methods\u201d section. Briefly, Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In-based bulk alloy was ultrasonicated at 75\u00b0 C. with ultrasonic machine set at three different conditions to give three groups of Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles: 40 kHz, 120 W for 30 minutes (Group I), 40 kHz and 120 W for 60 minutes (Group Il), and 80 kHz and 120 W for 120 minutes (Group III). The cooling temperature for each groups was about 0\u00b0 C. The present Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder particles in each group were analyzed via SEM, DSC, ERD, and EDS, respectively. Results are provided in FIGS. 1 and 2.\n\nFIGS. 1A to 1C are SEM photographs of the three\n\n[0077]", "type": "Document"}}
