A finger touch is detected by the touch sensor 700 by detecting and measuring a change in voltage and current induced by the heat from the person\u2019s finger. The heat transfer between the finger and the sensor surface creates a temperature gradient on the material interface that leads to the generation of an impulse current i.e. a current pulse. A unique current pulse is generated each time the sensor 700 is touched by a user\u2019s finger.\n\npositioned at an opposing end of the substrate 702 to where the second electrode is located.", "type": "Document"}}
