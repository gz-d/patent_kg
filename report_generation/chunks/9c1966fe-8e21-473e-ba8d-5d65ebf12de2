The computation of DCT-transformed F is, however, much more complex than the ICT-transformed F* as the scale transform contains fractional coefficients. Thus, if we can build a bridge between SSD(F, F) and F*, then we can skip the calculation of F and F. In order to achieve this purpose, we rearrange the quantization and inverse quantiza- tion processes of F in terms of pre-scaled quantization and inverse quantization of F*. The coefficients of F can be oO\n\nInorder to make use of the advantage given by Equation 22, we propose to use an iterative table-lookup method for sim- plifying the quantization process of f,,*; and computing of the SSD using i, * Thus, the computationally intensive division and multiplication operations can be avoided.\n\n3.3 Iterative Table-Lookup Quantization Process\n\nBasically, the quantization process is to find the nearest quantization point as shown in FIG. 4. In FIG. 4, axis 200 represents the value of fr* and has quantization points 210, 220, 230, 240 and 250. Quantization points 210, 220, 230, 240 and 250 have quantized values of -2, -1, 0, 1 and 2 respectively and inverse quantized values of -2 Ar -Ap0Ar and 2 A,, respectively. Each quantization point is associated with a respective quantization sub-zone and all values of f,,* in that sub-zone are given the quantized value and inverse quantized value corresponding to that quantization point.\n\nism vet (EQUATION 20) A \u51fa = \u4e8c -roun \u201c4 i ajay) \u00a9 Si wa = fia", "type": "Document"}}
