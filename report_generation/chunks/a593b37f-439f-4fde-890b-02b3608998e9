The precoder device in accordance with claim 1, wherein the process time includes a time period defined by a symbol rate at the receiver end.\n\n5. The precoder device in accordance with claim wherein the process time includes a sampling time period analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver\n\n[0063] In one example, the wireless signal transmitter may include a plurality of transmission antennas at the output stage, and the wireless signal receiver may comprise plurality of receive antennas and a plurality of digital equalizers.\n\n6. The precoder device in accordance with claim wherein the precoder device is a trailing-zero analogue precoder.\n\n[0064] These embodiments may be advantageous in that analogue preceding only requires the use of relatively simple analogue delay components, such as delay-lines. The system has the advantage of low hardware complexity and does not require, the use of large memory module to construct the analogue precoder when compared with other example preceding systems. In addition, the system may perform with higher energy efliciency while maintaining the same communication efficiency, simply by using analogue pre- coder with analogue delay components in precoder-equal- izer communication systems.\n\n7. The precoder device in accordance with claim 1, further comprising a universal precoder and a plurality of analogue permutation switches both arranged to process each of plurality of sub-channels in the signal at the transmitter end.", "type": "Document"}}
