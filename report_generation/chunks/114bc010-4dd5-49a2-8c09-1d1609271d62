For a par- ticular substrate, it only takes about one month to find the optimal parameters for preparing nanoparticles with the desired size distribution;\n\n[0029] (3) The formed core-shell nanoparticles exhibit enhanced thermal stability, which 1s suitable for appli- cations in high-temperature catalysis and biomedical therapeutics;\n\n[0030] (4) the present method can be extended to other noble metals, e.g., silver (Ag) and platinum (Pt), form- ing noble metal-carbon core-shell nanoparticles; and\n\n[0031] (5) the prepared core-shell structure is safe and low-cost and can be mass-produced.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0032] Embodiments of the invention are described more details hereinafter with reference to the drawings, which:\n\n[0033] FIG. 1 depicts a schematic diagram of synthesizing a metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure;\n\n[0034] FIG. 2A shows a photograph of a prepared PVA- gold film on a glass substrate in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;\n\na\n\nor\n\nin\n\nin\n\nMar. 2, 2023\n\n[0035] FIG. 2B shows a photograph of a large-area free- standing organic-gold nanosheet (thickness=20 nm) sus- pending in DI water;\n\n[0036] FIG. 2C depicts an AFM mapping image thickness profile of the organic-gold nanosheets transferred onto a silicon substrate (thickness=20 nm) in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;\n\nand\n\n[0037] FIG. 2D depicts an TEM image and corresponding selected-area electron diffraction of the organic-gold nanosheets (thickness=20 nm) in accordance with embodiment of the present invention;\n\none\n\n[0038] FIG. 2E depicts a FTIR spectra of the organic-gold nanosheets (thickness=20 nm) in accordance with embodiment of the present invention;\n\none", "type": "Document"}}
