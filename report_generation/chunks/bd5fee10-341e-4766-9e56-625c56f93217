For example, according to exem- plary implementations, a solar energy collection antenna as described above regarding FIGS. 7-8 can comprise a reflector structure configured or adapted to support one or more con- formal solar cell(s) adjacent to the reflector structure. For instance, regarding FIGS. 7-8 a reflector structure can com- prise reflector 702 that can support one or more conformal solar cell(s) (e.g., one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.). While, for purposes of illustration and not limita- tion, the reflector 702 is depicted and described as a parabolic reflector 702, it can be understood that the disclosed subject matter is not so limited. For instance, it is contemplated that virtually any reflector structure (e.g., whether configured as a non-planar reflector structure, or otherwise, a parabolic reflector structure, a substantially parabolic reflector struc- ture, or otherwise, etc.) can function as reflector 702 to sup- port one or more conformal solar cell(s) adjacent to the reflec- tor structure.\n\ndepict scattering parameters (S parameters) 1502 (1602) as a function of frequency 1504 (1604) for a non-limiting one-to-three-way Wilkinson power divider 1400. While S simulated parameters results agree with the measurements, the comparison is omitted for brevity. As can be observed in FIGS. 15-16, the magnitude passband of the power divider is from 1.45 GHz to 2.23 GHz (=-4.77+0.5 dB, i=2, 3, or 4), giving a bandwidth of approxi- mately 0.78 GHz. The measured phase bandwidth (ZS,,- Z8),1)<S\u00b0, i,j>1 and ixj) is given by 2 GHz (1 GHz-3 GHz), which is much wider than the magnitude bandwidth. Thus, it can be understood that the overall bandwidth of non-limiting one-to-three-way Wilkinson power divider 1400 is limited by its magnitude", "type": "Document"}}
