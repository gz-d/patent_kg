In contrast, when all participants\u2019 preference-biased period HMMs were summarized in one representative model, it was found that participants looked more often at the to-be-chosen, preferred stimulus (Table 3b). When the percentage of time that participants were looking at the to-be-chosen stimulus before the end of a trial was plotted, 1t showed a steady increase at about 1.5 seconds before the end, demonstrating a gaze cascade effect (FIGURE 7).\n\nWhen participants\u2019\n\nSHMMs\n\nwere\n\nclustered\n\ninto\n\ntwo\n\ngroups\n\naccording to\n\ntheir\n\ncognitive state transitions, one group (group A) showed a stronger and earlier gaze cascade", "type": "Document"}}
