The method of claim 22, further comprising:\n\nresponse to the control signal, controlling an amount voltage applied to the corresponding barrier pattern; and\n\ncontrolling selection of the barrier pattern mode based at least in part on the amount of voltage applied to the corresponding barrier pattern.\n\n33. A system, comprising:\n\nwith a video image that is part of video content, in a control region of a projector screen component in rela- tion to presentation of the video image on the projector screen component, wherein the optical signal presents multiple bits of data that are indicative of a barrier pat- tern mode and a corresponding barrier pattern to use to process at least a portion of the video content, wherein the means for sensing comprises a set of means for light-wave sensing comprising at least a first means for light-wave sensing a first portion of light waves of the optical signal and a second means for light-wave sensing a second portion of the light waves of the optical signal, wherein a number of means for light-wave sensing in the set of means for light-wave sensing is equal to a bit number representing a total number of the bits of the data of the multiple bits of the data, wherein the means for sensing further comprises means for converting light energy of the optical signal to electrical energy that is used to supply power to at least one of a barrier contro component ora barrier component to facilitate operation of at least one of the barrier control component or the barrier component to facilitate controlling selecting o, the barrier pattern mode and the corresponding barrier pattern, wherein the light energy is converted to the", "type": "Document"}}
