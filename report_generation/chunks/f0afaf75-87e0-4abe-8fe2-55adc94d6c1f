The distor- tion is typically measured as the sum of squared differences between coefficients of the original source block and the coefficients of the reconstructed block. Knowing the distor- tion is also useful when deciding which encoding mode to use, as will be explained below.\n\nfare.

The SAD(S,P) is expressed by:\n\nblock, as this is an important factor in the performance of the compression algorithm. There are two principal consider- ations when selecting the block encoding mode; the first is the distortion which results from the encoding (i.e. the difference between the source image and the reconstructed image after decoding) and the second is the number of bits required to encode the block. Sometimes the latter consideration is referred to as \u2018bit rate\u2019, which is the number of bits required per second required to transmit the image at a given resolu- tion. The bit rate is related to the overall number of bits required to encode the block. It is necessary not only to select between inter, intra and skip modes, but also to select the best\n\n(EQUATION 4)\n\nNoro SAD(S, P) = 0 \u4e8c Isiz \u2014 pil", "type": "Document"}}
