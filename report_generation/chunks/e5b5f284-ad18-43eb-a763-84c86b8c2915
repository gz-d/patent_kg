The advantage observed in the congruent but not incongruent or neutral trials in the flanker task suggested that these participants might have better feature integration abilities. The shorter preplanning time in the TOL task without differences In number of moves, correct trials, or execution time suggested that they had more efficient planning abilities. Thus, because participants adopting the focused strategy preferred to look at the eyes of the animals, the focused strategy may be related to a more eyes-focused strategy in face recognition, which was associated with better face recognition performance, visual attention (the trail making task), and executive function (the TOL task; Chan et al., 2018).\n\nthe\n\nUsing the methods of the invention it was also observed that images with a salient foreground object relative to the background tended to induce large individual differences in eye movement patterns, and that animal images induced larger individual differences than vehicle images (FIGURE 3). This phenomenon may be due to humans\u2019 category specific attention to animals that made them more salient than vehicles or other object types, providing better opportunities to induce the difference between the explorative and focused strategies. This finding has important implications for the possibility of using eye tracking to provide screen tools for cognitive disorders because images that induce larger individual differences will be more likely to provide adequate variance among individuals for identifying atypically patterns.\n\nshow that the novel EMHMM with\n\nit\n\nmethod of the\n\nIn", "type": "Document"}}
