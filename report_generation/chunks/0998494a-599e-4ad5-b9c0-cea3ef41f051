A skilled person would understand that certain materials used in the invention could be substituted for other materials with similar desired properties. For example, where steel is used in the ductile compressive mechanism 50, a skilled person would realize that other materials having similar properties (and also used in buildings and structures) might be equally useful in the invention.\n\nFrom FIG. 10(5), the ductility factor of the beam, Lo, at point A of the yield plateau is given by\n\nAy +Ap Ap (7) My = =1+ \u4e4b Ay Ay or Ap = (ty - DA,\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 6 and 7 into Eq. 4\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n45\n\nExperimental tests were conducted to investigate the effec- tiveness of the new ductility scheme. One reference beam 100 and two compression yielding beams were tested. Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars 18a, were used as the ten- sion reinforcement in all the three specimens. More specifi- cally, in this particular example, 3p16 GFRP bars were used.\n\n4 \u4e00 D'Ay a \u7576 ZL- \u5b50 8 5 (8)\n\nAlso from FIG. 10(4), the ductility factor He of the com- pression yielding zone at point A' of the yield plateau that corresponds to point A of the beam response curve, is given by", "type": "Document"}}
