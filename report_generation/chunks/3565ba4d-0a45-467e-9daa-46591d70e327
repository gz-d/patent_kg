For example, according to non-limiting implementations, a solar energy collection antenna as described above regarding FIGS. 3-6 can com- prise, a reflective ground plane (e.g., ground plane 108, a non-planar reflective ground plane such as V-shaped concave ground plane 304, U-shaped concave ground plane 504, and the like, etc.) that can be adapted to reflect incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.) (e.g., a first portion of incident solar radiation) thereby resulting in reflected solar radiation. As a further example, solar energy collection antenna can include one or more antenna element (s) (e.g., SPA 102, associated L-probe 104, associated con- nector 106, subcomponents and/or combinations thereof, etc.) coupled to the reflective ground plane (e.g., ground plane 108, a non-planar reflective ground plane such as V-shaped concave ground plane 304, U-shaped concave ground plane\n\nenergy further comprise a selective transmission layer (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) adjacent to the one or more conformal solar cell(s). For instance, according to an aspect, solar energy collection antenna can comprise a selective transmission layer positioned on a side of the one or more conformal solar cell(s) (e.g., one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.) opposite the reflector structure (e.g., reflector 702). In a further aspect, selective transmission layer (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) can be adapted or configured to transmit a portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.) to the one or more conformal solar cell(s). In yet another aspect, the selective transmission layer can be further adapted or configured to reflect a portion of communications signals (e.g., one or more of incident Radio Frequency (RF) signals, incident microwave signals, or incident millimeter-", "type": "Document"}}
