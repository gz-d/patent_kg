The phase response curve from the SPR con- figuration is shown in FIG. 10, the refractive index sensing range is from 1.333RIU to 1.375RIU (ie. the dynamic range is approximately 4x10-? MU). The resolution gradually decreases from 3.57x10-\u00b0 RIU/degree to 8.41x10-\u00b0 RIU/de- gree as the refractive index moves further away from the optimized value. FIG. 11 shows the simulation results of the phase response in the wide dynamic range spectral phase- sensitive SPR sensor with the LRSPR sensing surface con- figuration. The curves from curve 1101 to curve 1115 repre- sent the spectral phase response of the sensing layer at each wavelength interval, specifically, the wavelengths of 660 nm, 665 nm, 670 nm, 674 nm, 679 nm, 684 nm, 689 nm, 694 nm, 699 nm, 704 nm, 709 nm, 714 nm, 718 nm, 723 nm, 728 nm and 733 nm, respectively. The phase response of the LRSPR configuration, as shown in FIG. 11, indicates that the resolu- tion only varies from 3.36x10-* RIU/degree to 7.73x10-* RIU/degree within the dynamic range of 4x10-? MU. Thus, the multi-wavelength spectral phase interrogating system is compatible with standard SPR and LRSPR configurations, resulting in tremendous expansion of the measurable", "type": "Document"}}
