Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may dynami- cally manipulate or control one, or two, or three, or four of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).\n\n[0110] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can simultaneously manipu- late or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may simulta- neously manipulate or control two, or three, or four, or all of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).\n\n[0111] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can independently manipu- late or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may indepen- dently manipulate or control at least two of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).\n\n[0112] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can independently, simulta- neously, and dynamically control at least two of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum).", "type": "Document"}}
