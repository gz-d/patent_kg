Examples of cell penetrating peptides commonly\n\nthereof that includes a mutation at N413 , N419 , R245 and\n\nused in the art include trans - activating transcriptional acti-\n\nR654 positions and three mutations E782K , N968K and\n\nvator ( TAT ) , penetratin , etc. The modified protein of the\n\nR1015H . In a preferred embodiment , the mutation at the\n\npresent invention can include a cell penetrating peptide\n\nN413 , N419 , R245 and / or R654 positions is a single amino\n\n40 acid substitution . In another preferred embodiment , the\n\nsequence .\n\nThe term \u201c nuclear localization sequence ' used herein\n\nmodified protein includes an alanine at the N413 position ,\n\nrefers to amino acid sequence that facilitates the transport of\n\nand / or optionally at the N419 , R245 and R654 positions .\n\nproteins into the nucleus of a cell . Examples known in the\n\nPreferably , the kit further comprises ORNA that guides the\n\nart include SV40 large T antigen NLS and nucleoplasmin\n\nmodified Cas9 protein of the invention to cut a target gene\n\nNLS . The modified protein of the present invention can 45 at a specific location on a target DNA molecule of a cell . The\n\ninclude , alternatively or in addition to the cell penetrating\n\ngRNA may be ligated into a vector , such as a commercially\n\navailable vector or a vector prepared and synthesized in a\n\npeptide sequence , a nuclear localization sequence .\n\nThe term \u201c affinity tag ' as used herein facilitates the\n\nlaboratory . A person skilled in the art would appreciate the\n\npurification of recombinant modified proteins , for example\n\nappropriate vector for carrying the gRNA molecule of the\n\nGST , FLAG or hexahistidine sequences . The term ' fusion 50 invention , and the conditions for inserting the gRNA mol\n\nbase editor protein ' as used herein refers to proteins that\n\necule into the vector . The presence of the gRNA and the\n\nmodified Cas9 protein provides suitable conditions for alter\n\nenable the direct conversion or editing of bases .", "type": "Document"}}
