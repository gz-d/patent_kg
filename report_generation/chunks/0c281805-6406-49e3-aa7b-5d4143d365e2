To this end, a preliminary investigation was per- formed before the examples set forth below of multi-spots thermal feedback, to understand the thermal threshold of various points around the auricular skin area for different persons. The results of the pilot study provided the practical guidance for the final configuration. 10 participants (5 male and 5 female) aged from 25 to 35 years old (Mean=31.5,\n\nUS 2023/0122309 Al\n\nSD=4.42) were used. The average skin temperature on auricular area was 33.2\u00b0 C. and the average room tempera- was 27.3\u00b0 C.\n\nture\n\n[0038] Apparatus\n\n[0059] A3D-printed earhook frame with five Peltier mod- ules was used for the pilot study. An Arduino-based thermal control system for the earhook was connected to a Surface Pro laptop through a USB cable. A processing-based graphi- cal user interface (GUI), as shown in FIG. 3 allows the participant to adjust the hot and the cold stimuli to a perceivable and comfortable level for each of the five points on the earhook. This information ls then stored as a text file in the laptop.\n\n[0060] Procedure and Task", "type": "Document"}}
