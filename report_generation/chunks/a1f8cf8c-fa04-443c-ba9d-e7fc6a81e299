The heated mixture may then be allowed to cool down to room tem- perature, before being filtered, washed (e.g., with water, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, and dichloromethane) and dried to obtain the COF. Without wishing to be bound by theories, it is believed that the synthesis in the present embodiment achieves a product yield of about 65% to about 85%.\n\n[0054] Ina preferred embodiment, the COF is BHT-BQ- COF (i.e. the COF with a structural representation of For- mula (1)), which is constructed of dithioether-linked benzo- quinone moieties:\n\na o soo \u3001 8 s s s 8 8 8 8 O. 8 O Ss 0 s o oO S 1 8 8 8 ~ \u2122s \u00a7 8 S o o S 0O' 8 oO s OO 8 8 8 8 i s s 8 \u201ctls 0 S\u3001_\u3001 a > ALL.\n\n[0055] FIG.1 shows the synthesis of BHT-BQ-COF which involves a cross-coupling reaction between a halogen-sub- stituted quinone and an aromatic thiol. In the illustrated embodiment, the aromatic thiol is 1,2,3,4,5,6-benzenehexa- thiol (BHT), and the halogen-substituted quinone is a tetra- halogen-substituted benzoquinone (THBQ), e.g., 2,3,5,6- tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone (TFBQ) or 2,3,5,6- tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ). They are mixed with sodium carbonate as the base and n-butanol as the solvent in the step of mixing, before being degassed and heated at 120\u00b0 C. for 72 hours.", "type": "Document"}}
