The cell nuclei\n\nare visualized by pre-staining them with fluorescence Hoechst 33342 and the cell density is diluted to a sufficiently low level (about 104 nuclei/mL) for avoiding cell aggrega- tion along the microfluidic channel 502. The cells 504, 506, are injected into the microfluidic device with a driving pressure of 100 Pa, and microscopic images of the captured. cells 504, 506 in the microfluidic channel 502 are taken to obtain parameters F,, Wi Do rz and De Next, the driving pressure is increased to 400 Pa and microscopic images of the captured cells 504, 506 are taken again to obtain parameters F, and W,. Afterward, the driving pres- sure is increased to 1 kPa to recollect all the captured cells 504, 506 at the outlet of the microfluidic device for any\n\nfurther analysis.\n\n[0093] FIG. 5C illustrates a bar graph showing the whole cell elasticity of NP460 cell 504 and NPC43 cell 506. The parameters obtained from the microscopic images are used. to calculate the elastic modulus of the whole cells NP460 and NPC43 using Equations (3)-(7) above. As shown in the bar graph, the elastic modulus of the cells under driving pressure of 400 Pa are significantly higher than the elastic modulus of the cells under driving pressure of 100 Pa, confirming the modulus jumps for both NP460 and NPC43 cells.\n\nmicroscopic\n\nimages\n\nillustrates\n\n[0094]\n\nFIG.\n\n5D", "type": "Document"}}
