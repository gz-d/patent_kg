No.: 12/624,562\n\n(57) ABSTRACT\n\n(22) Filed: Nov. 24, 2009\n\nProvided is a circuit for an electronic device having a non- planar transparent resonator. The transparent resonator is mounted on said circuit so as to at least partially occupy a footprint of another component of the circuit. The transparent resonator forms part of a light pathway on said circuit for transmitting light to or from said another component. Also provided is a transparent dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) for optical applications. Since the DRA is transparent, it can let light pass through itself and, thus, the light can be utilized by an optical part of a system or device. The transparent DRA can be placed on top of a solar cell. Since the DRA does not block the light, the light can reach the solar cell panel and power can be generated for the system or device. The system or device so obtained is very compact because no extra foot- print is needed within the system or device for the DRA. It finds application in compact wireless applications that need a self-sustaining device.\n\n(65) Prior Publication Data\n\nUS 2011/0122036 Al May 26, 2011\n\n(51) Int.
