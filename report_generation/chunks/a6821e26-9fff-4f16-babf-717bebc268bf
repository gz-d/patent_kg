The correction device of claim 1, wherein the supere- lastic material has a transition temperature within the range of body temperature.\n\n3. The correction device of claim 1, wherein the supere- lastic material comprises a nickel-titanium alloy.\n\n4. The correction device of claim 1, wherein the first and second support member (10) comprises a pair of supporting rods.\n\n45\n\n5. The correction device of claim 4, wherein the trans- verse traction member (32) is a cross-link element joined between the supporting rods.\n\n50", "type": "Document"}}
