Apoptosis\n\na single 90-mm Petri dish coated with 0.3% agarose and washed three times in an embryo culture medium. Dechori- onation is done under a stereomicroscope by using a pair 0. forceps to tear off the chorion. The embryos are then trans- ferred to a 15-ml culture tube filled with 8-ml trypsin solution (0.5 mg/ml trypsin in a solution of 0.14M of NaCl, 0.05M of KCI, 0.005M of glucose, 0.007M of NaHCO, and 0.7 mM o: EDTA). Then the embryos are to be triturated through a narrow bore Pasteur pipette until they are dissociated with continuous checking under a dissection microscope. The cel. suspension is then centrifuged at 1000xg for 7 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant is discarded and cells are resuspended in 5 ml PBS to wash away the trypsin. They are then centrifuged again at 1000xg for 7 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., followed by resuspen- sion in 5 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 1000xg for 7 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The aqueous solution is discarded, and the pellet is then resuspended completely in 200 ul of PBS. Following this, 2 ml of 70% ethanol is added and the mixture is incu- bated at -20\u00b0 C. overnight. The sample is then centrifuged at 1000xg for 7 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. and pellet is added with 100 wl of propidium iodide (400 pg/ml) and 100 ul of RNase (1 mg/ml), incubated at 28.5\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes before flow\n\nf.
