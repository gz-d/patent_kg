A method for collecting and employing solar energy proximate to a communications antenna:\n\ntransmitting at least a portion of incident solar radiation at a selective transmission layer of the communications antenna to at least one solar cell on a reflector of the communications antenna;\n\nenergy communications antenna is further configured as a horn antenna.\n\n3. The solar energy collection antenna of claim 1, the selective transmission layer comprises a grid of at least one metal, a metal wire, or a metallic composition.\n\nreflecting at least a portion of at least one of an incident Radio Frequency (RF) signal, an incident microwave signal, or an incident millimeter-wave signal to create a reflected communications signal;\n\n4. The solar energy collection antenna of claim 3, the grid is further configured, relative to predetermined wavelengths of the incident solar radiation and the reflected communica- tions signals, with a grid spacing adapted to at least one of aid. reflection of the incident RF signals, the incident microwave signals, or the incident millimeter-wave signals or aid trans- mission of the incident solar radiation. 45 50\n\ncollecting at least a portion of the reflected communica- tions signal by at least one antenna element associated with the communications antenna; and\n\nconverting at least a portion of the at least a portion of incident solar radiation into an electrical potential for use by the communications antenna.\n\n5. The solar energy collection antenna of claim 1, the reflector structure is further configured as a non-planar reflec- tor structure.\n\n16.
