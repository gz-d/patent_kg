The results revealed that the titanium surfaces treated with 50 Hz and 100 Hz oxygen plasma treatment (Figs. 6B and 6C, respectively) are well tolerated by mammalian cells as compared with the untreated titani- um (Fig. 6 A) after 3 days of culturing. In another embodiment, a pressurized hydro- [0033] thermal treatment can be applied to establish reactive functional groups exhibiting antimicrobial functions. For example, implantable titanium alloy with other reactive functional groups such as -OXHY (where x and y are nat- ural numbers) exhibiting antimicrobial functions can be achieved by the pressurized hydrothermal treatment. In yet another embodiment, PIII&D can be used to form a reactive functional amide group (for example -NH2) on the titanium alloy surface. For example, nitrogen, oxygen, and ammonia PIII&D can be performed under various conditions (including concentration of implanted ele- ments, implantation voltage and frequency, treatment time, and temperature) to form the reactive functional amide groups on the titanium alloy surface. [0034] However, the reactive function group layer is not functional groups. For example, these reactive functional groups can be regarded as an intermediate surface to facilitate", "type": "Document"}}
