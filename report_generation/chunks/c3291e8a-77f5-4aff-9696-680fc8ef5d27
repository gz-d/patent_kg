The shaded area emphasizes the H1-H2 coexisting region. The dashed line separates the voltage range of the H2 and H3 phase.\n\n[0019] FIG. 12 shows contour plots of the PGE-NCM811 along with the related voltage profile.\n\n[0020] FIG. 13a-13d are SEM images of the electrodes after 100 cycles for the pristine (FIGS. 13a-13b) and PGE- NCM811 materials (FIGS. 13c-d). The whole electrodes disassembled from the cell are shown in the insets. The crack areas in the pristine NCM811 electrode are highlighted with circles in FIG. 13d.\n\n[0021] FIG. 14 shows the calculated partial density states for the original R-3m (upper) and distorted C2/m (below) structures. The dashed line shows the position of the Fermi level.\n\nof\n\n[0022] FIGS. 15a-c show the local structural distortion induced from the Ni-ion oxidation. FIG. 15a shows typical low-r PDF patterns of the pristine and PGE-NCM811 mate- rials. The arrows direct the peak splitting related to the octahedron distortion. The inset shows the elongated octa- hedra after engineering. FIG. 154 shows the PDF refinement patterns for pristine (upper) and PGE (middle and bottom) materials with different structural models. FIG. 15c is a schematic diagram of the secondary particles consisting of R-3m grains and C/2m grain boundaries.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n[0023]\n\nThe hexagonal structure of Ni-rich NCM materials", "type": "Document"}}
