A system for calculating the sum of squared differences between an original block S and a reconstructed block Ro image or video data; the system comprising:\n\na) a processor having a predicting module for predicting a predicted block P, corresponding to an original block o. data S, by using inter or intra prediction,\n\n10. A method according to claim 9, wherein said rate- distortion is calculated by the formula J,,=SSD+A-R, where Jgp is a parameter representing the rate distortion, SSD is the sum of squared differences computed in step (e), R is the number of bits required to entropy encode the block, and is a Lagrange multiplier.\n\nb) the processor also having a residual block defining mod- ule for calculating a residual block D, which is the dif- ference between said predicted block P and said origina block S,\n\n11. A method of encoding video or image data, the metl comprising the steps of:\n\nc) the processor further having a transform module for performing an integer image transform on said residua block D to obtaina transformed residual block F* having a plurality of co-efficients fi\n\ndefining an area in a frame of video or image data,\n\ncalculating the rate-distortion which would be caused encoding said area according to a first encoding mode, said rate-distortion being calculated by using the method of claim 9,\n\nthe processor still further having an inverse quantization module for finding a plurality of coefficients fy , the coefficients \u2122,, being defined by the equation \u00a3,-Q\" Q (f*,,)), where Q is an operator which performs quantiz- ing and Q\u201d! is the inverse of the Q operator,\n\ncomparing said rate-distortion with the rate-distortion which would be caused by encoding said area according to a second encoding mode,", "type": "Document"}}
