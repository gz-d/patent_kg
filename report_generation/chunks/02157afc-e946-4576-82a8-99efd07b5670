As shown in FIG. 14, for U,C,, dataset where the depth video was distorted, conventional 2D metrics TW-SSIM and MSSSIM perform better than other benchmark schemes. This is because the depth distortion causes the geometrical distortion in the rendered view, and conventional 2D metric, such as PSNR, may overestimate the geometrical distortion. The performance of LOGS, a metric proposed for 3D synthesized image, follows the IW-SSIM and MSSSIM. The PLCC and SROCC values of Liu and the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodiment are much higher than all the rest methods. The method of the present embodiment has the highest performance with dominant superiority. This indicates that the method of the present embodiment can predict the flicker distortion very well and have better consistency with human perception. For CU, three 2D quality metrics |W-SSIM, WSNR, and VQM are good, since they are designed for compression and structural distortion for 2D images/videos which are probably the main distor- tions in C,U,. All the 3D synthesized image/video metrics didn\u2019t perform well except Liu and the method of the present embodiment. This is because the other methods have not considered the distortion induced by the compressed texture videos. Similar to U;Cp, the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodiment performs the best in term of the PLCC, SROCC and RMSE. Similarly, on C7C,, the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodiment performs the best among them while Liu and IW-SSIM have very similar perfor- mance, and MSSSIM and SSIM perform fairly good and are better than other methods. In the ALL dataset, [W-SSIM ranks third after Liu and the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodiment. Liu\u2019s method ranks the second while\n\nD.
