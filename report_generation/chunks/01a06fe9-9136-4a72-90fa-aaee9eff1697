In a first embodiment of the invention the energy [0021] receiving element consists of a winding 1 wound around and within the thickness of a thin soft magnetic sheet 2 a small AC capacitor 3, a diode rectifier 4 and a DC link capacitor 5. The soft magnetic sheet 2 may be square, rectangular or other polygonal shapes as shown in Fig. 11(a), or may be circular or oval as shown in Fig.11(b). Winding 1 and soft magnetic sheet 2 form an energy pick- up coil or inductor as shown in Fig.11(a) or 11(b), which then forms a resonant tank with the small resonant ca- pacitor. When sensing a high-frequency AC magnetic flux flowing perpendicularly (or vertically) from the sur- face of the planar inductive battery charging platform, the energy pick-up coil will, develop a n AC voltage by Far- aday\u2019s law and picks up the energy transmitted from a planar charging platform. This coil enclosing the soft magnetic sheet (as a low-profile magnetic core) is es- sentially a planar inductor. This planar inductor and the series-connected AC capacitor form a series resonant tank that can amplify the AC voltage for the diode rectifier. The diode rectifier and the DC capacitor rectify the AC voltage into a DC voltage that can be fed to a battery charging circuit. Preferably a voltage regulator can be used to provide a stable DC voltage from the output of", "type": "Document"}}
