The another com- ponent may be an optical component that is arranged to gen- erate light for transmission via the light pathway or to process ight received thereat via said light pathway. The DR may be shaped so as to focus light impinging on a surface thereof. Preferably, the material comprising the DR is transparent to ight at and/or beyond optical frequencies, i.e. visible and/or invisible light frequencies. More preferably, the material of the DR comprises borosilicate glass. Preferably, the glass is borosilicate crown glass, commonly known by the trade- names \u201cPyrex\u201d or \u201cK9\u201d. The DR may be shaped such that ight impinging on a surface of said DR is focused by the DR. The DR may be hemispherical in shape with a surface defin- ing the hemispherical shape comprising the light impinging surface, although any suitable lens shape that acts to focus ight may be utilised. The DR may be shaped such that light impinging on a surface of said DR is focused by the DR\n\nReferring to FIG. 1a and 14, a first embodiment ofa circuit 10 including a DRA 12 in accordance with the invention is described. This embodiment of a DRA 12 comprises a non- focusing transparent rectangular DR 16. As a rectangular DR is mechanically easier to fabricate than other shapes, it is of great interest to antenna engineers.", "type": "Document"}}
