The sensor component 214, utilizing the sensor array, can detect the optical signals (e.g., 208, 210, 212) being presented by the control region of the projector screen component 202. The barrier control com- ponent 206 can analyze a detected optical signal and identify the type of optical signal, type of video content, type of barrier pattern mode, type of barrier pattern, and/or type of display mode associated with the detected optical signal to facilitate automatically and dynamically controlling switching or\n\nthe (e.g.,", "type": "Document"}}
