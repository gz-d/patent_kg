The second processor is electrically connected the first processor, the audio source and the signal output, and the second input device is electrically connected to the second processor. The second input device is configured to generate a second controlling signal to the second processor, and the second processor adjusts enhancement weights of a vocal group and an instrumental group of the first audio signal based on the second controlling signal and the hearing rofile.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the signal output includes one or more dominant electrodes. The first processor enhances stimulations by the dominant electrodes through the second audio signal, and the dominant elec- trodes corresponds to signals range from 212 Hz to 1.4 kHz.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, loudspeakers (e.g., speakers, headphones, earphones, headsets, earbuds, ete.) are used with a playback device executing the audio signal processing software or with a dedicated hardware device that resides in between and signal-connected to both the loudspeakers and the output of an audio source.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, a microphone be used to feed input (e.g., live input) of acoustic sources into the system for real time processing of musical sources.\n\ncan\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nAccording to one aspect of the present invention, a method for processing audio signals, such as music signals, includes: processing audio signals based on a hearing profile obtained from a user of a hearing device, the hearing profile may be stored in and retrievable from a non-transient memory device; and providing the processed audio signals to the user via an acoustic device.", "type": "Document"}}
