The schematic of the primary induction system is shown in Figs4(a) and (b).\n\nThe induction system can be powered by AC or DC power sources. If the power supply is the AC mains, the switched mode power electronic circuit should perform a low-frequency (50 or 60Hz) AC to DC power conversion and then DC to high-frequency (typically in the range from 20kHz to |OMHz) AC power conversion. This high-frequency AC voltage will feed the primary winding or windings of the primary induction circuit. If the power supply is a DC voltage source (e.g. a battery), the switched mode power supply should perform a DC to high-frequency AC power conversion. The high-frequency voltage is fed to the primary winding or windings of the transformer.\n\nr\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nThe induction system is able to induce current in the secondary clement or elements.
