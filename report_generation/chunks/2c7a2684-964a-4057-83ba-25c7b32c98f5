For infection, mice were injected intraperitoneally with approximately 10\u00b0* TCID,, of JEV. For the berbamine treatment group, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 50 mg/kg berbamine or PBS daily. For the control- vehicle group, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 50 mg/kg PBS daily. Survival rate and change of body weight if the mice in each group were monitored for 15 days after JEV injection.\n\n[0095] As shown in FIGS. 9C and 9D, berbamine treat- ment increases the survival rate of the mice, i.e. protect the mice from the lethal challenge of JEV. The higher survival rate and less weight changes in berbamine treatment group, as compared to the control group, further suggest that berbamine is a potential anti-flavivirus drug against JEV.\n\nInhibitory Effect of Berbamine and its Analogues Against Other RNA Virus Infection\n\n[0096] In addition, other than flavivirus infection, inventors determined whether berbamine has any antiviral effect against enterovirus and lentivirus infection, by apply- the same high-content image based assay as discussed above.\n\n[0092] As shown in FIG. 8A, all these compounds have demonstrated an inhibitory effect against JEV infection in A549 host cells. Among them, 4 compounds including Compound #1, #7, #9 and #11 exhibited highest potency. As shown in FIG. 8B, these 4 compounds can effectively block the entry of JEV into the host cells.\n\n[0097] As shown in FIG. 10, berbamine treatment of cells significantly inhibited EV-A71 infection, with ECso being around 17 uM.", "type": "Document"}}
