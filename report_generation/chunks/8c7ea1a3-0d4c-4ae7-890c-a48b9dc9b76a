The electron beam is typically gener- ated by an electron gun in the microscope. The focus of the electron beam is then modified by an electromagnetic \u201clens system\u201d. A deflector, in the form of coil(s), is energized (adjustable) to move the electron beam in first and second scanning directions in the same plane for scanning the specimen. The orthogonal degree between the two scanning directions or lines, generally referred to as orthogonality, is an important parameter that determines the quality of the image produced. In operation, orthogonality should be con- trolled such that the two scanning directions or lines can be regarded as being orthogonal to each other (as close to 90 degrees as possible) in order to minimize image distortion. The manufacture tolerance and assembly error of the deflec- tor may complicate the achievement of this object.\n\n[0009] In this first aspect, the predetermined equations may include\n\nA=A-B'sin \u4e2d\n\nB=Breos >\n\nwhere A\u2019 is a detected amplitude of a drive signal in the first scanning direction, B' is a detected amplitude of a drive signal in the second scanning direction, A is a required amplitude of a drive signal in the first reference scanning direction, B is a required amplitude of a drive signal in the second reference scanning direction, \u4e2d is a deviation angle between the second scanning direction and the second reference scanning direction. The control signal is arranged to control the deflector based on A and B.\n\n[0010] In this first aspect, the predetermined equations may include\n\nA=A-Besin \u7531\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nB-B'", "type": "Document"}}
