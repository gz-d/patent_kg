In one aspect, the output electrical signals of each microgesture are regarded as one cluster. Specifically, for a specific wearing angle, a better gesture distinguishability leads to a larger between-clusters dispersion in the latent space, while a good feature stability across different wearers precipitates a small inter-cluster dispersion in a latent space. It should be noted that a CH Index indicates a between-clusters dispersion and inter-cluster dispersion of the output electrical signal clus- ters.
