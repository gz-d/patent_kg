Then, the substrate 140 having a single-layer of\n\n[0046]\n\nReS, deposited thereon is taken out of the tube furnace 110 and placed into a chamber equipped with ultraviolet (UV) lights. Preferably, the chamber is equipped with two UV lamps respectively set to emit UV lights at the wavelengths of 254 nm and 185 nm; more preferably, the UV light of 185 nm accounts only about 10% of the total UV light in the chamber. According to embodiments of the present disclo- sure, the substrate 140 is irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in the chamber described above in the condition where humidity is about 30-80% (e.g., 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% humidity), and in the presence of an inert gas (e.g., N,, argon, etc) for a period of 60-450 seconds (e.g., 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, or 450 seconds) to induce formation of the desired wrinkle patter on the single-layer of ReS,. In one preferred embodiment, the irradiation is performed in the chamber described above at a humidity level of 60% in the presence of nitrogen for about 180 seconds to indued wrinkles on the single-layer of ReS,. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, increasing exposure time to UV lights and/or humidity level will produce much denser wrinkle pattern structure and lower photoluminescence (PL) inten- sity. Such substrate, that is, the substrate having a wrinkle\n\npattern of single-layer of ReS, thereon prepared in accor-\n\nDec. 29, 2022\n\ndance with the method described above, may be used, for example, in the field of electronic devices, photovoltaic devices, optoelectronic devices etc.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1: Preparation of a Mica Substrate Having a Wrinkle Pattern of Single-layer ReS, Deposited Thereon", "type": "Document"}}
