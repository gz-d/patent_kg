The power generator (i.e. thermoelectric device 100, 200) generates power i.e. an electric current by harvesting body heat. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 as described herein provides a small por- table power source that does not include chemicals like batteries, thereby making the thermoelectric device 100, 200 inherently safer. The device 100, 200 is also less prone to explosions due to physical damage or high temperatures. The wearable power generator (thermoelectric device 100, 200) provides a flexible device that can be wrapped about structures e.g. a user\u2019s limbs without breaking or cracking, unlike traditional thermoelectric generators that utilise rigid ceramic plates.\n\n[0161] The thermoelectric device 100, 200 is advanta- geous because high temperatures generate a greater current and power. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 as described herein is also of a simple construction. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 as described herein utilises a flexible substrate and is flexible enough to conform to a user\u2019s limbs. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 is also robust due to the flexible substrate and the in-plane construction. The semi- conductor elements and conductor members comprise a thin film construction thereby making the device more robust and provides a device with a small footprint. The device 100, 200 also provides a thin wearable power source.\n\n[0157] The rows of adjacent, interconnected thermoelec- tric modules are arranged such that the longitudinal axis or each row is parallel with the other rows. The plurality of semiconductor elements are arranged in rows of intercon- nected semiconductor elements. As shown in FIG. 2A and 2B, there are three parallel rows of interconnected semicon- ductor elements. The rows are interconnected by conductor elements.", "type": "Document"}}
