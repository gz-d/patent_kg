A diluted solution in the solution tank 110 is pumped via pump 112 into the solution channel 50 of the reactor 10. A heat source (e.g., solar energy or waste energy) 130 generates heat that heats the liquid (e.g., water) in the liquid channel 30. Thermally driven by the heated liquid produced from the heat source, the diluted solution generates vapor- ized refrigerant whilst flowing inside the solution channel 50. The vaporized refrigerant passes through the porous membrane 45 and enters the refrigerant channel 40. Cooled by the cooling water produced from heat sink 140 (e.g., a cooling tower or evaporative cooler), the vaporized refrig- erant is condensed into liquid refrigerant in the refrigerant channel 40 and then flows into the refrigerant tank 120. The diluted solution becomes concentrated after the vapor gen- eration process and flows back to the solution tank 110. As the solution becomes increasingly concentrated, the thermal energy is stored in the form of thermochemical energy via solution concentration in the solution tank 110.\n\nthe\n\nglide\n\nUS 2023/0075850 Al\n\n[0031] With its selectivity characteristic, the porous mem- brane 45 separates the feed solution into a retentate (con- centrated solution) and a permeate (refrigerant) by control- ling the movement of molecules across the membrane. Vaporized refrigerant is separated from the solution due to the vapor refrigerant pressure difference even at low driving temperatures. Thus, the desorption (generation) process occurs before the solution is heated to the boiling point, making it possible to apply low-grade energy in the mem- brane-based thermochemical energy storage system. These low-grade energy sources are typically unusable in conven- tional systems, resulting in wasted energy.", "type": "Document"}}
