A surgical implant comprising:\n\n50\n\n55\n\na titanium alloy modified by a plasma treatment and having a controllable release antimicrobial peptide coating disposed on the surface of the modified titanium alloy, wherein the controllable release antimicrobial peptide coating has a controllable release mechanism for the antimicrobial peptide that is triggered by an incoming bacterial attack, wherein the controllable release antimicrobial peptide coating includes stable antimicrobial peptides having a cleavable mechanism that is triggered by protease released by incoming bac-\n\n6\n\n11\n\nEP 2 398 517 B1\n\n12\n\nteria, and wherein the surface of the modified titanium alloy is compatible with mammalian cells.\n\n2. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the modified titanium alloy is able to resist bacterial attachment and growth on its surface.\n\n5\n\n11. The surgical implant according to claim 10, wherein release of antimicrobial peptides from the controlla- ble release antimicrobial peptide coating is triggered by breakdown of the linker molecules, wherein the breakdown of linker molecules is triggered by incom- ing bacteria.\n\n3. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein original mechanical properties of the titanium alloy are not altered by the plasma treatment and antimi- crobial peptide coating.\n\n4. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the modified titanium alloy is configured for implan- tation in orthopaedic, cardiovascular, or dental op- erations.", "type": "Document"}}
