As shown in Fig.2, the induction system consists of two units, namely (1) a power delivering inductive circuit that contains the primary circuit of an array of planar isolation transformer windings and (2) a secondary element that couples energy from the primary inductive circuit. In the context of an induction cooker, the secondary element may be a metallic pan 1, while the first element is the induction heating surface 2 on which the pan is to be\n\nplaced.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of primary transformer windings are located in the primary inductive circuit, and preferably in the form of an array as shown in Fig.3 The windings may be circular, rectangular, hexagonal, square or any polygonal shape.
