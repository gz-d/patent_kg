FIG. 3B illustrates diagrams of a captured whole cell 302 in a microfluidic channel 304 under a large deformation in accordance with the same embodiment shown in FIG. 3A. A whole cell 302 includes two major cell components: cyto- plasm 306 and nucleus 308. Considering that elasticity of the nucleus 308 is often higher than that of the cytoplasm 306 in the whole cell 302, modulus difference (denoted as E\\ cleus) between the nuclear modulus Eee and the cytoplasmic modulus \u4e86 Er\u3002 is therefore \u5df2, E) weteus: Contributions of the nuclear modulus E,,,,.iers am the cytoplasmic modulus Eve to the elastic modulus of the whole cell E under the small and large deformations are presented in FIG. 3A (small deformation) and FIG. 3B (large\n\ndeformation).\n\n[0074] The processor calculates the elastic modulus of the whole cell E under the small and large deformations by considering a force balanced state of the captured whole cell 302 and the hyperelastic Tatara model using the following equation:\n\nei + OD. - 8D? + D2 ( op? ] (4) 4 De om (8D? + 2D2\u00a5\u00b0?
