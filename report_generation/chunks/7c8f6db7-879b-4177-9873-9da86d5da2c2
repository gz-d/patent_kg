For example, the EMSHMM of the instant invention allows data analysis and modeling for cognitive tasks involving cognitive state changes and provides better predictions and analysis of subject behavior and cognitive processes. Furthermore, the methods of the invention allow data analysis ln tasks and cognitive behaviors that involve stimuli with different layouts, including, but not limited to, website viewing, information visual and other tasks.\n\nsystem usage,\n\nsearch, driving,\n\ncomplex\n\nIn specific embodiments of the invention, the data may be received from any type of eye tracking mechanism, whether optical, electrical, magnetic, or otherwise that calculate the eye gaze position of a human eye.

In preferred embodiments, eye tracking patterns are collected using video camera images.\n\nIn some embodiments, the data received from the eye tracking mechanisms are used in a Hidden Markov model. A Hidden Markov model is a statistical model used primarily to recover a data sequence that is not immediately observable. The model derives probability values for the unobservable data sequence by interpreting other data that depend on that sequence and are immediately observable.", "type": "Document"}}
