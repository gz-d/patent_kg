These FPGA may also provide soft cores for TCAM to support its applications, but the memory utilization may be inefficient in some examples. Some emulated TCAMs may support the SDNs however lack efficient usage of memory resources on FPGA,\n\n[0027] FIGS. 3A to 3E are illustrations of conversion of LUTRAMs into TCAMs based on different emulating rules;\n\n[0028] FIGS. 4A and 4B are block diagrams showing building block of D-TCAM;\n\n[0029] FIGS. 5A and 5B are illustrations showing expan- sions of D-TCAM using two D-CAM blocks connected in parallel form or in cascade form;\n\n[0038] For example, some FPGAs may not have a hard IP support TCAM. Alternatively, emulated TCAMs may be used by utilizing the memory resources inside FPGAs, these emulated TCAMs may be considered as FPGA-based. CAMs.\n\n[0030] FIG. 6 is an illustration showing horizontal and vertical expansion of a D-TCAM using four D-CAM blocks;\n\n[0031] FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram showing LUT-FF pairs and the pipeline memory structure of the memory device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\n\n[0039] In some alternatively examples, TCAMs may be implemented based on application-specific integrated cir- cuits (ASICs), however ASICs may be less preferable in some applications as these devices may have low storage density, less reconfigurable, and challenging to integrate with FPGA-based systems.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION", "type": "Document"}}
