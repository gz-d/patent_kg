For each block in the area the rate distortion (R-D cost) is determined by using the method of FIG. 10. The rate distortion of each of the blocks in the area is then added together to determine the rate distortion caused by encoding the area according to the first encoding mode. In step 730 the same procedure is carried out as in step 720, except fora second encoding mode. In step 740 the respective rate distortions caused by encoding the area according to the first and second encoding modes are com- pared. The encoding mode giving the lowest rate distortion is thus found. In step 750 the area is encoded according to the selected encoding mode (or alternatively the data which has already been encoded according to that mode in step 650 of FIG. 10 is output).", "type": "Document"}}
