Also and note that V,, and I, are in phase as shown in FIG. 19().\n\nEquation (12) is the important equation which shows that the input inductance Ls can be used to reduce the change of average output load current AI, fora given change in the input AC mains voltage AV s. Take an example. For an AC mains of 50 Hz, the angular frequency m is equal to 100m, that is 314.16. Foran Ls of 1H, the effect of input voltage fluctuation on the output average current will be reduced by 314.16 times as shown in (12). For an Ls of 2H, the reduction will be 618 times. For this sensitivity control to be effective, the size of the input inductor Ls has to be reasonably large (typically near to or in the order of Henry).\n\n(a)\n\nVols cos $F ols\n\nYai is the fundamental component\n\npower output power of the valley-fill circuit, assuming that the power loss in the diode rectifier and valley-fill circuit is negligible.\n\nIn order to provide a conducting path for the inductor current in Ls in case there is any problem in other part of the circuit which may create a discontinuation of current, a capacitor Cs can be placed to the second end of the input inductor as shown in FIG. 22. This LsCs arrangement will also play the additional role of input filter. But the main purpose of using a \u201clarge\u201d Ls here is to reduce the sensitivity of the output load current (and thus output load power) of the proposed circuit to input voltage fluctuation.\n\nv7 .3y.7 Peed (3) VsIgcos = Vsle = 7 Miclo = TER + loo\n\nIf the inductor winding resistance is negligible, R=0. to\n\n3 6 Vo = 3 Mec \u00a9\n\nIn order to relate T with Vs, we start with modifying (9) with the help of (7b) and (8) gives:\n\nUsing Fourier analysis on the waveform of V,, the funda- mental component V,, of V, can be determined as:", "type": "Document"}}
