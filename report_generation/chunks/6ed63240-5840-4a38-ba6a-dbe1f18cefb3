A feed source emits radiation which is incident on the first discrete dielectric metalens. A z-axis translator changes the relative inter-lens position of the first and second discrete dielectric metalenses to move a position of a focused beam along the z-axis. The position of the focused beam is scannable within a three-dimensional cylindrical space.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0008] FIGS. 1(a)-1(4) depict perspective and side views, respectively of an antenna according to an embodiment;\n\n[0009] FIG. 2 depicts the configuration of a dielectric post element;\n\n[0010] FIGS. 3(a) and 3(4) schematically depict the con- figuration of dielectric elements on the upper and lower lenses;\n\n[0011] FIGS. 4(a) and 4(4) depict height distributions for dielectric post elements on the lower and upper lenses;\n\n[0012] FIG. 5 depicts simulated and measured far-field radiation patterns of the lower lens at 300 GHz,\n\n[0013] FIG. 6(a)-6(c) depicts orientations of the upper and lower lenses and their corresponding simulated and mea- sured power densities on the focal plane for focus radial steering:\n\n[0014] FIG. 7 depicts simulated and measured power densities along the line x=0 mm on the focal plane for focus radial steering at 300 GHz;\n\n[0015] FIGS. 8(a)-8(c) depict orientations of the upper and lower lenses and their corresponding simulated and measured power densities on the focal plane for focus azimuth steering;", "type": "Document"}}
