Furthermore, the invention relates to an output compensator circuit that is not required to process the whole of the load power of the regulator and thus is a low power circuit relative to the power rating of the regulator.\n\nSince the 1970\u2019s, many research articles have been devoted to different control schemes such as voltage-mode control, current-mode control, nonlinear control, one-cycle control, sliding-mode control, etc. for the controller. To further improve voltage regulation capability and dynamic response, low dropout regulators (LDRs) have been widely used in post regulation of switching regulators. LDRs are linear regulators operating with very small input-output differential voltage. Although they have low power loss, they necessitate process- ing the entire load power of the voltage regulator. The series pass element in the LDRs has to carry the whole of the voltage regulator load current. Consequently, LDRs as a means of compensating the output signal of a voltage regulator are more suitable for low-power voltage regulation applications.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nLinear regulators are commonly used for step-down (e.g. the output supply voltage is lower than input source voltage) applications.", "type": "Document"}}
