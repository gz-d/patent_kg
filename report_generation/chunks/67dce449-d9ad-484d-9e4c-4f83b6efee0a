The microchannel membrane-based reactor offers a large specific surface area and integrates solution/refrigerant flows, which enables formation of a highly compact reactor exhibiting strong heat/mass transfer. In some embodiments, direct diffusion of water molecules through the membrane makes it possible to lower the required charging tempera- tures.\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention presents\n\n[0012]\n\na thermochemical energy storage system. The system includes a membrane-based thermochemical reactor. The reactor includes a solution channel having an absorbent- containing solution flowing therethrough and a refrigerant channel with a refrigerant flowing therethrough along with first and second fluid channels. A porous membrane is positioned between the refrigerant channel and the solution channel; the porous membrane permits flow of vapor mol- ecules therethrough while restricting flow of absorbent mol- ecules. The system further includes a solution storage repository ln fluid communication with the solution channel and a refrigerant repository in fluid communication with the channel.\n\nrefrigerant", "type": "Document"}}
