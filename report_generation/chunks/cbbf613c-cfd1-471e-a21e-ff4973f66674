The choice of the capacitors used in the valley-fill circuit can be made so that non-electrolytic capacitors can be used. Unlike previous applications, the valley-fill circuit is used in embodiments of this invention to reduce the output voltage ripple which in turn will reduce the current ripple in the later power stage. This aspect of the valley-fill circuit application has not been reported previously because in the prior art valley-fill circuits were primarily used for voltage source applications and were used as a means for input power factor correction with their outputs are nominally connected directly to another power converter or a load. For example, in the National Semiconductor Note: LM3445 Triac Dimmable Offline LED Driver March 2009, the two capaci- tors C7 and C9 in the valley-fill circuit are electrolytic capaci- tors and the valley-fill circuit provides a \u201cvoltage source\u201d to a buck converter which in turn controls the power of the LED load. Such example of valley-fill circuit application high- lights the traditional use of \u201celectrolytic capacitor\u201d in absorb- ing large power variation and the voltage source nature of rior art.\n\nFIG. 16 shows a diode-clamp that may be added to each LED string in embodiments of the invention;\n\nFIGS. 17(a) and (5) illustrate the use of the valley-fill circuit in reducing the voltage ripple;\n\nFIG. 18 shows a circuit according to a further embodiment the invention;", "type": "Document"}}
