Two common features shared by these valley-fill applications are (i) the valley-fill circuits are used primarily for shaping the input current in the AC-DC power conversion circuit for improving the power factor and (ii) use capacitors of equal capacitance value in the individual circuits.\n\nthe LED load in circuits that do not include voltage ripple reduction. FIG. 23 shows an example of such a circuit where the input inductor L, is provided in series between the AC supply voltage V, and a diode rectifier the output of which is provided directly to the load. As with the circuit of FIG. 22 a capacitor C, may be provided in parallel between the input inductor and the diode rectifier to provide a conducting path in the event of any short-circuit or other problem in another part of the circuit, and also to provide a filtering function.\n\nAs described above, valley-fill circuits are used for reduc- ing the output DC voltage ripple or variation so that a fairly constant current source can be generated with the help of a filter inductor. One preferred embodiment of such a circuit is shown in FIG. 18. In traditional applications of valley-fill circuits, the two capacitors Cl and C2 are of the same capaci- tance value. This will allow the output voltage to be smaller than that ofa diode bridge, i.e. the output voltage ripple can be reduced by about 50%.", "type": "Document"}}
