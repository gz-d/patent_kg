The axis of reflection symmetry may be parallel to or collinear with a long axis of the transmission line of the even-mode-shorted coupler.\n\n[0024] In some embodiments, the patch antenna arrange- ment comprises an on-chip patch antenna arrangement.\n\n[0025] In some embodiments, the first patch element electrically coupled (e.g., capacitively coupled) with the third circuit arrangement of the first oscillator and the third circuit arrangement of the second oscillator.\n\n[0026] In some embodiments, the second patch element electrically coupled (e.g., capacitively coupled) with the fourth circuit arrangement of the first oscillator and the fourth circuit arrangement of the second oscillator.\n\n[0027] Insome embodiments, the first transistor of the first oscillator and the first transistor of the second oscillator are arranged to selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the first patch element. For example, in one cycle, the first transistor of the first oscillator may provide third harmonic power to the first patch element for about half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously), and the first tran- sistor of the second oscillator may provide third harmonic power to the first patch element for about another half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously).", "type": "Document"}}
