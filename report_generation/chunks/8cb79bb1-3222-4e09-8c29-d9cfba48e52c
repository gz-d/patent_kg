For example, in one of the most commonly used fabrication processes, replication, the inevi- table formation of uncontrolled cracks and subsequent struc- tural failure, as a result of the presence of deadlocking region in the transfer of hierarchical structures. Previous studies have also shown that proper control of crack forma- tion in rigid materials (e.g., hexagonal BN, SiN, Pt, and Si) can give rise to useful functionalities such as atomic-scale pattern formation. Inspired by these studies, the inventors hypothesize that the controllable formation and configur- ability of cracks in elastic materials might be utilized to achieve more diverse structures and functions otherwise impossible to realize using state-of-art facilities. Herein, the inventor develop a new technique, termed as configurable, elastic crack engineering (CECE)-assisted molding, which transforms the detrimental crack effect into a powerful tool for the cost-effective, large-scale fabrication of various hierarchical structures on a wide range of materials. As an immediate implementation, the inventors develop new super-repellant surfaces and liquid diode devices with\n\n[0076] Main Text\n\n[0080] The inventors\u2019 work mainly resorts to the unique features of elastomer materials, i.e., superior elastic defor- mation and a high level of configurability. Elastomers are usually amorphous, and thus tend to randomly crack when subject to stress during the replication process. To suppress the random cracks, the inventors develop a modified soft lithography process (FIG. 1A) that enables the formation of a configurable intermediate state during the casting process. The elastomer material in such an intermediate state fulfills two requirements simultaneously. On hand, it is soft", "type": "Document"}}
