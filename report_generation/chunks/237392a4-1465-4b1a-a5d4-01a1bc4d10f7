Clearly, a significant increase in ductility has been achieved by using the compres- sion yielding mechanism. In fact, the compression yielding beam continued to take a significant load at the last point of the test curve where the test stopped due to a problem with the test rig at large displacement.\n\nBerwanger, C.

A similar response to that of Example 3 would have been obtained had the total compressive resistance of the mecha- nism been smaller than the tensile resistance of the GFRP bars. For this reason the width of the steel mechanism 2 was reduced for Example 3. This test also illustrated the cata- strophic nature of the tension failure mode. With the com- pression yielding scheme, the tensile failure can be easily avoided by ensuring the compression resistance to be smaller than the tensile resistance. The tension failure cannot always be avoided with the most common method of providing con- finement, because confinement increases not only ductility of concrete but also the strength of the concrete that increase the", "type": "Document"}}
