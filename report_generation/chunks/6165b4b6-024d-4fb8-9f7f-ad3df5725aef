This can be very useful in reducing the antenna size, particularly in wire- less communication applications. Today, compactness has become one of the topmost priorities in developing wireless communication devices and systems, supporting the devel- opment of multifunction components to miniaturize the devices and systems. As a result, there has been a trend to bundle several microwave functions into a single module, e.g. to combine several microwave resonators to provide multiple functions. It has also been shown to design a microstrip single-resonator balun-filter. Furthermore, it has recently been shown to design an antenna and filter using a single DR. Also, it has been demonstrated that the DRA can be integrated with an oscillator circuit.\n\nOne skilled in the art will derive from the following description other objects of the invention. Therefore, the fore- going statements of object are not exhaustive and serve merely to illustrate some of the many objects of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
