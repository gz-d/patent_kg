Both steel and FRP materials can be used to design and make ductile mechanism 50. There is no technical problem design and make a steel mechanism 50 and the requirement is that it should be as simple and as inexpensive as possible. Examples ofa steel mechanism 50 that has been tested in such away is shown in FIG. 2. A similar mechanism 50 made from FRP material may be used in special cases where non-mag- netic and non-corrosive material is required. The mechanism 50 can be encased into a protective material such as light weight concrete that may form a precast block 60. This pre- cast block 60 can be then cast into the beam 10 to form a ductile compression zone 40 as shown in FIG. le.\n\nwhere k, K,, and k,,, are the total, elastic and plastic curvature, respectively; L is the span of the beam; A, is the displacement due to the elastic deformation; and A, is the displacement due the plastic deformation.\n\nThe elastic deformation A, can be calculated with the con- ventional reinforced concrete theory. When plastic deforma- tion occurs, the elastic component reaches its maximum value of A,, or A.=A,. For plastic deformation, it is generally accepted in the literature that the plasticity concentrates in the plastic hinge zone that has a limited length of L, (Paulay and Priestley 1992). Therefore, k,=0 outside the plastic hinge zone. Assuming that the plastic curvature k, is constant inside the plastic hinge zone, then", "type": "Document"}}
