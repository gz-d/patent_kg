FIG. 4 is an atomic force microscope image of ReS, nanoflakes on the mica substrate, in which the ReS, nanoflakes thus formed was about 0.7 nm in thickness, indicating that the ReS, nanoflakes were indeed in a single-layer structure.\n\n1,2 Forming a Wrinkle Pattern on the Single-layer ReS, of Example 1.1\n\n[0050] The mica substrate of Example 1.1 was placed in a chamber equipped with two UV light sources. Then, the humidity in the reaction chamber was adjusted to be around 60% via use of a humidifier and inert gas (e.g., N2). Then, the mica substrate was irradiated with the two UV lights respectively set to emit UV lights of 254 nm and 185 nm, in which the energy ratio of the UV light emitting 185 nm was about 10%. The wrinkle pattern structure started to appear after irradiating for about 180 seconds (FIG. 5).\n\nUS 2022/0411965 Al\n\nExample 2: Preparation of a Sapphire Substrate Having a Wrinkle Pattern of Single-layer ReS2 Deposited Thereon\n\n[0051] In this example, a substrate having a wrinkle pat- tern of a single-layer ReS, deposited thereon was prepared in accordance with the procedures described in Example 1, except a sapphire substrate (about 1 cm? in size) was used to replace the mica substrate.
