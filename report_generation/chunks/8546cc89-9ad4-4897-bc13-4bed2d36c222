The same memory as shown in FIG. 4A may be used in FIG. 4B with a priority encoder 404, and is changed into a TCAM memory 400.\n\n[0048] Preferably, the lookup tables and the registers may be provided in a plurality of configurable logic blocks 206 in the FPGA 200, and the pairs of lookup tables and registers may further define a plurality of slices in the FPGA device 200.\n\n[0057] In this example, the address in FIG. 4A represents the search key (Sk) of TCAM memory 404 in FIG. 4B. Data_out in FIG. 4A represents the matchlines (MLs) of TCAM memory 400 in FIG. 4B. Preferably, a priority encoder 404 may be used to translate matchlines into an address where the input search key is found.\n\n[0049] For example, in some FPGA architectures, CLB 206 may consist of two types of slices; SLICEM and SLICEL. Each slice may include four lookup tables (LUTs) and eight flip-flops (also known as SRs). LUTs inside a SLICEL can be configured as a logic element which imple- ments any function up to 6-inputs (using one LUT), and may operate as function generators. LUTs inside a SLICEM can be configured as a logic element as well as a memory element, and may be used as LUTRAMs.", "type": "Document"}}
