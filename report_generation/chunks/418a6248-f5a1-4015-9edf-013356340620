It is often claimed by LED manufacturers that the LED devices have a long lifetime that could be higher than 5 years. However, the electrolytic capacitors used in the power circuit and the electronic controls for LED systems have a limited. lifetime, typically 15000 hours (or 1.7 years) at an operating temperature of 105\u00b0 C. The lifetime of an electrolytic capaci- tor is highly sensitive to the operating temperature. The life- time is doubled if the operating temperature is decreased by 10\u00b0 C. and halved if increased by 10\u00b0 C. Therefore, the short lifetime of electronic control circuits (sometimes known as ballasts) for LEDs remains one major bottleneck in the utili- zation of LED technology [Chung, H.
