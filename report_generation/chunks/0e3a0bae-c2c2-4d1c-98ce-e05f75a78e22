In this example embodiment, the illus- trated energy storage device 20' takes the form of a half coin cell. The half coin cell 20' includes a casing with a larger case 22' (e.g., the positive side) and a smaller case 24 (e.g., the negative case). The components within the casing include, assembled in the following order: an o-ring 26\u00b0 adjacent the smaller case 24', a spring 28', a spacer 30', an anode 32', a separator 34' and an electrolyte, and a cathode 36' adjacent the larger case 22 having a cast film closer to the anode 32'. The spacer 30' may be a stainless steel spacer. The cathode 36' may be a metal piece, such as a metal foil, a metal disc, etc. The spacer 30' and the anode 32' may be first coupled together before the assembly of the coin cell 20'. The separator may be placed closer to the anode than the spacer, and may be a glass fiber. The electrolyte may be a liquid, gel, or solid electrolyte, e.g., sodium bis(fluorosulfo- nylimide (NaFSD, sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (NaTFSI), or sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF,). The electrolyte may further include a solvent, e.g., diglyme or 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium \u2014 bis(trifluoromethane- sulfonyl)imide (py13TFSI). Preferably, the electrolyte has a concentration of about 0.5 M to about 4.0 M of the above\n\nmaterial in the solvent.\n\n32\n\nMar. 7, 2024\n\n[0063] The anode 32' may include the COF such as the one having the structural representation of Formula (I), a con- ductive material, a binder, and a current collector. The conductive material may include conductive carbon, such as Super P, Ketjen Black, or carbon nanotube, etc. The binder may include polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The current collector may be a copper or aluminum foil. The anode 32' is preferably centered as much as possible with the cathode 36 to avoid uneven current densities.", "type": "Document"}}
