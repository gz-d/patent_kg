In contrast, those adopting the explorative strategy (holistic style) looked more to the animal face center, suggesting engagement of global processing. These results are generally consistent with Caucasians\u2019 analytic style that is associated with focusing on the foreground object in scene perception and the eyes in face recognition, whereas Asian\u2019s holistic style is associated with looking more often at the background and the face center. However, using EMHMM, the inventors showed that Asians and Caucasians did not differ in the frequency of adopting the eyes-focused or nose-focused strategy, suggesting little modulation from culture on eye movement pattern when individual difference was taken into account (Chuk et al. 2017).", "type": "Document"}}
