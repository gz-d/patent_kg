The experiments performed includes measuring reflection coefficient using an Agilent\u2122 8753ES vector network analyzer, and measuring radiation pattern, antenna gain, and antenna efficiency using a Satimo\u2122 StarLab System.\n\nFigure 5 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the filter-antenna 400 and reflection coefficient of a reference antenna. As shown in Figure 5, the measured result generally agrees with the simulated result. The measured reflection coefficient 1s below -10 dB over the entire frequency range (5 \u4e00 6.5 GHz). This demonstrates the reflection-less characteristic of the filter-antenna 400. It is noted that the reflection coefficient of the filter-antenna 400 does not have a sharp selectivity. For comparison, a conventional rectangular patch antenna having the same length of La and width of W; is included here as the reference antenna. Its simulated reflection coefficient is also shown in Figure 5. It can be seen from Figure 5 that the impedance bandwidth of the reference antenna is much narrower than that of the filter-antenna 400 although the reference antenna and filter-antenna 400 have the same patch size.\n\nGHz.\n\nFigures 6A and 6B show the measured and simulated normalized radiation patterns at As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, the maximum co-polar field is found in the boresight\n\n5.8\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n9", "type": "Document"}}
