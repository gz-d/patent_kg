The most widely used assays are in vitro assays in which new drugs are tested in endothelial cells cultured in plastic flasks. The drawback is that it is difficult to extrapolate the observation made in an in vitro assay to model the com- plex process of angiogenesis actually occurring in in vivo situations (Staton et al., 2004; Taraboletti and Giavazzi, 2004). On the other hand, in vivo assays using animal models, for example mice, are costly, time-consuming and difficult for quantification (Staton et al., 2004). Thus, multiple in vitro assays are commonly employed for the identification of lead. compounds. The efficacy of lead compounds on angiogenesis are subsequently validated by more than one in vivo assay. However, quantification is still an important key parameter for angiogenesis assays. Criteria for an ideal quantitative angiogenesis assay (Hasan et al., 2004) are that the assay\n\ncapable of inducing alteration in the vasculature pattern in teleosts. In this tier, embryos are treated by agents in wide range of concentration, covering 7 orders of magnitude. To visualize blood vessels in transparent embryos, color staining is applied to detect endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity predominantly in vascular endothelial cells. The pattern of intersegmental vessels is chosen as the target to be examined because the pattern is regular and the variation between indi- vidual is very little, making the interpretation of angiogenic effect much easier. The preferred stage of embryos to be examined is at least 72 hour-post fertilization (hpf). Any alteration in the pattern of intersegmental vessels in any con- centration of the agent will conclude as the angiogenic modu-\n\n1) provide quantitative measure of structure of newly formed blood vessels;", "type": "Document"}}
