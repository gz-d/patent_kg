The antenna device of claim 8, wherein the first the second lens are spaced apart along an axis, and aligned co-axially.\n\nand\n\n10. The antenna device of claim 9, wherein the movement mechanism is arranged to rotate the first lens relative to the second lens about the axis, by rotating either one or both of the first and second lens about the axis, clockwise or counterclockwise, to steer the output signal radially and azimuthally on a focal plane; and wherein the movement mechanism is arranged to translate the first lens relative to the second lens along the axis, by translating either one or both of the first and second lens along the axis, towards or away from each other, to move the output signal longitudi- nally.\n\n11. The antenna device of claim 10, wherein the move- ment mechanism is arranged to simultaneously rotate the first lens relative to the second lens and to translate the first lens relative to the second lens.\n\nlens\n\nare\n\nDec. 9, 2021\n\n12.
