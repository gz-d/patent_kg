This feature greatly reduces non- specific background noise. However, the target RNA needs to be artificially fused with the BoxB stem-loop close to the RBP binding region, and it needs to be expressed ectopically in the cell. Therefore, RaPID must compromise on three important factors: firstly, the abundance of ectopically expressed target RNA greatly exceeds the endogenous level of the transcript, resulting in a non-physiological balance of the interaction between RNA and RBP; secondly, the incor- poration of the hairpin structure BoxB into the target RNA may interfere with the natural structure of the transcript, thereby changing its binding protein; thirdly, BASU can only label the RBP adjacent to the stem loop of BoxB at the 5' or 3' end of the RNA, therefore, some important RBPs may be missed, especially for long transcripts such as XIST (~19 kb). Briefly, the potential shortcomings, including the loss of cellular background, extensive molecular engineer- ing and possible destruction of the natural structure of RNA, greatly limit the wide application of this method.\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n[0008] An object of the present invention is to provide novel method for determining long non-coding ribonucleic acid (IncRNA) interaction proteins.\n\n[0009] \u2018The present invention provides a CRISPR-Assisted RNA-Protein Interaction Detection (CARPID) method, which integrates CRISPR/CasRx based RNA targeting and roximity markers to identify binding proteins of specific IncRNAs within cells at natural state.", "type": "Document"}}
