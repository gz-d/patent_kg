Problematically, as the terahertz frequency band usually lies beyond the maximum oscillation frequency in silicon, these existing devices may suffer from heating and/or efficiency problems.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0005] In a first aspect, there is provided a radiator for terahertz electromagnetic radiation. The radiator comprises one or more radiator units. Each of the one or more radiator units respectively comprises: an oscillator arrangement operable to generate third harmonic power, and a patch antenna arrangement operably coupled with the oscillator arrangement for radiating terahertz electromagnetic radia- tion based on the generated third harmonic power.\n\n[0006] The terahertz electromagnetic radiation provided by the radiator may be in the range from about 0.1 THz to about 10 THz. In some embodiments, the terahertz electro- magnetic radiation is from about 0.2 THz to about 5 THz. In some embodiments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.3 THz to about 3 THz. In some embodi- ments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.3 THz to about 1 THz. In some embodiments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.4 THz to about 0.8 THz. In some embodiments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.4 THz to about 0.7 THz. In some embodiments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.6 THz to about 0.7 THz. In some embodi- ments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation is from about 0.64 THz to about 0.69 THz.", "type": "Document"}}
