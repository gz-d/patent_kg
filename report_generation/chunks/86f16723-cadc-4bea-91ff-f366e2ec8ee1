The two scanning directions are considered to be substan- tially orthogonal when the angle between the first second scanning directions are between 85 degrees to degrees, preferably between 89 degrees to 91 degrees, more preferably about 90 degrees.\n\nand\n\n95\n\n[0036] The method 200 includes, in step 202, determining the first scanning direction and the second scanning direc- tion. In one example, in step 202, determining the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction includes analyzing an image of the specimen produced by the imaging apparatus, and/or determining extent of orthogonality of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction.\n\nan\n\nApr. 15 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0110990 A1\n\n4\n\nsystem may be installed in the information handling system\n\n[ 0041 ] Accordingly , the required ( ideal ) drive signal\n\namplitudes A and B in the orthogonal scanning directions\n\n300 , e.g. , on the disk drive 312 or in the memory unit 304 .\n\ncan be described by this set of equations :\n\nThe memory unit 304 and the disk drive 312 may be\n\noperated by the processor 302.
