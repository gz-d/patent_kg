This\n\nthe Mn element in the electrodeposited MnO , has a charge\n\nresult may reveal that the elastomer coating retards the mass\n\nstate of approximate 4.0 ( FIG . 13B ) . The SEM images\n\nexchange between the inner organohydrogel matrix with the\n\nintuitively showed that the MnO2 comprises a highly porous\n\nouter environment . In other words , the coating may have\n\nstructure of interconnected nanoflakes ( FIG . 13C ) .
