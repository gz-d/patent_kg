Good deformability of materials may come together with the high tendency to creep that will result in significant long-term deflections. In such a case, an additional elastic compression component, such as additional normal concrete 15 (see FIG. 1c) or additional compression bars or plates 17 (see FIG. 1d) can be used in the plastic hinge 20 on top of the compression zone 40 to provide sufficient elasticity and rigid- ity at service loads. The additional elastic compression com- ponent will give up at ultimate load (by crushing of the top concrete 15 in case of FIG. 1c or by buckling of the bars or\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates the test setup used in the Examples.\n\nFIG. 6a shows a graph of the load vs. mid-span displace- ments of the flexural members tested in the Examples, while FIG. 66 illustrates the setup in Example 3 after the test had concluded.\n\nFIG. 7 is a graph depicting the parameters of the definition of ductility in the context of this invention.\n\nFIG. 8 is a graph showing the measured plastic hinge deformation in Example 3, with the elongation of the bar showing the tensile deformation of reinforcement bars, and compression shortening of the mechanism showing the com- pression deformation, within the plastic hinge zone.\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nsuch\n\nas\n\nthe\n\nof\n\nby drawings,\n\ntions\n\na\n\nFIG. results\n\ntest\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nof the the\n\n1)A\n\nFIG,\n\nReferring to FIGS. 1a-1d, one means of achieving com-\n\nplate 17 in case of FIG. 1d) and pass the compression load to\n\nUS 8,656,685 B2\n\n6\n\n5\n\nthe compressible material 30 so that sufficient ductility can be\n\nties would be important for members with both tension and\n\ncompression yielding.
