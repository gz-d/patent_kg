The filter-antenna 1s compact, low-profile, and small, and ls suitable for miniature communication devices and systems. The above embodiments of the invention can be used ln the wireless transmitter to reduce the system size and loss. The filter-antenna in the above embodiment has four radiation nulls that can be tuned independently to facilitate the design. A resistor-terminated band-stop filter 1s embedded at the center of the patch antenna to absorb the energy in the stopbands. The band-stop filter consists of a defected ground structure, a defected microstrip structure, along with the chip resistor. is achieved in the and in the\n\nGood impedance matching\n\npassband\n\nstopband.\n\nThe filter-antenna in the above embodiments may reduce, avoid, or prevent the energy in the stopband from reflecting back to the source or other components, by absorbing or dissipating the energy through a filter (esp., resistor). The energy in the passband is transmitted to the antenna, whereas the energy ln the stopbands 1s absorbed by the filter (esp., resistor). As a result, the energy reflection is greatly reduced or even eliminated in both the passband and stopbands, which avoid possible detrimental effects on the source or other components.\n\nIt will be appreciated by person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the invention should therefore be considered in all respects as illustrative, not restrictive.\n\nFor example, the filter-antenna need not be a patch antenna but can be other forms of", "type": "Document"}}
