As shown in FIG. 7, it can be seen that the nanosheet broke up into tiny fragments after annealing at 300\u00b0 C. or 500\u00b0 C. for 2 hours, and was subsequently transformed into nanoparticles after annealing for 10 hours. The general trend is that the longer is the annealing time, the larger is the formed nanoparticle. In the present invention, it also noted that the particle size grew at the expense of their number density ((e), (f) in the FIG. 7), which is similar to a typical Ostwald ripening process. Based on the above results, it is clear that the formation of the nanoparticles is thermodynamically favored after the Au\u2014C\n\nnanosheet is decomposed upon heating.\n\n[0077] Referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B, a glassy carbon electrode coated with metal-carbon nanoparticles 1s pro- vided by isothermal annealing of organic-gold membranes. FIG. 8A shows a photography of the glassy carbon electrode coated with organic-gold membrane and metal-carbon com- posite nanoparticles, and its optical microscope image 1s shown in FIG. 8B.\n\nExamples\n\n[0078] The examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are included within the spirit and purview of this application.
