They demonstrate the Na storage performance of the BHT-BQ-COF-based electrode in SIBs with a high reversible capacity of about 350 mAh gr at a current density of 20 mA g\u2122', indicating the abundant redox active sites of BHT-BQ-COF.\n\n[0079] Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed on a MACCOR battery cycler at current densities of 100, 200, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 and 5000 mA g!. FIGS. 7A and 7B show the high cycling stability with reversible capacities of 290 mAh g -1 and 282 mAh g latthe current densities of 200 mA g~! and 400 mA gr respectively, which is associated with the stable struc- ture of BHT-BQ-COF. FIG. 8 shows the superior rate capability of the BHT-BQ-COF-based electrode at a wide current density range of 100 mA g\u2122! to 5000 mA g\u2122! with a voltage range of 0.1 V to 3.5 V, showing the fast Na* diffusion kinetics of the electrode.\n\n[0080] FIG. 9 show the electrochemical impedance spec- troscopy (EIS) curves of the cell of Na//BHT-BQ-COF- based electrode at different charge and discharge states with a wide frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. Elec- trochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was obtained by applying a sine wave with an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz on Solartron 1400 electrochemical workstation. As shown in FIG. 9, the charge-transfer resistance (R.,) corresponds to the semi- circle at high frequencies. The small R,, in the cell of Na//BHT-BQ-COF remains constant after the charge and discharge processes, which manifests fast reaction kinetics, specifically Na* diffusion kinetics, on the electrode surface and enables excellent rate performance of BHT-BQ-COF- based electrodes.\n\nExample 7\n\nFabrication of BHT-BQ-COF-Based Anode and Presodiated BHT-BQ-COF-Based Anode", "type": "Document"}}
