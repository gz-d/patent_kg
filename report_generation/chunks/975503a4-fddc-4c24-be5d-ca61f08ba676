The dielectric resonator antenna of claim 1, wherein the first resonant mode is transverse magnetic (TM) mode.\n\n3. The dielectric resonator antenna of claim 1, wherein the second resonant mode is transverse electric (TE) mode.\n\n4. The dielectric resonator antenna of claim 1, wherein resonant mode is transverse magnetic (TM) mode second resonant mode is transverse electric (TE) mode.\n\n5. The dielectric resonator antenna of claim 1, wherein substrate assembly comprises a first substrate layer and second substrate layer, and wherein the first substrate layer arranged between the dielectric resonator element and second substrate layer.\n\n6. The dielectric resonator antenna of claim 5, wherein feeding network is arranged between the first substrate the dielectric resonator element.\n\n[0053] Multiple such dielectric resonator antennas of the invention can be integrated to form a MIMO antenna. The dielectric resonator antenna and/or the MIMO antenna of the invention can be integrated or otherwise used in a commu- nication device.\n\n7. dielectric resonator antenna of claim 6, wherein substrate assembly further comprises a ground plane arranged between the first and second substrate layers and. being operably connected with the feeding network.\n\n[0054] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the inven- tion should therefore be considered in all respects as illus- trative, not restrictive.", "type": "Document"}}
