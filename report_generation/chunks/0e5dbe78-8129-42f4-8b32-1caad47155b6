For example, using the EMHMM method of the instant invention, a perception style can be assigned to an individual based on the eye movements of the individual measured and evaluated using the EMHMM of the invention. Specific eye movement patterns measured with the EMHMM of the invention are associated with an analytic style of perception while other eye movement patterns are associated with a holistic style of perception. Furthermore, an analytic perception style is associated with improved recognition performance while a holistic perception style is associated with a cognitive decline in executive function and visual attention. Therefore, the methods of the instant invention can be used to detect cognitive performance or the decline thereof in an individual based on the individual\u2019s eye movement patterns. Importantly, the methods of the invention allow such cognitive performance assessment without the need for determining additional physiological parameters. Therefore, the methods of the invention are suitable for applications where detection of eye movement is the only data available such as in driver\n\nassessment and/or eye movement assessment via any computer or electronic device screen.\n\nIn some embodiments, the EMHMM with co-clustering of the instant invention is used to assess individuals that share similar eye movement patterns across stimuli.
