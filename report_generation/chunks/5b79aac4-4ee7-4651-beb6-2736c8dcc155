The focused optical beam is reflected on an optical/acoustic beam combiner, transmits through a plano-concave lens (45-697, Edmund optics), then illumi- nates the sample S. Induced ultrasonic waves (photoacoustic signals generated by the sample in response to the laser pulses) are collimated by the plano-concave lens, transmits through the optical/acoustic beam combiner, and detected by a 50-MHz broadband piezoelectric transducer (V214-BC- RM, Olympus). The focused optical beam is coaxially and. confocally aligned with the focused ultrasonic detection beam to optimize the detection sensitivity.\n\nAt each\n\nlaser\n\nthe laser\n\n[0085] pump pulse, apparatus generates three temporally separated laser pulses at 532 nm, 545 nm, and 558 nm, and the system 200 sequentially acquires three depth-resolved A-lines at the three wave- lengths. Volumetric photoacoustic images are acquired by raster scanning the photoacoustic probe in the lateral plane. The lateral resolution is 3.4 um. The time to acquire one set of three-wavelength photoacoustic signals is ~500 ns. If the mechanical scanning or blood flow speed is less than 1 cm/s, the misalignment among the three A-lines would be smaller than 5 nm, which is negligible compared with the lateral resolution. Other details of the system 200 including the amplifier (\u201cAmp\u201d), the data acquisition module (\u201c\u201cDAQ\u201d), and the processor (\u201cPC\u201d) are omitted for simplicity. Briefly, the amplifier is arranged to amplify the received photoa- coustic signals; the data acquisition module is arranged to\n\nregulate the received amplified photoacoustic signals; and\n\n300\n\nJan. 13, 2022", "type": "Document"}}
