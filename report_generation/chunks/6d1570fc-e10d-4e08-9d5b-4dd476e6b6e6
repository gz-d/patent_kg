Power adaptors (or AC-DC power converters) are traditionally used to charge the batteries in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic prod- ucts, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable electronic equipment.", "type": "Document"}}
