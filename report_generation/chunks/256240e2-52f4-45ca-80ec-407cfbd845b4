As shown in the FIG. 12, for the PTFE film without loaded charges, the maximum spreading area As is mea- sured at 2.71 cm*, which is comparable with the A,,.. measured in the case of the PTFE with the loaded charges (2.72 cm?). This result suggests that the maximum spreading area is insensitive to the surface charges on PTFE film.\n\ninvention, which are, for clarity, described in the content of separate embodiments, may be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the content of a single embodiment, may be provided separately or in any appropriate sub-combinations. It is to be noted that certain features of the embodiments are illustrated by way of non-limiting examples. It is also to be noted that certain features in connection with the invention are not explained. in great detail for brevity reason. However, such features are readily understood by a skilled person in the art. For example, a skilled person would understand that the auto- mation of the system can be achieved by linked different components in the systems.
