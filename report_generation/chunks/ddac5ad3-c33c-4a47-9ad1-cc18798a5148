Each sub-metasurface, loaded with an indepen- dent STC film, generates one specific modulated waveform, corresponding to one communication channel. In one example, the lattice of meta-atoms in the sub-metasurface is 0.314,(where 1, is the free-space wavelength at 23.5 GHz). The sub-metasurface is free of higher-order diffractions in the free space (FIG. 21). The resultant universal metasurface antenna 400 can be considered as a combination of the two interwoven sub-metasurfaces, which share the same radiat- ing aperture above the waveguide to generate two indepen- dent modulated channels. In one example, two different time gradients are applied to the two sub-metasurfaces, and the equivalent momentums imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation push the m=\u20141 and m=\u20142 harmonic frequencies to radiate into the free space with output angles of \u201430\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 for the two sub-metasurfaces, respectively.
