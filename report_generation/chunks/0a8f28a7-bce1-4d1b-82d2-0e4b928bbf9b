When the droplet fully detaches from the drain electrode at fof=715./ ms, both the current and measured charge drop to zero, reversing to the switching-off state again. In this condition, all the charges are restored back to source, making it possible to restart a new cycle. As shown in Fig. 3c, such a reversibility is further confirmed by the cyclic charge measurement. Notably, the amount of charge transferred between the source and drain in each cycle is constant, suggesting that there Is no additional charge supply from PTFE or water In", "type": "Document"}}
