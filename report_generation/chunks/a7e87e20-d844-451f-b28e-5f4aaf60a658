The power contro] circuit of the charging pad consists of two power conversion stages. Depending on the nature of the input power supply, the first power stage is an AC-DC power converter with variable output voltage control and a second stage is a DC-AC power inverter with constant current control. The combination ofthe two stages provides power control of the charging pad and generates AC magnetic flux of ideally constant magnitude over the charging areas within a group of primary windings that excited.\n\n(51) Int.
