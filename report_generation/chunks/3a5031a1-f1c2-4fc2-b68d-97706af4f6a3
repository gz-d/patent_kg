The broad- band linear polarizer 511 is adjusted to recombine the p- and s-polarized beams from the SPR sensing unit so as to generate spectral interferograms. The prober 512 is configured to obtain the interference spectrum of the recombined light beam.\n\nwhere ,,.ic-48 the time delay introduced by the liquid crystal variable retarder 221. Therefore, each pixel on the spectral CCD array of the prober 512 contains its own oscillation in the time domain. The SPR phase information is however preserved so that the differential phase can be extracted along the temporal dimension. Therefore, the higher the number of temporal cycle, the better is the accuracy of SPR phase extrac- tion. FIGS. 7b and 7c shows the addition of the electronic controlled liquid crystal variable retarder implemented according to an embodiment.\n\nThe prober 512 may contain a single channel spectral ana- lyzer 513 which may comprise a dispersive grating for sepa- rating a light beam into spatially dispersed wavelengths; and a detector array 514 have a plurality of pixels, each pixel for measuring an intensity oscillation signal for a wavelength of the dispersed wavelengths. The detector array 514 may be a linear charge-coupled device (CCD) detector array used to capture the spectral intensity oscillation of the recombined p- and s-polarized beams. The signal trace from the entire opti- cal detector array 514 contains all the information required for computing the spectral phase change and spectral inten- sity dip due to energy transformation associated with the SPR effect at all incident wavelengths at fixed angles.", "type": "Document"}}
