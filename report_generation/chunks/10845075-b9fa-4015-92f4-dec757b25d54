In an aspect, the SDGD component 2122 can include capacitor C,, that can be used to supply a desired positive voltage signal for the invert- ing inputs of the comparators CP, (as shown in FIG. 21), CP, (as shown if FIGS. 21 and 26), and CP, (as shown in FIG. 22), which can provide a desired safe margin that can be set based. at least in part by the potential divider, comprising the resis- tors Ra and Rss, wherein diode D, can be employed for use with capacitor C,, and resistors Rs and R,;, and wherein capacitor C,, can be employed for use with comparator CP, and resistors R34 and Ras. The output of comparator CP, can be provided to transistors Q,, and Q,;, which can be associ- ated with resistor Ra to facilitate controlling switching of switch 2110. In another aspect, the voltage of capacitor Cis\uff0c which can be stabilized by the zener diode Dz,, can be the power supply for the comparators CP,, CP,, and CP, wherein resistor Rss can be employed for use with capacitor C,,; as well as other associated components, as shown in FIG. 21. The capacitor Cis will be charged up to the designated voltage before the voltage of capacitor Cis increases to reach voltage high enough for the comparators CP,, CP,, and CP, to operate. This arrangement of the SDGD subsystem, includ- ing SDGD component 2122, can ensure that the low-side switches, switch 2108 (M,), switch 2110 (Ms), and switch 2112 (M,), to be switched only when the SDGD subsystem has completed the start-up phase and reaches", "type": "Document"}}
