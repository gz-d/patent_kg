In imaging applications, a radiated beam focused in a target area can reduce undesired interference from neighboring structures and increase the system dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio. A steering focus beam enables fast imaging. The novel antenna includes at least two discrete dielectric lenses fed by a stationary horn source. In-plane synchronous counter- rotation and co-rotation of the lens pair steers its near-field focus radially and azimuthally, respectively, while linear translation between the upper and lower lens moves the focal point longitudinally. One implementation of the inven- tion is based on thin discrete dielectric lenses, making the system more compact, lightweight, and able to be integrated with gigahertz and terahertz sources with improved system performance compared to conventional refractive lens-based devices. In one implementation, the lens antenna of the present invention can realize 3D near-field focusing with a large field of view of 80\u00b0x80\u00b0.\n\n[0028] In one aspect, the dielectric lenses of the present invention use metasurfaces; the resultant structure is termed \u201cmetalens.\u201d Metasurfaces, governed by the generalized Snell\u2019s laws of reflection and refraction, are arrays of subwavelength phase-gradient scatterers imposing phase discontinuities at the interface of two media to control light wavefronts. Metalenses are capable of focusing light in a planar form. As used herein, the term \u201cmetalens\u201d relates to an engineered three-dimensional material lens with arrays of subwavelength elements.", "type": "Document"}}
