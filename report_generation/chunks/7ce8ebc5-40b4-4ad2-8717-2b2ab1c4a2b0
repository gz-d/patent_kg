In particular, the anode may be a conductive polymer of polypyrrole (PPy) elec- trodeposited on a SS CNT paper. Alternatively, the PPy may be electrodeposited on carbon cloth carbon paper, nickel/ copper alloy cloth, steel sheet, and the like. The electrode- position may be carried out in an electrochemical setup containing a solution of 0.1 M p-toluenesulfonic acid (AR, Aladdin), 0.3 M sodium toluenesulfate (AR, Sigma-Al- drich), and 0.5% pyrrole monomer (AR, Sigma-Aldrich). The electrodeposition may be performed at a predetermined voltage (e.g. 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl) for a predetermined time (e.g. 10 min) at 0\u00b0 C.\n\n[0180] The ionic bonds may act as a reversible crosslink- ing point that can dynamically break/rupture and reform/ restore to dissipate mechanical energy upon subjecting to external mechanical loads. The rapid reformation or resto- ration of the ruptured bonds may further minimize the structural expansion of the electrolyte when it is operated under water.\n\n[0181] The polymeric layer comprises a plurality of PDMS chains 218. The PDMS chains may directly form one or more covalent bond between the silane molecules of adjacent PDMS chains, forming a chemically crosslinked structure. The PDMS chains may also intertwine and inter- cross with each other to form a physically crosslinked network.", "type": "Document"}}
