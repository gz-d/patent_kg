This summary is not an extensive overview of\n\nthe the the\n\nJan. 11, 2024\n\ndisclosure and it does not identify key/critical elements of the present invention or delineate the scope of the present invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\n\n[0008] As embodied and broadly described herein, the purpose of the present disclosure is to provide a solder alloy composition comprising a plurality of solder particles of a Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base alloy, and a method for producing the solder particles. Each solder particle is characterized in having a diameter less than 10 jim, such that the bonding between substrates and solder particles can be improved.\n\n[0009] In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a solder alloy composition comprising a plurality of solder particles of a Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy, in which each solder particles is less than 10 hm in diameter, and the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy comprises 12-22% of Sn, 33-43% of Bi and 45-55% of In by weight.\n\n[0010] According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, each solder particles is about 0.1 to 3 um diameter.\n\nin\n\n[0011] According to some other embodiments of the pres- disclosure, each solder particles is about 1 to 6 hm diameter.\n\nent\n\nin\n\n[0012] According to some alternative embodiments of present disclosure, the Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base alloy further com- prises an element selected from the group consisting of Pb, and Ag.\n\nZn,\n\nthe", "type": "Document"}}
