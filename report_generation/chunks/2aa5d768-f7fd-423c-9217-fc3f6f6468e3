The abundant microphores\n\nmould and an AD - gel electrolyte was obtained after the\n\nwithin the polymer matrix provides a large amount of\n\nphoto - induced free radical polymerization . After that , the\n\nchannels for zinc ion transportation , rendering highly ionic\n\nelastomeric coating process of the as - prepared battery was\n\nconductivity of the AD - gel even under a low temperature .\n\nperformed by dipping the battery into a silane precursor\n\nsolution for five times , followed by drying the battery in an\n\n[ 0220 ] The Ad - gel also possessed a higher value of ionic\n\noven . In addition , pure PAM - hydrogel electrolyte based\n\nconductivity ( 18.2 mS cm\n\n) at 80 \u00b0 C. as a result of increase\n\nZn - MnO2 battery ( PAM - battery ) was also fabricated as the\n\nin diffusion velocity of zinc ions at high temperature .\n\ncontrol group .\n\nFurthermore , no appreciable deterioration in the ionic con\n\nductivity was observed after 30 d of long - term storage in air\n\n[ 0226 ] The electrochemical performance of the fabricated\n\n( FIG . 12A ) . The stable electrochemical performance of the\n\nAD - battery 1400 under normal condition ( 25 \u00b0 C. ) was\n\ninvestigated . As shown in FIG . 15A , the CV curves of Zn\n\nAD - gel under the aforesaid conditions was also observed in\n\nthe AC impedance spectra as shown in FIG . 12C . All these\n\nanode revealed that the plating / stripping of the deposited\n\nresults confirm the extremely temperature tolerance and\n\nzinc is stable with nearly overlapped curves . For the depos\n\nanti - dehydration function of AD - gel electrolyte for long\n\nited MnO2 cathode , it is observed that two distinguishable\n\nterm application .\n\nredox peaks occur in the discharge / charge process and the\n\nCVs remained invariable after several cycles , demonstrating\n\n[ 0221 ]\n\nPreferably , a rechargeable Zn - MnO2 battery con\n\na good reversibility of the cathode .\n\ntaining the aforesaid AD - gel may be fabricated in accor", "type": "Document"}}
