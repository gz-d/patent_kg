For example, each basic D-CAM block implements 48 bytes of TCAM with configuration as 64x6, where 64 is the depth (D) of TCAM and 6 is the width (W) of TCAM. As discussed earlier, the size of the TCAM may be expanded or scaled, in which the basic memory blocks may include multiple blocks connected in a parallel form to increase the width of the TCAM structure, or in a cascade form to increase the depth of the TCAM structure.\n\n[0050] Preferably, each LUTRAM may be a column memory of N cells which can be used as N-bit RAM. Multiple LUTRAMs combine to form a distributed RAM structure in a memory element. In one example, N=64 and therefore the LUTRAM may be a 64-bit RAM. Alterna- tively, N may be of other value in different memory struc- tures.\n\n[0059] With reference to FIG. 5A, increasing the width TCAM from 6 bits to 12 bits requires an additional D-CAM block by keeping the depth of TCAM constant. Alterna- tively, referring to FIG. 5B, increasing the depth of TCAM\n\n[0051] With reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, a 3-input LUTRAM saves the information of 1x3 TCAM.
