The specified number of barrier pat- tern modes can include, for example, a first barrier pattern mode 216, a second barrier pattern mode 218, and a third arrier pattern mode 220, wherein the first barrier pattern mode 216 can be associated with a transparent barrier pattern that can pass through video content (e.g., 2-D content) with- out affecting or altering the video content, the second barrier pattern mode 218 can be associated with a stereoscopic-type barrier pattern that can process input video content (e.g.\uff0c enhanced 2-D video content comprising stereoscopic images) to generate a specified number (e.g., 2) of 3-D stereoscopic images of a 3-D image scene as an output, as more fully disclosed herein, and the third barrier pattern mode 220 can e associated with an autostereoscopic-type barrier pattern that can process input video content (e.g., enhanced 2-D video content comprising autostereoscopic images) to gener- ate a specified number of 3-D autostereoscopic images of a 3-D image scene as an output, as more fully disclosed herein.\n\nThe control region (e.g., 112) can be or can comprise a light producing means or light emitting means that can transmit or output optical signals comprising light, which can be in the visible range of humans or can be outside the visible range of humans. The control region can produce and present different optical signals comprising different light patterns to facilitate selection of a barrier pattern mode (e.g., transparent mode, a first-type of partially opaque mode, a second-type of partially opaque mode, etc.) to use to process video content, based at least in part on the type of video content being presented by the projector screen component 202.", "type": "Document"}}
