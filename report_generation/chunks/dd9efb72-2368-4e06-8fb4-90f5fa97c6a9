The grouping process 406 is arranged to separate the operation data into a source domain set and a target domain set. The source domain set may comprise of a portion of the opera- tion information from a plurality of wind turbines and thus form a common training set that would train a learning network with operation information that is shared amongst a plurality of wind turbines. This is advantageous as a lurality of wind turbines are likely to collectively provide a much larger data set for training, although the disadvan- tage is that such a training set would be for wind turbines generally, and not specific to an individual turbines.\n\n[0071] With reference to FIG. 4, there is illustrated another example of a method for monitoring a device. This method will be described with reference to FIGS. 4 to 9 and will refer to the usage of the method for monitoring wind turbines, although as it would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, any other devices, plant, equipment or apparatus may also be monitored.\n\n[0072] As shown, this method includes the process o: training the plurality of learning networks, which once trained, may no longer be necessary to operate the method for monitoring the devices. However, periodic or on-going training may increase further knowledge within the machine learning structure of the system and method for monitoring devices and therefore increasing the accuracy of the method in operation.", "type": "Document"}}
