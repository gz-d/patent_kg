The control signal is arranged to control the deflector based on A and B. These predeter- mined equations can be applied when \u4e2d is smaller than 45 degrees, when \u4e2d is smaller than 30 degrees, when \u4e2d is smaller than 15 degrees, or when \u4e2d is smaller than 10 when is smaller than 5\n\n[0014] In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for controlling a deflector in an imaging apparatus. The imaging apparatus comprises an electron gun arranged to provide electron beam to scan a specimen, and the deflector. The deflector is arranged to move the electron beam in a first scanning direction and a second scanning direction that are in the same plane for scanning the specimen. The method includes: determining the first scanning direction and the second scanning direc- tion, and processing the determined first scanning direction and the determined second scanning direction based on predetermined equations. The method also includes provid- ing, based on the processing, a control signal to the deflector to adjust one or both of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction such that (i) the first scanning direction and the second adjusted scanning direction are within a required orthogonality limit or (ii) the first adjusted scanning direction and the second adjusted scanning direc-\n\n[0021] The imaging apparatus may be an electron micro- scope (e.g., a scanning electron microscope) or an inspection apparatus for inspecting objects (such as semiconductors).\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
