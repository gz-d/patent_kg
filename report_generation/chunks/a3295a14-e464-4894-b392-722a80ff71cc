The inductive parameters of the transformers with and without ferrite shields are shown in Table II. However his shortcoming of the coreless PCB transformer can be overcome by connecting a resonant capacitor across the secondary of the transformer. The energy efficiency of the 4 PCB transformers with 10082//1000 pF capacitive load is shown in FIG. 18.
