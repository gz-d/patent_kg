Only a single electromagnetic device is energized. The abscissa refers to actuation current or energizing current that energizes the electromagnetic device. Curves 902a and 904a refer to magnetic flux density and magnetic field gradient respectively under different actuation current with- out magnetic bridge. Curves 9026 and 9046 refer to mag- netic flux density and magnetic field gradient respectively under different actuation current with magnetic bridge, where the magnetic bridge has a configuration similar to that with reference to FIGS. 4A-4B. The length l is 636 mm, and the width t is 160 mm. The geometric parameters for the magnetic core are same as those optimized values as described above with reference to FIG. 8.\n\n[0086] As shown for curves 902a and 904a, under current of 20 A and absent magnetic bridge, the magnetic flux density actuated is around 68.8 mT and the magnetic field gradient is around 4 T/m. When a magnetic bridge is included, the magnetic flux density and gradient increase to around 93 mT and 5.3 T/m respectively. The magnetic bridge provides a lower magnetic resistance when compared to air. It provides a circuit or path for field flux line to travel from coil to coil. As further shown, the soft iron core becomes saturated at around 6 A. Despite the approximate linearity of the magnetic flux density and gradient, connect- ing two electromagnetic devices (or more specifically, con- necting two magnetic cores) with a magnetic bridge can increase magnetic flux density generation by around 35%, and increase magnetic gradient performance by around 32.5%.", "type": "Document"}}
