Such a process is essentially the conventional contact\n\nthe action of gate voltage in the case of FET . The dynamic\n\nelectrification in which the charge generation is limited by\n\nformation of the gate - like channel in our TIDE - G is also\n\naccompanied by the concurrent building of electrical double\n\nan interfacial effect . Then the current exhibits a large accel\n\nlayers ( EDLs ) at both terminals that ultimately leads to the\n\neration with a pronounced peak up to 410.1 uA at ton = 0 ms ,\n\ntransiting into a switching - on state . More interesting char\n\npreferential charge separation and the directional transport\n\nacterization can be obtained by careful synchronization of\n\nof ions to the respective terminals . From the energy point of\n\ndroplet spreading dynamics and current response as well as\n\nview , continuous impinging droplets also serve as soft ,\n\nmapping the time - dependent variation of charges flowing\n\nconfigurable transformers that dynamically regulate the effi\n\ncient hydrodynamic - to - electrical energy conversion .
