The electromagnetic device comprises an elongated sleeve defining a hollow space and having an external surface, a magnetic core, and an electric coil wounded onto the external surface of the elongated sleeve and configured to generate the magnetic field when energized. The magnetic core has a first end, a second end, and a middle portion that is disposed between the first end and the second end and received in the hollow space. The first end is provided with a core tip that is shaped substan- tially as a cone and has a cone radius greater than zero.\n\n[0005] According to another aspect of the embodiments, it is provided with an electromagnetic actuation system for generating a gradient-enhanced magnetic field in a work- space. The system includes one or more pairs of electro- magnetic devices. Each electromagnetic device includes an elongated sleeve that defines a hollow space and has an external surface, an electric coil wounded onto the external surface of the elongated sleeve, a magnetic core, and actua- tion means for actuating a relative movement between the magnetic core and the elongated sleeve. The magnetic core has a first end, a second end, and a middle portion that is disposed between the first end and the second end and\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nreceived in the hollow space. The second end is coupled to the actuation means. The electromagnetic devices are con- figured to be activated such that the gradient-enhanced magnetic field is generated in the workspace. The relative movement between the magnetic core and the elongated. sleeve for one or more of the electromagnetic devices modifies the workspace.", "type": "Document"}}
