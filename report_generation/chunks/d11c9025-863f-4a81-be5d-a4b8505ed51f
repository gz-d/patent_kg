Additionally or alternatively, the locking and unlocking processes can be controlled in various manners, such as manually or remotely. [0057] Additionally or alternatively, the restraining el- ement 60 can be in the form of one or more blocking elements 64 for restraining the movement of the support members 10, 10a, and 10b, such as shown in Figs. 7a and 7b. In an exemplary embodiment, the blocking ele- ments 64 can be placed on the securing elements 20. In another exemplary embodiment, the blocking elements 64 can be placed on the corresponding upper and lower vertebrae 6 and 8 of instrumented spine 2. Exemplary blocking elements 64 can include, but are not limited to, screws, screws with washers, or similar devices. [0058] In one exemplary embodiment, when the su- perelastic support member 10 restores to its original po- sition after being implanted, the blocking elements 64 can act as a stop mechanism to intercept the movement of the support member 10. The blocking elements 64 can instantaneously stop the movement of the support mem- ber 10 without any manual or remote control means. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the re- straining elements 60 are also within the scope of the present invention. [0059] It will be appreciated that the various features described herein may be used singly or in any combina- tion thereof. Therefore, the present invention is not lim- ited to only the embodiments specifically described here- in. While the foregoing description and drawings repre- sent a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it will be understood that various additions, modifications, and substitutions may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. In particular, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms, structures, arrangements, proportions, and with other elements, materials, and", "type": "Document"}}
