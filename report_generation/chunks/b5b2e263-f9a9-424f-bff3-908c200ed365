The device modelling engine 204 may include a machine learning system which uses machine learning to recognize the param- eters and operations of a particular device after training as a particular state or classification, and thus the different con- ditions of the device, after training, can be recognized within a level of accuracy based on operation information that is fed. within it.\n\n[0067] Preferably, the device modelling engine 204 includes a plurality of learning networks, each specifically structured and trained for each individual devices of a plurality of devices. Thus in the examples described below, where the device is a wind turbine in a wind farm which has multiple devices (wind turbines), each of the plurality of learning networks may be individually structured and trained to operate with a specific wind turbine of the wind. farm. In turn, when operation information obtained for a specific wind turbine is fed into an associated learning network, the operation conditions of the specific wind tur- bine can be modelled by the learning network and thus any abnormal functionalities or status updates of each wind. turbine can be determined or predicted based on the match- ing of the operation information against the modelling of the", "type": "Document"}}
