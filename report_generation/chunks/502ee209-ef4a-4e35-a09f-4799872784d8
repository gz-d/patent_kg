The measured and simulated boresight antenna gains (9=0) of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2 are 6.71 dBi at 2.57 GHz and 6.86 dBi at 2.49 GHz. As expected, the simulated antenna gains are slightly lower than those of the reference dielectric resonator antenna because the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2 has stronger cross-polar fields as a result of the generally rectangular groove. The results above show that the perfor- mance of the dielectric resonator antenna is substantially unaffected by the presence of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna.\n\n[0055] To investigate the influence of the wideband Fabry- Perot resonator antenna on the dielectric resonator antenna, a reference wideband solid dielectric resonator antenna excited in its TE,,,;* and TEL modes was also studied. For ease of comparison, the same dielectric resonator antenna dimensions and dielectric constant (\u00a2,=10.6) are used for the reference dielectric resonator antenna.", "type": "Document"}}
