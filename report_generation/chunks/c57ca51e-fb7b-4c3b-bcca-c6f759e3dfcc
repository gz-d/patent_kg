After receiving data from model 307, data are randomly divided\n\ninto training set 602, validation set 603 and testing set 604. Usually, the ratio of training set 602 may be imbalanced. Imbalanced data is a challenge for predictive modelling since most of algorithms are designed to handle balanced data. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is applied in element 602, 603 and 604 to handle the imbalanced data. AUROC, accuracy AUPRC, precision, recall, and f1-score are applied to measure the performance of models in element 603 and 604. The models with good performance are stored into element 607.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25", "type": "Document"}}
