Before the impinging water droplet engages the TIDE-G, the gate channel between the source and drain is absent. In this switching-off state/mode, there is no current output (please see top portion of figure). By comparison, in the switching- on state, the source and drain are connected by the spreading droplet, yielding a significant electricity generation (please see bottom portion of figure).\n\n[0005] Preferably, the glass substrate may be an ITO glass slide or a portion of an ITO glass slide.\n\n[0006] Suitably, the PTFE may be conformed to exist in form ofa flat film on the upwardly facing surface. The PTFE film may have a density of 2.1 to 2.2 g/em*. Studies leading to the present invention have shown that this density range can enhance the performance of the generator.\n\n[0007] Advantageously, the electrode may be a conductive Al tape.\n\n[0008] According to a second aspect of the present inven- tion, there is provided an electricity generator system com- prising a plurality of electricity generators as described above, wherein the generators are connected in series or in parallel.\n\n[0023] FIG. 1c is a graph showing that, with the progres- sion of continuous impinging of individual droplets, there is gradual increase in the charges on the PTFE surface of as-fabricated TIDE-G device.", "type": "Document"}}
