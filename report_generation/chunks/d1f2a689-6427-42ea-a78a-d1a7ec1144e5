In combination with the differentially-fed patch antenna (which can operate as power combiner), the out-of-phase coupling mode enables con- structive power combining for the oscillators (e.g., \u4e00 em cells) in each row. The in-phase coupling mode between rows enables power combining across the array.\n\n[0130] To better understand the design, a two-element oscillator is analyzed below to determine the condition both coupling modes.\n\nrealizing\n\n[0131] FIG. 1A shows a general two-element oscillator model in one example. In FIG. 1A, Z, and Z represent the equivalent input impedance of the two coupled cores. It is noted that the real parts of Zs or Zr are negative so that they can replenish the energy loss in the two-port coupler between Z, and Z,.\n\n[0132] In this example, the two-port coupler is modeled using Z parameters.
