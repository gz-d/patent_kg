The lowest detection\n\nUS 2024/0260899 Al\n\nlimit of the electronic fabric is one of the critical factors determining the scope of electronic skin applications.\n\nin\n\n[0098] Furthermore, two drops of water are utilized to evaluate the detection capability of the electronic fabric at extremely low pressures. As shown in FIG. 3F, the slight force imposed by a drop of water (~5 Pa) can be exactly detected by the electronic fabric. By comparing the maxi- mum sensing range and sensitivity with the previous studies, the electronic fabric of the present invention exhibits com- prehensive advantages (FIG. 3G), showing great potential in various application scenarios.\n\n[0099] The long-term piezoresistive stability of the elec- tronic fabric is further evaluated by a continuous compres- sion and separation test at 10 kPa; the current response under pressure is stable even after 3,000 cycles (FIG. 15). For a more comprehensive performance evaluation, various parameters, including response/recovery time and detection limit, are systematically compared and presented in Table 1. The results depicted in Table 1 clearly demonstrate that the C-PVDF/MXene-CNTs of the present invention exhibits superior performance across all parameters in comparison to other Ti;C,Tx or MXene materials encapsulated with PET, PE, or PDMS.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nSensing performance evaluation Detect Maximum Maximum limit sensitivity sensing Materials Encapsulation (Paj (kPa range (kPa) C-PVDF/MXene- Nonwoven 5 548.09 20 CNIS/PAN Nanofibers PANTAC2T, PET 1.5 104 & MXene/PDMS PE 44 1514 15 MXene/PVA/PDMS PDMS 0.88 403.46 18 CNTTiaC2T\u3002 PDMS \u4e00 0.245 13 Response/ recovery time (ms) 28.4/39.1 30/20 125/104, 105.3/99.3 \u4e00 \u4e00\n\nThe proposed sensing mechanism of the electronic\n\n[0100]", "type": "Document"}}
