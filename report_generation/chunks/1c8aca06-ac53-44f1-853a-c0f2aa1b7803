Fig. 1 shows a Table in- dicating the treatment conditions of the embodying oxy- gen PIII&D samples described in this disclosure, while Fig. 2A shows the results of an untreated titanium sam- ple, Fig. 2B shows the chemical profiles of the 50 Hz oxygen treated samples, and Fig. 2C shows the chemical profile of the 100 Hz oxygen treated samples. It can be observed from the figures that the oxygen content has been enriched at the Ti alloy surface. In addition, the thickness of the oxygen rich layer can be increased with the implantation frequency. [0029] In the same example implementation, the treat- ed titanium surface topography and roughness is evalu- ated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of the untreated and treated samples are shown in Figs. 3A-3C. The surface roughness can be indicated by the root mean square (RMS) value of the AFM surface to- pography plot of the samples. The RMS of the control is 40 \u00c5, the RMS of the 50 Hz oxygen treated sample is 22 \u00c5, and the RMS of the 100 Hz oxygen treated sample is 24 \u00c5. As indicated by Figs. 3A-3C, it can be seen that the treated surfaces are smoothened as compared to the non-treated surface. In particular, the roughness of the", "type": "Document"}}
