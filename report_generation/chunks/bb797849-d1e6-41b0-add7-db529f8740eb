Although the concept of a \u201clocalized charging principle\u201d has been disclosed previously in GB2389720A, U.S. Pat. No. 7,1642,55 and WO2007/ 019806, so far there is no systematic approach in designing an inductive battery charging pad that can meet the energy- efficiency, safety, electromagnetic compatibility require- ments simultaneously. In \u201cT. Sekitani, M. Takamiya, Y. Noguchi, S. Nakano, Y. Kato, K. Hizu, H. Kawaguchi, T. Sakurai, T. Someya, \u201cA large-area flexible wireless power transmission sheet using printed plastic MEMS switches and organic field-effect transistors,\u2019 JEDM '06, International Electron Devices Meeting, December 2006, pp. 1-4,\u201d a MEMS method has been proposed for inductive charging system, but such approach is restricted to relatively low- power and is very costly.\n\nTwo different approaches to planar battery charging devices have recently been proposed. The first type of planar battery charger modifies the rotating machine concept by flattening the \u201cround shape\u201d of the motor into a \u201cpancake shape,\u201d as shown in FIG. 1(a) and reported in GB2399225A, GB2398176A, WO2004/038888A, GB2388716A, US2003- 210106A, GB2392024A, and GB2399230A. The magnetic flux lines 1 flow along (i.e., roughly parallel to) the planar charging surface 2. However, such a horizontal flux approach requires a vertical surface to pick up the ac flux for voltage induction (FIG. 1(6)) and this limitation makes it difficult to design a slim energy-receiving module that can be unobtru- sively housed inside the equipment to be charged. Typically, as shown in FIG. 1(4) the secondary winding needs to be wound round a magnetic core 3.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
