Using CARPID, the present invention not only detects a number of previously reported XIST binding proteins, but also identifies many new factors, among which the present invention validates the TAF15 and SNF2L in this study through biochemical and functional verification. The data of the present invention supports the current consensus that XIST RNA regulates XCI by recruiting chromatin remodeling agents for chromosome condensation and iso- lating transcription mechanisms to further inhibit\n\ngenes.\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\n[0036] In order to maximize the credibility of the present invention and avoid false positive signals, the present inven- tion controls the changes at both the experimental and statistical levels. Firstly, a self-cleavable GFP fusion is used to monitor the expression of BASU enzyme in cells and minimize the reaction time required for effective biotin labeling. Secondly, a multi-site targeting strategy is adopted to specifically target three different loci on XIST, and new proteins identified with at least two gRNA pairs are further verified in the present invention. Thirdly, for each group of gRNA, at least three repeated CARPID experiments are repeated. In addition, a triple simulation control is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the enrichment.", "type": "Document"}}
