[0028] The principal and the auxiliary winding may be connected together in parallel or in series and may be driven in phase and the same polarity. Alternatively the auxiliary winding may be driven separately from the prin- cipal winding such that the flux generated by the auxiliary winding can be controlled so as to be sufficient to com- pensate for the voltage sag without generating any un- desirable flux peak as it is desirable that the flux gener- ated over the surface of the charging platform should be as uniform as possible. It will be understood that in preferred embodi- [0029] ments the present invention is particularly suitable for use with planar windings where the lateral dimensions (eg width and length of a rectangular winding or circum- ference of a circular winding) are substantially greater than the thickness or height of the winding whether it is a very thin winding such as a conductive track on a PCB, or a slightly thicker winding formed by a wire coil. Such windings may be considered in a general sense to lie in a plane even though they will nevertheless have a defined thickness even if it is small. However the invention may", "type": "Document"}}
