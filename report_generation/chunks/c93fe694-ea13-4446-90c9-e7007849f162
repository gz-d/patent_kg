Web-based analytic tools were used. Gene ontology analysis was performed in Metascape 3.0 (http:// metascape.org) to explore GO terms and enrichment analy- sis of target proteins. Terms with a p-value<0.01, a minimum count of 3, and enrichment factor>1.5 (the enrichment factor is the ratio between the observed counts and the counts expected by chance) were set as the cut off criteria. Subse- quently, the protein interaction biological networks of iden- tified proteins were constructed based on the STRING 11.0 database (http://www.string-db.org) under the standard set- tings. In addition, the network data was exported to simple tabular text. The text was used to build protein interaction networks, which were then visualized and evaluated in software\n\nTo determine the values of ko and K,,,, purified Sirt2 with 400 uM NAD+ was incubated with different concentrations of lipoylated peptide (0-120 uM) in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl,, and 2.7 mM KCl at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min (KAlip-1 and KAlip-10) or 5 min (KAlip-5 and KAlip-8). The reactions were quenched by adding 250 ML of methanol and then applied for HPLC analysis with a linear gradient of 5% to 85% B (acetonitrile) for 30 min. The generated delipoylated product was quan- tified based on the peak area monitored at 280 nm. The k,,,,. and K,,,, values were calculated by curve-fitting Vanax[E] versus [S]. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.", "type": "Document"}}
