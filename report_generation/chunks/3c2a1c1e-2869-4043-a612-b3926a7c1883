The LED lighting system of claim 1, wherein said volt- ripple reducing circuit is a valley-fill circuit located. between said rectification circuit and said second circuit.\n\ngenerating a current source from said voltage ripple reduced rectified DC power; and\n\nproviding said current source as an input to at least one LED, wherein the power supplied to said at least one LED is permitted to vary by use of a variable inductor, and wherein the operating and/or design parameters of said at least one LED are chosen such that the variation in luminous flux resulting from the variation in power is not observable to the human eye.\n\n3. The LED lighting system of claim 2, wherein said valley- circuit includes a first capacitor and a second capacitor.\n\n4. The LED lighting system of claim 3, wherein the first and second capacitors have the same capacitance.\n\n5. The LED lighting system of claim 3, wherein the first and second capacitors have different capacitances such that the voltage ripple of said rectified DC power is further reduced.\n\n22. The method of claim 21, wherein a thermal character- istic of the at least one said LED is chosen such that variation in luminous flux resulting from the variation is not observable to the human eye.\n\n6. The LED lighting system of claim 2, wherein said valley- fill circuit includes a voltage-doubler.\n\n7. The LED lighting system of claim 1, wherein said circuit comprises an inductor.\n\nThe method of claim 22, wherein said thermal charac- teristic comprises the design of the heatsink.\n\n8. The LED lighting system of claim 1, wherein said sec- circuit is a current ripple reduction circuit.\n\n24. The method of claim 22, wherein said thermal charac- teristic comprises the provision of forced cooling or natural cooling.\n\n9. The LED lighting system of claim 1, wherein means are provided for controlling the sensitivity of the LED power to fluctuations in the voltage of the AC input power.", "type": "Document"}}
