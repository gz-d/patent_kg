A person skilled in the art would appreciate suitable circuits for the present invention.\n\n[0078] In another aspect, the present invention pertains to amethod of using the neurostimulation system of the present invention to modulate the abnormal motor movement of a subject. The method includes the use of the neurostimulation system as described above, and the subject is also as defined above. In particular, the method includes the steps of:\n\n[0079] implanting a EMG electrode in the subject, wherein the EMG electrode is in communication a data acquisition unit which receives and transmits EMG signal;\n\n[0088] After the fabrication, electrodes were tested using oscilloscope and stimulus isolator to check the flow current and connection.\n\n[0089] Referring to FIG. 2B, there is shown the set-up implantation of electrodes.\n\nimplanting a neural electrode in a DCN of subject preferably human;\n\n[0081] processing the EMG signal via a processor to generate a EMG pattern based on the EMG signal, and outputting a stimulation signal to the neural electrode when the EMG pattern is indicative of the abnormal motor movement.\n\nimplantation of Neural Electrodes at Deep Cerebellar Nuclei", "type": "Document"}}
