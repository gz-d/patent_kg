Means for achieving increased compression yielding in a plastic hinge 20 of a flexural member 10 include the use of a compression yielding device, in particular:\n\nThe encased mechanism may be cast or installed into flexural member to form a ductile compression zone.\n\nViewed from another broad aspect the invention also pro- vides a method of modifying a flexural member comprising casting an amount of ductile compressive material into the compression zone of the plastic hinge or near the plastic hinge the flexural member.\n\ncompression yielding device comprising ductile com- pression material 30 that replaces concrete 15 within ductile compression zone 40 (such as that shown in 1); and\n\nViewed from another broad aspect the invention also pro- vides a method of modifying a flexural member comprising inserting a ductile compressive mechanism into the compres- sion zone of the plastic hinge of the flexural member or nearby to the plastic hinge.\n\n2) A compression yielding device comprising a ductile mechanism 50 within the compression zone 40 (such as that shown in FIG. le and FIG. 2).\n\nThe invention may also broadly be said to consist in any alternative combination of features as described or shown in the accompanying examples. Known equivalents of these features not expressly set out are nevertheless deemed to be included.", "type": "Document"}}
