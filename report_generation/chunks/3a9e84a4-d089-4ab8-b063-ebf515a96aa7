By Faraday\u2019s law, an AC voltage will be induced in the secondary winding. In this invention, the two termi- nals of the secondary resonant tank are connected to a diode rectifier and a capacitor as shown in Fig.13. The use of this diode rectifier and a smoothing capacitor is important. Firstly, the diode rectifier turns the induced AC voltage in the winding into a rectified DC voltage and the DC capacitor reduces the AC voltage ripple so that a fairly constant DC voltage can be made available for the charging protection circuit. Secondly, the diode rec- tifier prevents any current from flowing into the secondary resonant tank formed by Lr and Cr when a traditional battery charger is plugged into the charged equipment. This feature can be explained with the use of the block diagram as shown in Fig.14. As the introduction of the proposed inductive charging device should not affect the use of a traditional power adaptor, it is important that the new circuit should allow the electronic equipment to be charged by both a planar inductive charging platform and a traditional power adaptor. If a traditional power adaptor is plugged into the charging socket of the electronic equipment, the terminals DC+ 1404 and DC- 1406 will be connected to terminals IN+ 1408 and IN- 1410 of the battery pack through the mechanical contacts in the charging socket. The presence of the diode rectifier is crucial here because it prevents any current from the traditional power adaptor from flowing into the \"second- ary winding\". [0030] A further proposal in this invention is to incor- porate the resonant capacitor Cr, the diode rectifier and the DC capacitor Cdc into the existing charging protection circuit as shown in Fig.15. In this way, the two terminals of the secondary winding can simply be connected to the inputs 1510, 1512 of the modified charging protection circuit.
