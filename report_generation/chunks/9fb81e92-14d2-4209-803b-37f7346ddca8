DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART\n\nIn recent years, two-dimensional transition metal\n\n[0003]\n\ndichalcogenide (TMDc), as an emerging two-dimensional material, has high carrier mobility, mechanical flexibility, chemical stability and photosensitivity, and is an ideal candidate material for future flexible electronic, optoelec- tronic and photovoltaic devices. Two-dimensional ReS, is preferred over other TMDc materials for its highly sym- metrical structure. It has the characteristics of distorted 1T phase and in-plane anisotropy. Meanwhile, it keeps direct bandgap with increasing thickness due to interlayer decou- pling property. These characteristics make it not only suit- able for electronics and photovoltaics field like other two- dimensional materials, it also has great development potential in the fields of flexible devices, anisotropic pho- todetectors and integrated polarization controllers that are\n\nsensitive to polarized light.\n\n[0004] At present, the single-layer ReS, is usually pro- duced by mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapor depo- sition (CVD), however, the mechanical exfoliation can only produce a limited number of single-layer ReS, that is rela- tively small in size. For the preparation of large-scale single-layer ReS,, the CVD method is favored over the mechanical exfoliation. Further, existing methods for modu- lating the structure of 2-D materials are usually complicated, and there are few reports on the structure modulated single- layer ReS,.\n\n[0005] The present disclosure aims to provide a modulated structure of single-layer ReS, by use of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, such structure has a wide potential application in optics, electrics, mechanics, sensor etc.\n\nSUMMARY", "type": "Document"}}
