The sputtering source can be, for example, aluminum oxide (Al,O,). Tables 3 shows the process conditions during the magnetron sputtering process. All values listed will work with slight variations, such that each value could be inter- preted as having the word \u201cabout\u201d in front of it. 30 35\n\nTABLE 6\n\nTABLE 3\n\nProcess conditions with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane Silane coupling agent Solvent Catalyst Treatment Temperature Silane Treatment. 3-Aminoproyltrimethylsilane (Weight of Mg/Volume of ASCA: 1 g/ml-20 g/ml) Cyclohexane/Toluene Tricthylamine 60\u00b0 C.-80\u00b0 C/B0\u00b0 C-110\u00b0 C.
