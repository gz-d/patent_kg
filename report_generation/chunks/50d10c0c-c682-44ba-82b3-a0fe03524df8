It may be the step of forming an anode. In one example, the anode may be a zinc anode. The zine anode may be prepared by electrodepositing zinc metal onto a substrate. Preferably, the substrate is a SS mesh. Alterna- tively, the substrate may be selected from carbon cloth, carbon nanotube (CNT) paper, carbon paper, nickel/copper alloy cloth or steel sheet. The electrodeposition time may depend on the thickness requirement, which may depend on the operational life of the electrical energy storage device.\n\n[0178] The second crosslinked structure also includes a plurality of PAAm chains crosslinked together by forming hydrogen bonds with a crosslinking agent such as ethylene glycol (EG) at a particular bonding site as shown in FIG. 2B. The bonding site is where the interaction between the amide group of the PAAm chains and hydroxyl group of the EG to occur. The EG may further interact with water molecules by forming at least one hydrogen bond with the water mol- ecules. As such, the water molecules are kept apart from each other and prevented from crystallization (i.e. forming ice) when the electrolyte is subjected to subzero tempera- tures.", "type": "Document"}}
