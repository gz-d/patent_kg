The system of claim 1, wherein at least one power switch of the subset of power switches is further configured to be a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) switch.\n\n16. The method of claim 13, further comprising:\n\ncontrolling switching of at least one of a first low-side power switch or at least one other low-side power switch to switch at least one of the first low-side power switch or the at least one other low-side power switch to an off state, during a period of time that the SDGD subsystem is not operating in the steady state, wherein the subset of power switches comprises the first low-side power switch and the at least one other low-side power switch, wherein the second power switch is the first low-side power switch.\n\n13. A method comprising:\n\n25\n\ngenerating a power signal response to an power signal received by a subset of power switches, wherein respective power switches of the subset power switches are arranged with respect to each other to emulate functionality of a diode rectifier;\n\nsupplying at least a portion of the rectified power signal to a self-driven gate-drive (SDGD) subsystem associated with the subset of power switches to facilitate control- ling respective switching of the respective power switches of the subset of power switches, wherein the SDGD subsystem comprises a subset of switches that form an inverter to facilitate the controlling of the switching of a first power switch of the subset of power switches based at least in part on respective switch states of the subset of switches;\n\n17. The method of claim 13, wherein the input power signal a voltage level that is greater than or equal to 100 volts.\n\na subset of power switches that is configured to receive an input voltage signal and rectify the input voltage signal to generate a rectified voltage signal as an output;", "type": "Document"}}
