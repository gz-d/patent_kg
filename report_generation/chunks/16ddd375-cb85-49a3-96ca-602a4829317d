Moreover, this topology is suitable for high-efficiency third harmonic extraction. In some embodiments of the topology, there is no explicit path to guide the third harmonic current to the lossy gate, as shown in FIG. 5, thus can reduce the harmonic current feedback loss in a simple way.\n\n[0189] In some examples, however, an implicit third har- monic current feedback to the gate through the parasitic gate-drain or gate-source capacitor may still exist.\n\n[0190] FIG. 13 shows an equivalent AC lumped circuit at 3fo of a one-quarter circuit in the 1x2 unit cell in FIG. 4B. As shown in FIG. 13, the third harmonic current generated within the transistor is modeled as a current source. If the impedance of the source termination at 3f, is small, the 3f, current can directly flow to the ground rather than going back to the gate lossy resistor R, through C,,. On the other hand, if the impedance of the gate termination at 3fo is large enough, the 3f, current flowing to R, through C,,, can also be reduced. In one embodiment of the topology, the source termination is connected to a capacitor, which naturally has a low impedance at 3f,, as shown in FIG. 13. The gate termination at 3f, has a relatively large equivalent imped- ance. The simulated power loss at 3fo in the lossy gate resistor is about 1 W, which is much lower than the power delivered to the antenna (about 140 W) close to the peak\n\nvalue in FIG. 12.", "type": "Document"}}
