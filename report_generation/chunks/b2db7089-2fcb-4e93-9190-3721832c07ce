The treated cells were UV-irradiated and subjected to click reaction with biotin azide (Bio-N;). The cells were then lysed and enriched with streptavidin beads. The enriched proteins were finally analysed by Western blotting with anti-Sirt2. As shown in FIG. 4, Sirt2 was successfully pulled down by KPlip. In contrast, Sirt2 was not observed in the absence of probe or with the control probe (KPlip-C) (FIG. 4). These results unambiguously demonstrated that endogenous Sirt2 may be pulled down by lipoylated pep- tides under a native cellular environment. In addition, a pull-down assay was also performed to validate the binding of HDAC8/BRMSIL to Klip. The results showed that both proteins may be effectively pulled down by KPlip. This is consistent with the LC-MS/MS results.\n\nKPlip. HEK 293 cell lysates were preincubated with DMSO or a lipoylated peptide competitor (VQSDK,,ASVT, FIG. 1c) at 100 1M. Subsequently the lysates were labelled with probe KPlip (10 UMD by UV irradiation. The probe-labelled proteomes were then conjugated with biotin azide, enriched by streptavidin beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin, and finally analysed by label-free LC-MS/MS quantitation. High-specificity binders of KPlip were defined as those showing substantial signal decrease (3-fold) in the presence of the competitor. This led to a total of 588 proteins identified. The proteins identified in both the probe-selec- tivity and competition experiments were compared resulting in a high-confidence list of 67 KPlip-binding proteins.", "type": "Document"}}
