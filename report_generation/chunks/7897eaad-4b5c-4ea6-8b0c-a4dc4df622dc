In use of the embodiment of FIG. 1, the conductive rod 7 and the sample holder 6 are connected to a source of negative potential and a highly negative voltage (eg 15 kV) is applied to the sample holder 6. The negative potential may be applied as a series of pulses, or in a long-pulse pseudo DC manner. In contrast the feed con- duit 4, thermally insulating wall 11, and the shield 15 sur- rounding the evaporation chamber 16 are all electrically grounded, therefore an electric field is established between the exit opening 3 of the feed conduit 4 (which is grounded and thus acts as an anode) and the negatively charged sample holder 6. The area of the exit opening 3 is much less than that of the sample holder 6. The electrons in the plasma as well as the secondary electron exited from the sample holder 6 will all fly to the exit opening 3, a focused electric field is formed between the exit opening 3 and the sample holder 6. To form this focused electric field, the ratio of the anode (exit opening 3) to cathode (sample holder 6) should be more than 6. The electric field acts to ionize the sulfur vapor entering the implantation chamber 2 through the exit opening 3 forming an electron cloud/plasma 20. Sulfur ions are then accelerated in the direction of arrows 21 under the influence of the electric field and are accelerated towards the sample 5 in which\n\nIn the following analysis\n\nP,\u00bbp\u2014pressure in the implantation chamber 2\n\nP.ounce=bressure in the evaporation chamber 17 (ifa carrier gas is used P,..,,,.. reflects the combined pressure of the vapor and the carrier gas) and is determined by the evaporation rate and the gas flow rate\n\nUnwe=conductance of the feed conduit 4 determined by the length and diameter of the conduit 4 and the average speed of the vaporized atoms\n\nS,ump=the pumping speed of pump 9", "type": "Document"}}
