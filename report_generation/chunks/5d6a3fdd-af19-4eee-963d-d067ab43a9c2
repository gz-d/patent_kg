All or most of the middle portion 223 is received in the hollow space 212 such that both the first and second ends 222, 224 protrude out of the hollow space 212. The first end 222 is provided with a core tip or cone tip 226. The core tip 226 is shaped substantially as a cone and has a cone radius, R1, greater than zero, at the conical head of the core tip 226.\n\n[0052] The electric coil 230 is wounded onto the externa\u2019 surface of the elongated sleeve 210 and when energized, generates the magnetic field. By way of example, the electric coil 230 includes copper wire. The turn number of the electric coil 230 is in a range from 1000 to 2000, such as 1400. The diameter of the enameled copper wire for wind- ings is in a range from 1.5 mm to 3 cm. The electric coil 230 has a total resistance in a range from 1Q to 3Q. The electric coil 230 can be energized with a maximum current in a range from 1 A to 30 A. These numeral values are for illustrating purpose only.
