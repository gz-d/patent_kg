This can be fabricated on one layer of a printed circuit board structure for low power applications, though for high power applications it should be an actual winding. It should be noted that, for an individual winding pattern in the array, the magnitude of the magnetic flux is highest in the center of the spiral winding. The magnitude of the magnetic flux is smallest in the small gap between adjacent winding patterns.\n\nsecond\n\nwith\n\ntransformer\n\nA layer a 3x4 winding array is shown in Fig.8. The individual winding pattems in both layers are identical. As shown in Fig.9, by having the two layers of arrays arranged in such a manner that the center (region of maximum magnetic flux magnitude) of a winding pattern on one layer is placed on the gap (region of minimum magnetic flux magnitude) between adjacent winding pattems on the other layer, the variation of the magnetic field magnitude can be minimized and the magnetic flux magnitude can therefore be made as even as possible over the overlapped surface. The essence of the multi-layer transformer arrays is to have a displacement between the individual winding patterns of the two layers so that the regions of the maximum\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n11\n\nmagnetic field magnitude of one layer is \u201cevened out\u201d by the regions of the minimum magnetic field magnitude,\n\nIn order to\n\nexamine the \u2018uniform magnetic field magnitude\u2019 feature of the proposed", "type": "Document"}}
