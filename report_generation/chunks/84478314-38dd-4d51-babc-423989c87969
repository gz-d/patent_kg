In some embodiments, the detector DD detects the thumb-to-index finger move- ment by generating an electric field around the ring-worn position around the index finger. The receiving electrode layer 114 receives a transmitted alternating current (AC) signal through a capacitive path between the transmitting electrode layer 116 and the receiving electrode layer 114 in response to the input electrical signal V,. When the wearer\u2019s TG hand or finger intrudes an electrical field generated by the AC signal, the low-frequency energy is capacitively coupled into the human body. Since the human body is much larger than the size of the electrode, the portion of the human body that is out of the electrical field serves as another charge reservoir. In other words, the coupling of the human body causes the change of the capacitance of the detector DD. Such changes can be processed to track the body movements and classify the movement patterns. When the relative movements between the thumb finger and the index finger occur, the capacitance changes, and the output elec- trical signal V (ie., output voltage signal) from the receiv- ing electrode portions RP of the receiving electrode layer\n\n114 also changes correspondingly.", "type": "Document"}}
