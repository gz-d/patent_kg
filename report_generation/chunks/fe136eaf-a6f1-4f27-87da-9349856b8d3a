This makes them suitable for integration into different planar technologies. The coupling between a DRA and a planar transmission line can be easily controlled by varying the position of the DRA with respect to the line. The performance of DRA can therefore be easily optimized experimentally.\n\nFIG. 6 is a graph of measured antenna gains of the hemi- spherical DRA with and without (g=0 mm) the solar cell;\n\nFIG. 7 comprises simulated and measured normalized radiation patterns of the hemispherical DRA with the under- solar cell;\n\nFIG. 8 provides a top-down view of the Coherent Sabre Innova Argon Laser system for generating parallel blue light\n\nmicrowave and optical functions into a single piece of dielec- tric resonator material. In a first described embodiment, a non-focusing lens is simultaneously used as the DRA. The footprint of the system is minimized because the solar cell panel is placed beneath the DRA. In a second described. embodiment, the DRA is shaped to focus light and is use a focusing lens for the solar cell. By incorporating a transpar- ent shaped DRA, the output voltage and current of the under- laid solar cell can be increased. In addition, the DRA al works as a radiating element (antenna). The dual function can reduce costs. In another embodiment, the DRA is shaped to conform to a light emitting bulb to form a lamp or the like. The DRA of any of these embodiments can be incorporated as a dual or multi-function element in an electronic device. The DRA can act as a light transmissible element for an optical component whilst acting as a protective cover for said other component. Furthermore, the DRA can act as a light focusing", "type": "Document"}}
