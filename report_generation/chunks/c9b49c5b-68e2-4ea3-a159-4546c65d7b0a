In this example, the passive output component is a capacitor 18 and forms with an inductor 19 an LC output filter. The controller stage 16 senses the output voltage v, of the voltage regulator 10, compares it with a reference v,,, of the voltage regulator, receives some system variables such as inductor current, switch voltage, switch current, etc, and uses these to derive a control signal to command a control variable, typically duty cycle, to the PCS 14, so as to regulate v, to converge it to Vrer The command variable is applied to a gate driver circuit 40 for changing the duty cycle ofa switching device 42. The capaci- tor 18 is connected in parallel with a load impedance \u201cZr 20 of the voltage regulator 10.\n\nIt can be seen connection of the compensator circuit 122 to the voltage regulator output stage requires only simple recon- nection of the voltage regulator output stage without affecting the feedback control loop 132 of the voltage regulator 110. The controller stage 116 of the voltage regulator 110 still receives the reference voltage signal as one input and the voltage regulator output voltage signal as another input in a similar manner to the typical voltage regulator depicted by FIG. 9.", "type": "Document"}}
