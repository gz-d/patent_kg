The separator may be placed closer to the anode than the spacer, and may be a glass fiber. The electrolyte may be a liquid, gel, or solid electrolyte, e.g., sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSD, sodium bis(trif- luoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSD, or sodium hexafluo- rophosphate (NaPF,). The electrolyte may further include a solvent, e.g., diglyme or 1-methy]l-1-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (py13TFSI). Preferably, the electrolyte has a concentration of about 0.5 M to about 4.0 M of the above material in the solvent.\n\n[0058] The cathode 36 may include the COF, a conductive material, a binder, and a current collector. The conductive material may include conductive carbon, such as Super P, Ketjen Black, or carbon nanotube, etc. The binder may include polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).

Preferably, the mass ratio of the COF, the conductive material, and the binder in the slurry is about 7:2:1 to about 3:6:1. The step of drying may be performed in a vacuum oven at about 30\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C., about 50\u00b0 C. to about 130\u00b0 C., or about 60\u00b0 C. to about 120\u00b0 C., for about 3 h to about 48 h, about 5 h to about 36 h, or about 6 h to about 24 h.\n\nof the\n\nembodiment, the\n\nIn", "type": "Document"}}
