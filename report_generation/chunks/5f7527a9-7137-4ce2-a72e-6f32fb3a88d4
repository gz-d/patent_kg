FIG. 5D shows the signal record of words spoken together in three trials, indicating the consistency of the voice signal. Interestingly, the experimental signal results represent the similar characteristic peaks existing in corresponding tones of word signals. Pulse waves provide vital information on heart conditions and related diseases. Generally, a radial artery waye can be observed with the characteristic percus- sion, tidal, and diastolic peaks (P-wave, T-wave, and D-wave, respectively). Further, the electronic fabric is applied to monitor human pulse waves by attaching the electronic fabric to the wrist (FIGS. 5E-5F). FIG. 5E shows the pulse wave of a 28-year-old male man before and after work-out. The pulse rate and amplitude are both increased after a 10 min rope skipping exercise, and the waveform is changed as well. Specifically, the pulse rate increases from 66 beats per minute (BPM) in the resting state to 104 BPM in the exercising state. The tidal peak comes to be blurred", "type": "Document"}}
