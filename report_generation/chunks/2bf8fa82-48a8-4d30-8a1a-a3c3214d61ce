At 1002, a signal region can be formed in a 2-D video image of video content. The signal region can be sized (e.g., in terms of physical size, the number of pixels, and/or the number of data bits that can be contained within the control region) and shaped (e.g., square, circle, oval, rectangle, etc.) as desired so that it can contain information, such as a signal, therein, wherein the signal can correspond to the type of video content being\n\nAt 1104, a signal can be detected (e.g., automatically or dynamically, in real time) in the control region of the projec- tor screen component in relation to presentation of the 2-D visual image(s) on the projector screen component. The 2-D visual image(s) can be presented on the projector screen component. The signal embedded in the 2-D visual image(s) can be presented in the control region of the projector screen component. The sensor component can detect or sense the signal presented (e.g., emitted) in the control region of the projector screen component.", "type": "Document"}}
