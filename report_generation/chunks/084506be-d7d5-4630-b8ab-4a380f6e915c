The dielectric resonator antenna 100 includes, generally, a cylindrica dielectric resonator element 102 and a substrate assembly 104 attached to and supporting the dielectric resonator element 102. The cylindrical dielectric resonator element 102 is a solid element with a radius of R, height of H, anc dielectric constant \u00a2,. The substrate assembly 104 has a generally circular form.\n\n[0024] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the antenna configured for WLAN applications, e.g., 2.4 GHz WLAN Applications.\n\n[0025] In accordance with a second aspect of the inven- tion, there is provided an antenna having multiple ports or an antenna array having multiple antennas of the first aspect. The dielectric resonator elements of the antennas can be formed integrally. The antenna may be a multiple-port antenna, a MIMO antenna, etc.", "type": "Document"}}
