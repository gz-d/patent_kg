As shown in Fig. 3d, the charge is linearly proportional to We: as the We increases from 27.6 to 130.9 varying the releasing height, the transferred charges increase from 21.9 nC to 68 nC. contrast, without the use of a transistor-like design, the measured charges on TENG are negligible and insensitive to We or the maximum spreading area, Amax ~ We. Also, there is no notable difference in the charges measured from the droplets departing from TIDE-G and TENG. Please see Fig. 11. Thus, the fidelity of the amount of transferred charges between the source and drain response to varying We suggests that the electricity generation is exquisitely regulated by the interaction between the impinging droplet and the unique configuration of the TIDE-G, rather than from the interfacial contact electrification.\n\nv\n\nby\n\nin\n\noriginating\n\nThe behavior of the efficient and continuous electricity generation from the transistor-like", "type": "Document"}}
