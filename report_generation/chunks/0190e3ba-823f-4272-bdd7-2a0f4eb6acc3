How- ever, haptic devices designed for the ear are relatively less explored. For example, Orecchio wearable device has experimented various static and dynamic auricular postures for extending the body-language, but with a focus on onlookers\u2019 perception of ear movement. Emoti-chair and the use of a vibratory earphone on the pinna used the vibratory sense to enhance the emotion of sound. Recently, Lee et al. developed ActivEarring to provide the spatial vibrotactile feedback on the ear. Their studies showed that the users can perceive a set of sequential vibrotactile patterns with an average accuracy over 80%. While the force-based and the vibrotactile feedback for wearable devices have started gaining more and more research interest, the thermal wear- able is still under-explored. Recently, researchers presented the design of thermohaptic wearable display for the hearing and visually impaired users, by installing two miniature Peltier modules on each side of the eathooks. However, how users may perceive such auricular spatial thermal feedback\n\nis still unknown.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0012] The present invention integrates thermal haptic feedback in an earhook form factor for providing a wearable device. More specifically, the present invention provides a wearable device that can provide hot and cold stimuli at multiple points on the auricular skin area To investigate users\u2019 thermal perception around the auricular area, we developed three ThermEarhook prototypes with 3, 4, and 5\n\nUS 2023/0122309 Al", "type": "Document"}}
