The magnetic flux lines flow horizontally along (roughly in parallel to) the planar charging surfaces. The portable electronic equipment to be charged by the charging device needs a secondary wind- ing wound on preferably a soft magnetic core. An AC voltage will be induced in this secondary winding for charging the battery, usually via a battery charging circuit. 50\n\nThe first-stage power converter may be either current con- trolled or voltage-controlled. Preferably, the current fed to primary winding is monitored to provide a feedback control the variable DC link voltage.\n\nA fundamental and inherent limitation of this type of bat- tery charger is that this charging device must have a good. electromagnetic flux guide to confine the flux along the lower surface. Otherwise, if such a charging device is placed on a metallic table or a conductive surface, induced current will circulate in the metallic table or conductive surface, resulting in heat generation and power loss in the metallic table or conductive surface. One imperfect way to solve this problem\n\nsome invention, a step-down trans- former may be provided between the output of the second- stage power inverter and the primary winding.\n\nThe second-stage power inverter may comprise a resonant tank that sets the frequency of the AC current supplied to the winding. In such embodiments, the second-stage power inverter is switched at a constant frequency that is equal to the frequency of the resonant tank.\n\nInductive electronic\n\nwith\n\ndirect connection have\n\na\n\n35\n\nquency constant\n\ncurrent to\n\nprimary winding.\n\nthe\n\nof\n\nIn\n\nembodiments of the\n\nUS 8,228,025 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPreferably, the secondary side is adapted to receive power", "type": "Document"}}
