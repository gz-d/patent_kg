A method for controlling a deflector in an imaging apparatus, wherein the imaging apparatus comprises an electron gun arranged to provide electron beam to scan a specimen, and the deflector, the deflector is arranged to move the electron beam in a first scanning direction and a second scanning direction that are in the same plane for scanning the specimen, wherein the method comprises:\n\nwherein the predetermined equations are applied when \u5c0f is smaller than 10 degrees.\n\ndetermining the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction;\n\n14. The control unit of claim 1, wherein the control unit comprises an analog circuit arranged to provide the control to the deflector.\n\nprocessing scanning determined second scanning direction based on prede- termined equations; and\n\n15. The control unit of claim 1, wherein the control unit comprises a field-programmable gate array circuit arranged provide the control signal to the deflector.\n\nproviding, based on the processing, a control signal to the deflector to adjust one or both of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction such that (i) the first scanning direction and the second adjusted scanning direction are within a required orthogonality limit or (ii) the first adjusted scanning direction and the second adjusted scanning direction are within a required orthogonality limit.\n\n16. The control unit of claim 1, wherein the imaging apparatus is an electron microscope.\n\n17. The control unit of claim 16, wherein the imaging apparatus is a scanning electron microscope.\n\n18. The control unit of claim 16, wherein the imaging apparatus is an inspection apparatus for inspecting semicon- ductors.\n\nee Ok kk\n\n\u4e2d\n\ndeflector based on A and B; and\n\nsignal\n\nto\n\nthe determined first\n\ndirection and the", "type": "Document"}}
