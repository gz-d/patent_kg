The neural electrode 104, as discussed above, is preferably implanted in a DCN. The DCN includes dentate nucleus, emboliform nucleus, globose nucleus, and fastigii nucleus. The neural electrode 104 may be implanted. to stimulate at least two or more of the dentate nucleus, emboliform nucleus, globose nucleus, and fastigii nucleus.\n\n[0069] In an alternative embodiment, the processor 108 is PC/104 based computer system, optionally a micro-sized PC/104 based computer system, with built-in connectors.\n\n[0070] The processor 108 may communicate with the data acquisition unit 106 via a wired or wireless network. It would be understood that the processor 108 may be config- ured in various shapes or incorporated with another device.
