During training, this initialization causes the probability of transitioning from the preference-biased to the exploration period to stay at O (since all potential sequences that transition from the preference-biased to the exploration period are given probability zero). The transition matrices of the low-level states were initialized as uniform distributions. After the initialization, the Gaussian ROIs and transition probabilities were updated in the EM algorithm.\n\nEXAMPLE 9\u2014Clustering to discover common\n\npatterns\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n28\n\nTo examine the\n\nall individuals\n\nmovement\n\ngeneral eye pattern adopted by during exploration period, an HMM was created using the exploration transition matrix and Gaussian emissions for each individual, and these HMMs were clustered or summarized into one group using the Variational Hierarchical Expectation Maximization (VHEM) algorithm (see, e.g., Coviello et al., 2014). The VHEM algorithm clusters HMMs into a predefined number of groups according to their probability distributions and characterizes each group using a representative HMM. A similar procedure was performed to obtain the general eye movement for the preference-biased period.\n\nthe\n\npattern\n\ndifferences in decision making behavior, the participants\u2019\n\nTo examine individual", "type": "Document"}}
