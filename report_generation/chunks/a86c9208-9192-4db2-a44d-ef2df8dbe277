With the load resistance increasing from 1 KO to\n\n100 MO , the output voltage varies from 0.45 V to 170 V and\n\nmeasured maximum charges Qmax transferred from the\n\nthe output current decreases from 410 uA to 1.55 \u00b0 A . The\n\nsource to drain as a function of the Weber number was\n\nmaximum power density is 69.8 W / m\u00b2 when the load resis\n\nmeasured . Please see FIG . 12 , wherein We = pDv ly , where\n\nD , v and y are the diameter , impact velocity and surface\n\ntance is 33.2 KO . Please see FIG . 9. The power density is\n\nthree orders of magnitude higher than that of its counter\n\ntension of the droplet , respectively . As shown in FIG . 3d , the\n\nparts . Referring to FIG . 10 , when being kept under a\n\ncharge is linearly proportional to We : as the We increases\n\nfrom 27.6 to 130.9 by varying the releasing height , the\n\nhumidity of 40 RH % for 30 days , the device exhibits no\n\nnotable decay in the output , with measured charge stabilized\n\ntransferred charges increase from 21.9 nC to 68 nC . In\n\ncontrast , without the use of a transistor - like design , the\n\nat ~ 49 nC . Further tests were conducted to verify the\n\npractical application of TIDE - G in that a 10 uF capacitor\n\nmeasured charges on TENG are negligible and insensitive to\n\nwas charged through a typical full - wave rectifier under\n\nWe or the maximum spreading area , Amar ~ We . Also , there\n\ncontinuous drop impinging . Within a period of 170 s , the\n\nis no notable difference in the charges measured from the\n\ncapacitor can be charged to 3.1 V.
