As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the maximum co-polar field is found in the boresight direction (9=0?). It is stronger than its cross-polar counterpart by more than 22 dB. The measured H-plane radiation pattern (yz-plane, @=90\u00b0) is not symmetric although the filter-antenna 400 is symmetric about the xz-plane. This may be caused by experimental imperfections including assembly errors. It was found that the radiation patterns are stable over the targeted ISM band (5725-5.875 GHz) (results not illustrated).\n\n[0060] The filter-antenna in the above embodiments may reduce, avoid, or prevent the energy in the stopband from reflecting back to the source or other components, by absorbing or dissipating the energy through a filter (esp., resistor). The energy in the passband is transmitted to the antenna, whereas the energy in the stopbands is absorbed by the filter (esp., resistor). As a result, the energy reflection is greatly reduced or even eliminated in both the passband and stopbands, which avoid possible detrimental effects on the source or other components.", "type": "Document"}}
