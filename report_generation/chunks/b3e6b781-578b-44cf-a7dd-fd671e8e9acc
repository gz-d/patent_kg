Accordingly, the present invention also pertains to a kit comprising the modified protein as described above.\n\nIn an embodiment, the modified protein includes one, two, or all three of the following mutations at the R245, N419 or R654 positions and three E782K,N968K and R1015H mutations and a mutation at an N413 position. In a particular embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 4 of a homologue thereof wherein the modified protein includes mutations at the N413, N419, R245 and R654 positions and three E782K,N968K,R1015H mutations, also referred to as KKH-SaCas9-HF. In an embodiment, the mutation at one or more of the N413, N419, R245 and/or R654 positions is a single amino acid substitution. Preferably, the modified protein comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence includes an alanine at the N413, N419, R245 and/or R654 positions.\n\nIn an embodiment, the kit includes a modified Cas9 protein with a mutation at an N413 position, and optionally one or more of a nuclear localization sequence, a cell penetrating peptide sequence, an affinity tag and/or a fusion base editor protein. In one embodiment, the modified protein includes an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 1 or a homologue thereof wherein the modified protein comprising the amino acid sequence includes a mutation at an N413 position.", "type": "Document"}}
