The second-stage power inverter may be, for example, a full-bridge type, or a half- bridge type, or a Class D type or a Z-source type inverter.\n\nIn the following, methods and apparatus that can provide power control and AC flux control for the inductive charging pad are described. In order to meet the criteria mentioned previously, the following design and operating conditions are set so that the charging pad can be used to charge a wide range of electronic loads and to enable the flux that is generated by the excited windings to be controlled.\n\nPreferably, when excited, each primary winding is excited the same frequency and generates the same AC magnetic flux. The AC current supplied to the primary winding is preferably sinusoidal.\n\n(1) One or more windings of the charging pad are excited and may be termed as an \u201cactive group.\u201d A common magnitude of AC magnetic flux may be set for each coil on the charging pad so that the AC magnetic field created by each energized coil would be identical. This allows the electronic products to be charged in the same manner anywhere over the charging surface of the charging pad.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic showing the control methodology according to one example of the invention,", "type": "Document"}}
