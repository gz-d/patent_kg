For example, in some cases, the receptors may not have a functional group that is reactive enough to react with the active layer; thereby a harsh reaction condition may be required to anchor/immobilize the receptors on the mem- brane. Such a harsh reaction condition may cause deterio- ration to the receptors, particularly when the receptors are nucleotides or peptides, rendering a reduction or a loss of function of the receptors.\n\n[0067] By the use of a coupling agent with functional groups that are reactive toward both the receptors and the membrane, the reaction condition required would become milder, increasing the chance of preserving the functionality of the receptors. In addition, the coupling agent may prevent cross-linking between adjacent receptors, particularly when the receptors are aptamers (i.e. oligo-RNA, oligo-DNA or peptides). Thus, the binding between the receptors and the target substance would not be hindered by said cross- linking.\n\n[0073] With reference to FIGS. 6A to 6D, there is shown an example embodiment of detecting an antigen of gastric cancer, CA72-4 using the electrochemical detector 100. In this example, the electrochemical detector may be imple- mented as a cylindrical plastic solution chamber 602 (FIGS. 6A and 6B). The chamber has a length of 60 mm and a diameter of 50 mm. Such compact size of the detector may advantageously allow a user to carry the detector easily so as to carry out operations such as point-to-point diagnosis.", "type": "Document"}}
