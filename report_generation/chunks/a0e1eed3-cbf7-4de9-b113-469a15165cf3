For example, wireless antennas can be located close to densely populated urban centers, along popular travel corridors, or other areas that are economically feasible. These areas may not be remote depending on the geography and topography. However, typi- cally, renewable energy generation systems are placed in more remote areas due to space or other requirements. For instance, solar concentrators require a large area and are typically remotely located to capitalize on lower real property costs. As a further example, wind farms are primarily located based on available wind energy, and can be remote from\n\nIn various non-limiting embodiments of the disclosed sub- ject matter, systems, devices, and methodologies that facili- tate solar energy collection and use in communications sys- tems are described. For instance, in exemplary implementations, disclosed embodiments provide dual func- tion antennas that can simultaneously function as an antenna and as a solar energy collection system. For example, exem- plary embodiments can provide self-sustaining power to wireless systems employing such implementations. As a fur- ther advantage, the dual function characteristic (e.g., radiat- ing antennas for wireless communication and solar energy\n\nin\n\ndensely populated urban centers.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nother\n\nlimited\n\nbase for\n\ntems.\n\nUS 8,599,081 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 9 depicts input impedance, and FIG. 10 depicts corre\n\nfocusing or collecting) can result in cost reductions in the\n\ndesign, fabrication, and/or operation of systems employing\n\nsponding reflection coefficients;\n\nSuch implementations.\n\nFIG. 11 depicts measured antenna gain for an exemplary\n\nnon-limiting single-element SPA;\n\nAccordingly, various embodiments for Solar energy collec", "type": "Document"}}
