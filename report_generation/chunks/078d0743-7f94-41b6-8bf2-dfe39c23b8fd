The voltage output of TIDE-G was measured using an oscilloscope (Rohde&schwarzrte, RTE1024) equipped with a high-impedance (10 MQ) probe. The current and transferred charges between the ITO (source) and Al electrode (drain) were measured using oscilloscope coupled with a low-noise current preamplifier (Stanford Research System Model SR5/0) and a faraday cup connected with nanocoulomb meter (MONROE Model 284), respectively. Tne volume of water droplets was fixed at 100 HL and the as-fabricated device was at 45\u00b0 for rapid liquid detachment. To measure the variation of maximum charges Qmax transferred from source to drain as a function of the Weber number or the maximum spreading the releasing heights of droplet were varied between 1 and 20 cm. In typical measurements, relative humidity and the environment temperature were kept at approximately 40% and 20\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\ntilted\n\narea,\n\nthe\n\n\u00b0C,\n\nrespectively.\n\nMolecular Dynamics Simulations. To simulate the EDL formation process when water droplet contacting with the as-fabricated device, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out in this work. TIP4P/ICE*? water model is employed, which is a popular water model in the theoretical Studies on water. Various properties of water, e.g. melting point, density, and phase diagram etc., have been successfully reproduced by using TIP4P/ICE.
