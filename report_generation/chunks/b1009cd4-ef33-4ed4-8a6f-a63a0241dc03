A possible reason for this is that since the prediction accuracy of low motion sequence is better than that of high motion sequence, its residue is smaller and so less time is spent on the iterative table-lookup operation. FIG. 18 shows the average number of table-lookup operations for different video sequences in various QP values. The result indicates that the iterative table-lookup quantization process does not cost much time so that our proposed quantization method is practical. In addition, these experimental results are obtained using integer rounding precision in the compu- tation of the equation 22 in the JM encoder. The rate-distor- tion performance comparison of the conventional SSD and. proposed FSSD in terms of PSNR and bit-rate are shown in tables or FIGS. 19 to 22. These results show that the errors due to the clipping functions in computing the transform-domain SSD were small and the rate-distortion performance differ- ences between these two methods was less than 0.1% and 0.03 dB in terms of bit-rate and PSNR, respectively.\n\nSince the proposed FSSD computing method improved the computational efficiency of distortion measure with very little loss of rate-distortion performance, it could be com- bined with different types of H.264/AVC fast algorithms, such as fast inter/intra mode selection algorithms and rate estimation algorithm. Here, FSSD algorithm is combined with a conventional rate estimation method to reduce more computation complexity. The way to estimate the number of bits is:\n\nSimulation Results", "type": "Document"}}
