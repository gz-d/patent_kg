The data acquisition unit 106 may be an electronic device such as a computer or a portable device that is equipped with data acquisition software to collect EMG signals from the EMG electrode 102 and forward them to the processor 108 for further processing. The data acquisition unit 106 may be connected to the EMG electrodes via a wired or wireless network.\n\n[0072] The processor 108 may include one or more algo- rithms to analyze the EMG signals, and/or filter noise. In an embodiment, the EMG signals are subject to rectification, median filter, and/or root mean square amplitude for opti- mization.\n\n[0073] The determination of whether the subject is having abnormal motor movement is a real-time process. In other words, the neurostimulation system 100 can monitor the movement of the subject for a long period of time, for example for more than 5 hours, more than 10 hours or more than 15 hours, and output a stimulation signal to the neural electrode 104 within a relatively short period of time or almost instantaneously when the abnormal motor movement is detected. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a quick solution to monitor and modify the abnormal motor behavior of the subject.\n\n[0067] In an embodiment, the data acquisition unit 106 is provided by way of a portable device or a small sized electronic device which can be carried by or attached on the subject. The data acquisition unit 106 communicates with the EMG electrode 102 via a wireless network or a wired network.", "type": "Document"}}
