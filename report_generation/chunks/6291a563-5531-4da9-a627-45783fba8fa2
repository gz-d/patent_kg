It implies that the treated surfaces are mechanically stronger than the NiTi substrates underneath and can withstand mechanical shock more effectively. Among the treated surfaces, the nitrogen-implanted layer has the largest. H and E, followed by the acetylene- and oxygen-implanted layers. [0014] Table 3 lists the amounts of Ni leached from the surface-treated and untreated samples after the electrochemical tests as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Electrochemical tests based on ASTM G5-94 (1999) and G61-86 (1998) were performed by a potentiostat (VersaStat II EG&G, USA) using a standard simulated body fluid (SBF) at a pH of 7.42 and temperature of 3770.5 1 C (37.5\u00b0C). The ion concentrations in the SBF are shown in Table 4. A cyclic potential spanning between -400 and +1600mV was applied at a scanning rate of 600 mV/h. Before the electrochemical tests, the medium was purged with nitrogen for 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen and nitrogen purging continued throughout the measurements. The SBF taken from each sample after the corrosion test was analyzed for Ni and Ti employing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) (Perkin Elmer, PE SCIEX ELAN6100, USA). The amounts of Ni leached from all treated samples were significantly reduced. The magnitudes were only about 0.03 to 0.04% of that of the control samples. The ion concentrations in the SBF are shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 3 -- Amounts of Ni and Ti ions detected in SBF by ICPMS after electrochemical tests\n\nSample Ni content (ppm) Ti content (ppm)\n\nTable 4 -- Ion concentration of SBF solution", "type": "Document"}}
