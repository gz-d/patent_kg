The inventors of the present application have realized the need of an objective video quality assessment which can accurately measure the flicker distortion to assess the synthesized view video qual- ity and further optimize the compression techniques in 3D or VR video system is highly needed.\n\n[0060] FIG. 11A is a video frame of a synthesized video entitled \u201cLovebirds\u201d; FIG. 11B is a depth map of the video frame of FIG. 11A;\n\n[0061] FIG. 11C is an edge map of the depth map of F with canny threshold 0.03;\n\n[0062] FIG. 11D is an edge map of the depth map of F 11B with canny threshold 0.07;\n\n[0063] FIG. 11E is an edge map of the depth map of with canny threshold 0.1; \u672c", "type": "Document"}}
