Notably, CECE expands the material choices from limited base materials (e.g., Si and photoresist) to a broad range of engineering materials (e.g.\uff0c polymers, and other printable materials including SiO2, metal, ceramic, etc.), therefore, addresses the long-lasting challenge to bio-inspired engineering\u2014the demand of a rational combination of hierarchical structures and base material to achieve diverse properties and functions. The capability of CECE using new materials to fabricate the pre-designed hierarchical structures opens up a broad way to enable new functions of the bio-inspired materials. The inventors demonstrated two impressive examples in the inventors\u2019 work. One example is a 3D hierarchical struc- tured soft membrane mimicking the smart-skin patterns of springtails that show outstanding repellence to various liq- uids; different from previous reports, the inventors are able to make the structures on a flexible membrane with excellent mechanochemical robustness. Another example is the real- ization of flexible and anti-corrosion polymer-based liquid diodes decorated with capillary channels and mushroom structures on various plastics, even on curved surfaces, which could not be realized before due to the limitation in materials selection for conventional silicon processing. The inventors\u2019 work demonstrated the cost-effective, large-scale production of a variety of flexible, inexpensive, robust, and transparent 3D hierarchical and biomimetic materials, which was impossible to achieve before. In this way, CECE enables an unprecedented freedom in the material selection for making bio-inspired materials and the paves the road for", "type": "Document"}}
