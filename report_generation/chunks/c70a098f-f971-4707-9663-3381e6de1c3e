During the surprise recognition phase, for each scene type, participants were presented with 60 images with old foreground objects, with half of them presented in the same old background and the other half in a new background, together with the same number of lure images with new objects in a new background. Participants were presented with the images one at a time, and they judged whether they saw the foreground object during the passive viewing phase. The image stayed on the screen until response. In both phases the animal and vehicle scene images were presented in 2 separate blocks, with the block order counterbalanced across participants. Participants\u2019 eye movements were recorded using an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker, with a chinrest to minimize head movements. Each trial started with a fixation cross at the screen center. The experimenter initiated the image presentation when a stable fixation was observed at the fixation cross. An image was then presented at the screen center, spanning 35\u00b0 x 27\u00b0 of visual angle at a viewing distance of 0.6 m. Before each block, a 9-point calibration procedure was performed. Re-calibration took place whenever drift correction error exceeded\n\n1\u00b0 of visual angle.\n\nIn addition, participants performed 3 cognitive tasks to examine whether their eye movement patterns were associated with cognitive abilities:", "type": "Document"}}
