Upon photoacti- vation, the present complexes may effectively oxidize intra- cellular biomolecules such as proteins and lipids, and/or disrupt the intracellular redox hemostasis to eliminate cancer cells. By doing so, the invention herein effectively over- comes the resistance of cancer cells towards conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Since the present platinum(IV) complexes may directly oxidize intracellular biomolecules, bacteria and/or cancer cells in an oxygen-independent man- ner, they may provide improved biological activity while simultaneously-addressing the limitations of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment have to responding to conven- tional platinum drugs and photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents.\n\n[0078] Embodiments of the present invention related to the preparation of the compounds and complexes herein,\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\ntheir cytotoxicity against various tumors and/or cancer cell lines, and their antibacterial activities. An embodiment of the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one photo-activatable platinum(IV) photo-oxidant and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. It is also believed that an embodiment of the platinum(IV) complex herein may be useful as, for example, an anticancer agent, a photodynamic therapeutic agent, a photo-oxidant and a combination thereof, or an anticancer agent; a photo- dynamic therapeutic agent; or a photo-oxidant.", "type": "Document"}}
