In some implementations, the barrier con- trol component can include a sensor component that can include a sensor array (e.g., a subset of light sensors) that can detect the signal in the control region. The sensor component can be configured to face and be aligned with, or otherwise associated with, the control region of the projector screen component so that the sensor component can detect the sig- nals communicated (e.g., transmitted, emitted) from the con- trol region in relation to presentation of the visual images on the projector screen component. The barrier control compo- nent can identify the type of visual content (e.g., 2-D content, 3-D stereoscopic content, or 3-D autostereoscopic content) being presented on the projector screen component, based at least in part on the detected signal (e.g., data value associated with (e.g., represented by) the optical signal, visual pattern of\n\nAlternatively, the active parallax barrier can be synchro- nized with an electrical signal which is extracted from the video. However, to do this, it can be necessary to modify the hardware and/or software of the projection system. Further, it can be necessary to supply electrical power to the active parallax barrier through a pair of conduction wires.\n\nToday, there is no way of efficiently and effectively con- trolling the display of 3-D content and 2-D content via the same display without 2-D content appearing to be blurry and/or without a user having to manually switch the parallax barrier on and off and/or without modification of the projec- tion system.", "type": "Document"}}
