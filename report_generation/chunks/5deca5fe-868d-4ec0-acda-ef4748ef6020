Alternatively, however, the secondary winding may be electrically con- nected to the battery but physically separate therefrom. In such a case the secondary winding may be formed as part of a secondary charging module that is placed on the charging surface. This possibility is particularly useful to allow the charging platform to be used with older electronic devices that are not otherwise designed for use with such a platform.", "type": "Document"}}
