Therefore, novel methods are needed for quantitative measurements of eye movement patters that take spatial and temporal information into account and allow a more comprehensive prediction of human behavior based on eye movement patterns.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nProvided are methods and systems for the analysis and modeling of cognitive tasks involving cognitive state changes to predict subject behavior and/or cognitive processes. Specifically, provided is an Eye Movement analysis with Hidden Markov Model (EMHMM) with co-clustering and an Eye Movement analysis with Switching Hidden Markov Model (EMSHMM). The models of the invention measure differences in eye movement patterns by summarizing individuals\u2019 eye movements using hidden Markov models, allow discovery of common eye movement patterns, and provide quantitative measures of eye movement pattern similarities that take both temporal and spatial information of eye movements into account.\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n4\n\nAdvantageously, the EMSHMM of the instant invention allows data analysis and modeling for cognitive tasks involving cognitive state changes and provides better predictions and analysis of subject behavior and cognitive processes. Furthermore, the EMHMM with co- clustering allows data analysis in tasks and cognitive behaviors that involve stimuli with different layouts, including, but not limited to, website viewing, information system usage, and visual search.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
