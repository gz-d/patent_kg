The single amino acid substi- tution mutations were in the R245, N413, N419, and R654 positions and the mutants were R245A, N413A, N419A, and R654A, respectively. It was tested whether these mutants showed comparable on-target activities compared to the wild-type (WT) SaCas9 using targeted deep sequencing on three human endogenous sites, EMX1 site 6 (EMX1_6), VEGFA site 8 (VEGFA_8), and EMX1 site 1 (EMX1_1) 1a).\n\nAccordingly, the invention provides a novel and effective approach for altering the genome of a cell, for example by contacting a cell with, or expressing in the cell, a modified SaCas9 protein with a mutation at an N413 position, and\n\nThe three target sites were selected to assess both canonical NNGRRT PAM (EMX_6 and VEGFA_8 were edited at high efficiencies) and a non-canonical\n\nthe\n\na\n\nan\n\nagent\n\nan\n\na\n\nthe\n\npositions.\n\na\n\nthe\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n65\n\nbroader application.\n\nThe mutant proteins were generated\n\nthe site-specific\n\nDSBs introduced by Cas9.\n\n(FIG.\n\nof\n\nboth\n\nUS 10,975,364 B2\n\n12\n\n11\n\nNNARRT PAM ( EMX1_1 ) for which about 20 % the cleav-\n\nmodified protein was also evaluated in view of data showing\n\nage efficiency of canonical PAM in an EGFR disruption\n\nconsistently high on - target cleavage efficiency .\n\nassay was achieved but which has never been tested on a\n\nAs seen in FIG . 3B , FIG . 3C and FIG . 3F , among the six\n\nhuman endogenous target .
