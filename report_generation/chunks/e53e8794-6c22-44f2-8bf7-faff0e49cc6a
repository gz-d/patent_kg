The repeated-measures ANOVA showed that in the data, the user-defined PWM values were significantly affected by the location of the Peltier module (F(4,32)=6.07, p<0.005, 12=0.431) and the direction of temperature change (F(4,32)=6.07, p<0.005, 12=0.431). There is no interaction effect between the location of the Peltier module and the direction of temperature change. FIG. 4 shows the PWM values chosen by the participants for five points on the earhook, with the location P1 yielding the lowest average PWM value chosen by the participants. Post-hoc pairwise comparison showed that the PWM values for P5 was significantly higher than those for P1 (p<0.005), P2 (p<0.05), and P4 (p<0.05). In addition, the PWM values for the cold stimuli were significantly higher than those for the hot stimuli (p<0.0005), consistent with current research results showing humans have a lower thermal threshold for heat than for cold. Gender-wise, there was a significant difference between the PWM values chosen by the female and the male participants. Female Average: 170.15 (SD=45.\n\n74); Male Average: 196.77 (SD=43.46))\n\n[0064] Based on the pilot-study results, it 1s reasonable to assume that different users will prefer different levels thermal intensity for different spots around the auricular\n\nthe\n\nof\n\nApr. 20, 2023\n\narea.
