When the droplet fully detaches from the drain elec- trode at t,g-15.7 ms, both the current and measured charge drop to zero, reversing to the switching-off state again. In this condition, all the charges are restored back to source, making it possible to restart a new cycle. As shown in FIG. 3c, such a reversibility is further confirmed by the cyclic charge measurement. Notably, the amount of charge trans- ferred between the source and drain in each cycle is con- stant, suggesting that there is no additional charge supply from PTFE or water in this process, although the charge transfer is the", "type": "Document"}}
