The device of claim 6, wherein the laser pulses are femtosecond laser pulses.\n\n8. An electron source, comprising:\n\na device for providing electrons, including\n\nan optical fiber with a tip; and\n\na metallic arrangement arranged at the tip and arranged to be excited by an energy source to emit electrons or electron beams; and\n\nenergy source arranged to provide energy to to cause emission of electrons from the metallic arrangement.\n\n[0028] It will also be appreciated that where the methods and systems of the invention are either wholly implemented by computing system or partly implemented by computing systems then any appropriate computing system architecture may be utilized. This will include stand-alone computers, network computers, dedicated or non-dedicated hardware devices. Where the terms \u201ccomputing system\u201d and \u201ccom- puting device\u201d are used, these terms are intended to include any appropriate arrangement of computer or information processing hardware capable of implementing the function described.\n\n9. The electron source of claim 8, wherein the tip is sized micro- or nano-scale.\n\n10. The electron source of claim 8, wherein the metallic arrangement comprises a metallic surface at the tip.\n\n11. The electron source of claim 10, wherein the metallic arrangement is made from chromium, gold, or tungsten.\n\n12. The electron source of claim 8, wherein the metallic arrangement comprises a metallic coating at the tip.\n\nelectron source of claim 8, wherein the arrangement comprises a plurality of layers of metallic coating at the tip.\n\n[0029] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the inven- tion should therefore be considered in all respects as illus- trative, not restrictive.", "type": "Document"}}
