R245A, N413A, N419A, and R654A) retained comparable on-target activities in comparison to WT SaCas9, ranging from approximately 20%-60% activity across the three human endogenous sites EMX1_6, VEGFA_8, EMX1_1 as shown in FIGS. 1D-1F. At the non-canonical PAM NNARRT endogenous site EMX_1, SaCas9 modified proteins achieved 17-23% indel editing outcome.\n\nWith reference to FIG. 3F, SaCas9-HF showed significant reductions of off-target activity for EMX1_6 and the known promiscuous site VEGFA_8 in comparison to WT-SaCas9 and the R245A mutant. Nearly no off-target activity by WT-SaCas9 was detected for FANCF_10, RUNX1_13 and RUNX1_14. Unexpectedly, SaCas9-HF advantageously achieved about 8.6-, 3.2- and 0.74-fold the GUIDE-Seq reads of WT-SaCas9, respectively, for the three sites. Fur- ther, SaCas9-HF showed no cleavage at the sole off-target site when targeting RUNX1_13 by WT-SaCas9.\n\nThe inventors used an EGFP-disruption assay to evaluate SaCas9 cleavage efficiency on expressed eGFP with full- match and tiling 2-base mismatch guide sequences, as illustrated in FIG. 1G. The R245A, N419A and R654A mutants possessed similar cleavage eflicacy to the WT- SaCas9. All the SaCas9 proteins tested were highly sensitive to mismatches between guide RNA (gRNA) and the target at the PAM-proximal positions 1 to 6, relatively less sensitive at positions 7 to 18 and insensitive at positions 19 to 21. In the EGFP-disruption assay, no noticeable cleavage differ- ence was observed between WT and the R245A, N413A, N419A, and R654A SaCas9 mutants using the mismatched guides.", "type": "Document"}}
