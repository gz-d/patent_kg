The volumetric energy density (E) of the full battery was calculated by\n\nE=[oilvydtlV\u00a5\n\n[0214] After storing the AD-gel at -20\u00b0 C. or 80\u00b0 C. for one day, the mechanical properties of the AD-gel were well persevered, exhibiting impressive flexibility to endure large deformations including twisting and compressing (FIG. 8A). Once the external force is withdrawn, the AD-gel quickly recovered from the deformed shapes, showing a high resil- ience. In sharp contrast, the PAM-hydrogel electrolyte was frozen into solid at -20\u00b0 C., and dried out at 80\u00b0 C. (FIG. 8A). Correspondingly, the quantified tensile strength and compression strength of the AD-gel electrolyte display simi- lar value with subtle changes after cooling or heating, sharply contrasting with the appreciable deterioration in the mechanical properties of PAM-hydrogel electrolyte (FIGS. 8B to\n\n[0206] where I is the discharge current, Yo is the dis- charge voltage at time t, dt is time differential, and V is the total volume of the whole solid-state device, which is calculated by multiplying the surface area and the thickness of the batteries.\n\n[0207] Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical imped- ance spectroscopy (100 kHz to 0.1 Hz) were conducted by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D). The ionic con- ductivity of polymer electrolyte can be calculated by ohmic resistance, which can be obtained from the AC impedance spectra.
