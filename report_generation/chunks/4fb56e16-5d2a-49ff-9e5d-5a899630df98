The PTFE carries sufficient charges either through continuous droplet impinging or by ion-injection and there exists an electric field (4, ) within it. After that, in each cycle, at the beginning of the droplet spreading (i, II), almost no positive charges In the spreading droplet are transported to the PTFE/water interface owing to the presence of i, and hence there is no electricity generation. In contrast, when the PTFE and drain are connected by the spreading droplet (iil), the higher potential on the drain electrode over the PTFE leads to the building of an additional electric field \u00a3, within the droplet, thereby transforming the original random motion of Ions Into a directional flow, with positive and negative ions towards the PTFE surface and drain electrode, respectively. Meanwnile, because of the stronger EDL effect relative to the electrostatic interaction between PTFE and ITO, these positive charges initially bound by ITO can be released and flow toward the drain electrode (iv). When the water droplet starts to retract (v) until its separation with the drain electrode (vi), the charges on the drain electrode can flow back to ITO, transiting to the\n\nswitching-off mode again.\n\nFIG.", "type": "Document"}}
