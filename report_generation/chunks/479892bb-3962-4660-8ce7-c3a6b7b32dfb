A solder alloy composition comprising a plurality of solder particles of a Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy, in which each solder particles is less than 10 hm in diameter, and the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy comprises 12-22% of Sn, 33-43% of Bi and 45-55% of In by weight.\n\n2. The solder alloy composition of claim 1, wherein each solder particles is about 0.1 to 3 hm in diameter.\n\n3. The solder alloy composition of claim 1, wherein each solder particles is about 1 to 6 hm in diameter.\n\n4. The solder alloy composition of claim 1, wherein the Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 mm base alloy further comprises an element selected from the group consisting of Pb, Zn, and Ag.\n\n5. The solder alloy composition of claim 4, wherein the element is Pb, and the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In\u2014Pb alloy consists essentially of 11-15% Si, 35-40% Bi, 39-52% of In, and 2-6% of Pb by weight.\n\nA method for producing solder particles of a Sn \u4e00 base alloy, comprising:\n\n6. In\n\n(a) sintering a mixture comprising tin (Sn), bismuth (Bi) and indium (In) to produce a bulk alloy having melting point of about 60-65\u00b0 C.;\n\n(b)\n\ndissolving the bulk alloy of step (a) in an ethylene glycol solution containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to produce an alloy solution;\n\n(c)\n\nsubjecting the alloy solution of step (b) to ultrasoni- cation at a first temperature of about for 10 to minutes to produce a suspension; and\n\n(d) cooling the suspension of step (c) to a second tem- perature of about 0-25\u00b0 C. to produce the solder par- ticles of the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy;\n\nBi \u4e00\n\na\n\n150\n\nJan. 11, 2024\n\nwherein, each of the solder particles is less than 10 hm diameter, and the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy comprises 12-22% of Sn, 33-43% of Bi and 45-55% of In by weight.\n\nin\n\n7. The method of claim 6, wherein the Sn, Bi, and In resent in the mixture at a ratio of about bout 1:1:2 to about 1:3:5 by weight.\n\nare", "type": "Document"}}
