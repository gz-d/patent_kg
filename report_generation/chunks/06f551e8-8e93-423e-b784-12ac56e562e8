For example, the hash module is a SHAKE module 102D as described earlier arranged to perform SHA-3 related PRNG functions and sampling functions.\n\n[0106] SHAKE functions may include SHAKE128 and SHAKE256. They are extendable-output functions based on the Keccak algorithm in SHA-3 family, which take any size of input and generate any length of output. Based on the profiling results as described earlier, the Keccak function is the most time-consuming function. Hence, accelerating this function would have a significant improvement on the overall system performance.\n\n[0107] In the Dilithium algorithm, the SHAKE256 gener- ates random seeds and its outputs can be used by other operations directly. However, the SHAKE128 is used to generate numbers such as the polynomial matrix A, short vectors sl and s2 that should satisfy some specific require- ments. In this case, the outputs of the SHAKE128 need to be sampled to meet the corresponding requirements. In the software implementation, the Keccak function and the sam- plers in SHAKE are implemented separately. First, the Keccak function generates a certain number of random seeds. Then the seeds pass through the samplers for sam- pling. If the output cannot meet the requirements after sampling, the aforementioned operations need to be per- formed again. However, in the software/hardware co-design, if the Keccak function and the sampler are implemented separately, the data transmission overhead would be non- negligible. In addition, extra control logic and for\n\nspace\n\n11\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nrestoration are required. Therefore, the processor in accor- dance with these embodiments tightly combines the Keccak function and samplers into one module to save the trans- mission time and design space.", "type": "Document"}}
