The nickel titanium alloy is preferably a shape memory alloy, and has a nickel content ranging from about 20-80% of nickel and 80-20% of titanium. The surface implantation of elements enhances the mechanical properties of the alloy, such as hydrophilicity, corrosion and wear resis- tance. The nickel titanium alloy part can be reduced or enhanced. In practicing the invention, the plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition or related ion-beam and plasma-based techniques such as plasma-enhanced vapor phase deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (VPD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can reduce, terminate or prevent the deleterious ions from being released from the substrate of the shape memory materials. The mate- rials may be biomaterials used for orthopedics, urologics, vascular surgery, hepatobiliary surgery or esophageal sur- gery. The energy of the incident species used for surface treatment of the materials ranges from 1 eV to 1 keV for deposition, 500 eV to 100 keV for implantation and deposi- tion, and 500 eV to 10 MeV for beam-line ion implantation. Preferably, the energy of the surface treatment of the materi- als ranges from 1 eV to 500 eVs for deposition, 500 eVs to 1000 eVs for implantation and deposition, and 1000 to 1000 MeVs for beamline ion implantation. The direct current is applied with the parameters 0 Hz repetition with \u2018infinite\u2019", "type": "Document"}}
