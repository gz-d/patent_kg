For example, each of the subwavelength units may be selectively operable in a radiating state (that radiates electromagnetic waves) and a non-radiating state (that does not radiate electromagnetic waves). For example, each of the subwavelength units may be selectively operable in a stron- ger radiating state and a weaker radiating state. The elec- tromagnetic waves radiated by the various subwavelength units of the metasurface structure 102 may be combined in time and space to form a resultant electromagnetic wave.\n\n[0114] In some embodiments, the subwavelength units of the metasurface structure 102 may are arranged in an array, such as a 1D array or a 2D array. For example, the sub- wavelength units may be generally aligned in one or more rows and one or more columns. The subwavelength units may be spaced apart evenly or unevenly.\n\n[0115] The subwavelength units of the metasurface struc- ture 102 may have generally the same construction.
