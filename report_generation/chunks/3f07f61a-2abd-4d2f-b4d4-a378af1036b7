Agents can be small molecules in pure form or a crude extract of an herb or crude extracts of a combination of different herbs. Agents should be administrated in soluble form, with a vari- ety of carrier solvents, e.g. ethanol, DMSO. The maximum concentrations of these solvents at which no malformation is induced in zebrafish are reported (Hallare et al., 2006). For example, the level of DMSO and ethanol used in zebrafish embryo assay should be below 1.5% and 1% respectively. The agent should first be dissolved in the carrier solvent, if nec- essary. Then it is added to the embryo media containing 20 fertilized eggs or healthy embryos at desired concentration. The preferred starting time of addition is prior the onset of angiogenesis, i.e. 24 hpf. Any effect induced by the presence of administered agent will be observed after certain interval period of time, e.g., 24 hours or 48 hours or more. Egg collection, picking up fertilized eggs, and identification of healthy embryos are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (Westerfield,\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n1. Material and Methods\n\na.
