The voltage of the capacitor C, (e.g., 3.3 uF), which can be stabi- lized by the zener diode Dz,, can be the power supply for the comparators CP, and CP,. The capacitor Coe can be charged up to the desired designated voltage before the voltage of the capacitor Cy reaches a voltage level that is at a sufficiently high level for the comparators CP, and CP, to become opera- tional (e.g., to drive the comparators CP, and CP,). The out- put of comparator CP, can be provided to transistors Qio and Q),, which can be associated with resistor R49 (e.g., 10.0Q) to\n\nTurning to FIG. 3G, depicted is operation of the system 300 during the time period of time ts to time t,, at or near time ts, the voltage vz-- can drop below the defined threshold switch- ing voltage for the switch M, to switch to an on state, the switch M, can switch from an off state to an on state and can begin to conduct, and the voltage vz... can continue decreas- ing in voltage.
