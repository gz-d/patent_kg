The dose response relationship describes the change in the effects, i.e. death and malformation, caused by differing levels of concentrations of the agent. Studying dose response relationship is central to determine safe and hazardous levels for the agent under study. Dose response relationship is plotted as a graph, called dose response curve. The first point along the curve where a response, i.e. total effects inclusive death and malformation, above zero is reached is referred as the threshold concentration, or no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC). Above the threshold concentration, undesirable adverse effects, i.e.\n\n4) allow long-term study;\n\n5) be cost-effective, rapid, easy to use, reproducible; and 6) not cause any tissue damage;\n\nUp to now, none of the existing in vivo assays really meets these requirements (Hasan et al., 2004; Taraboletti and Gia- vazzi, 2004). It appears that an in vivo drug screening assay using zebrafish as model fulfill the criteria of an ideal quan- titative angiogenesis assay. An in vivo zebrafish assay has the advantages and convenience of in vitro assays (high through- put comparing to in vitro assays) and in vivo assays (being an intact organism), and thus is capable to serve as bridge or filter between in vitro screening and subsequent in vivo validation\n\nsaid\n\nPCT\n\nAngiogenesis is a physiological process of formation of\n\npursued by pharmaceutical companies all over the world.\n\nEven though there is a huge potential market for angiogen-\n\nshould:\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n(Epstein and Epstein, 2005; Goldsmith, 2004; Parng et al.,\n\ndrug discovery together with the corresponding toxicity test.", "type": "Document"}}
