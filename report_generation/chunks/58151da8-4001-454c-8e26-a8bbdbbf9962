Xi-linked GFP is silenced by multiple epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, no GFP tran- script is detected (FIG. 2/) and no fluorescent signal is observed (FIG. 9a). In contrast, when 5'-azacytosine (5-aza) is used to inhibit DNA methylation, both GFP mRNA and fluorescence signal increased significantly. In order to clarify their functional importance in XCI, TAF15 and SNF2L are depleted in the presence of 5-aza processing in the present invention (FIG. 94). Surprisingly, after silencing TAF15, the level of 5-aza-enhanced GFP is significantly reduced, which can be partially rescued by ectopic expres- sion of RNAi-resistant TAF 15 cDNA (FIG. 9c, FIG. 9d). In order to rule out the possibility that TAF15-related XCI is specific to the knocked-in GFP locus, RNA sequencing is performed in the present invention after the exhaustion of TAF15 in the female mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line under the genetic background of MAF and Cast hybrid. The allelic expression of a gene can be determined by the availability of SNPs between two different genetic back- grounds. As expected, the genes on the X chromosome show greater allelic depletion than autosomal genes (FIG. 9e), which the role of TAF15 in XCI.
