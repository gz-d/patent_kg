This may be mainly due to the misalignment between color texture and depth videos and. the depth errors induced by compression along the depth edges would easily generate the contour artifacts and neigh- borhood misplacement in synthesized views. To avoid the missed detection of the flicker area, in one embodiment, image dilation is employed to expand the detected edges width for the depth edge map E., ,, and the dilated depth edge map E,,'-{D\u00b0**(\u00aby,DIL<x=W, 1Sy<H, tek} is obtained by using a squared dilation mask.

Therefore, the temporal gradient set {G,,,} and {G,,} for the original and distorted synthe- sized videos are obtained. FIGS. 6A to 6F show a related example. In the rectangles in FIGS. 6B, 6C, 6E, and 6F, taking the video entitled \u201cUndodancer\u201d as an example, the distorted synthesized view (FIG. 6D), when compared with the original view (FIG. 6A), has more obvious black floc- culus along the motion trajectory in the gradient temporal layer. This implies that the flicker distortion corresponds to the pattern changes in gradients. In practice, the gradient map needs patch refinement to exclude noises. The random noises in the original video captured by the cameras may cause some small changes in gradients in temporal layer, which are actually not the flicker distortion. In order to reduce the influence of this noise, the patches in the temporal layer are excluded if their gradient variance is small. The", "type": "Document"}}
