For instance, 3-input LUTRAM TCAM rules.\n\nmemory plurality of pairs of lookup tables and registers combine to form a pipelining memory structure.\n\n[0052] Similarly, referring to FIGS. 3C and 3D, two 3-input LUTRAMs may be connected in parallel, e.g. with outputs being \u201cANDed\u201d (by connecting the outputs to an additional AND logic) to form 1x6 TCAM. With reference to FIG. 3D, the LUTRAMs stores \u201c1 0 X 0 1 0\u201d as one 6-input rule. The input search key (Sk) equal to \u201c10001 0\u201d and \u201c1 000 1 0\u201d matches with the stored rule to provide matchline (ML) equal to \u2018logic-1\u2019 as output.\n\n[0045] In this embodiment, the memory device is imple- mented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device which contains multiple programmable components called configurable logic blocks (CLB). Once the CLBs are pro- grammed, the FPGA may logically process electronic inputs and provide corresponding logic output as required. For example, the FPGA may utilize the programmed lookup tables in the device to process the input to determine the output, and provides the output logic as desired.\n\n[0053] Four 3-input LUTRAMs are connected such that two LUTRAMs in parallel and two in cascade form emulate a 2x6 TCAM. In FIG. 3E two TCAM rules of 6 bits each (\u201c1 00 X 1 0\u201d and \u201c1 X X 00 1\u201d) are stored.\n\n[0046] The following table lists the important terminolo- used in the memory device according to embodiments the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
