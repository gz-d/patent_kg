The MD system includes 40000 water molecules with 808 Na and 808 CI being dissolved in water. To mimic the experimental setup, rigid and smooth hydrophobic atomic layers are used to represent the PTFE and electrode, respectively. 800 negative and 800 positive charges were fixed with spacing of 8.7 A, respectively, on the atomic layers of PTFE and electrode, and each site was charged +e, as depicted in Extended Data Fig. 14. Water molecules with dissolved Na and Cl ions were initially equilibrated for 3 ns of MD simulations at 300 K without any charge on the substrates. Then, 5ns MD simulations in the NV7 ensemble at 300 K were carried out. The box size of the model is 17.8 nm x 17.3 nm x 31.4 nm. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the x and y direction. The parameters for Na* and Cl were taken from previous studies*\u201d (Ona=2.876 A, \u20acna=0.5216 kJ/mol, oci=3.785 A\uff0cgc=0.5216 kJ/mol). The cross LJ interaction parameters between water and sodium and chlorine ions were given by Lorentz-Berthelot rule. The interactions between substrate atoms and NaCl water solution were described by 12-6 LJ potential (ONa-sub=3.021 A, ENa-sub=0.4785 kJ/mol, Ocisub=3.476 A, Eci-sup=0.4785 kJ/mol, oo.sub=3.458 A, Eo. sub=0.6223 kJ/mol). Fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald method was used for electrostatic interactions with a real-space cutoff 10 A. The van der Waals interactions were truncated at 10 A. Newton's equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 1 fs by leap-frog algorithm in the MD simulations. Nos\u00e9 -Hoover scheme was used to control constant temperature of the systems.\n\nAll the MD simulations were carried out by using Gromacs 4.5.5 software.\n\nThe present invention is further elaborated as follows.\n\nThe effect of continuous droplet impinging on electricity generation", "type": "Document"}}
