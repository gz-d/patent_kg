The interactive wearable device adopts electric field sensing technology due to its potentially high sensitiv- ity to detect a movement event caused by two fingers of an wearer. The detector of the interactive wearable device includes three electrode layers, which are, a receiving elec- trode layer, a transmitting electrode layer, and a ground electrode layer. Each of the electrode layers is arranged along a corresponding curved path. Thus, when a wearer wears the detector through his/her finger, the shape of the electrode layer can better fit the shape of the finger, which is advantageous to improve signal accuracy in response to\n\nthe movement event. Also, the interactive wearable device is trained to by at\n\nleast two ML based methods for recognizing known one or more microgestures and continuous 1D tracking of the thumb\u2019s position on the index finger, respectively. In some embodiments, steps of performing channel-wise gradient operation and temporal gradient operation are applied to a training method of a first ML model related to recognize known one or more microgestures, so as to obtain fina\u2019 feature sets for training the first ML model. In some embodi- ments, steps of performing sliding window operation an channel-wise gradient operation are applied to a training method of a second ML model related to continuous 1D tracking of the thumb\u2019s position on the index finger, so as to obtain final feature sets for training the second ML model. Thus, the interactive wearable device adopting the first and second ML models shows an excellent accuracy in recog- nizing known microgestures or tracking 1D tracking of the\n\nthumb\u2019s position.", "type": "Document"}}
