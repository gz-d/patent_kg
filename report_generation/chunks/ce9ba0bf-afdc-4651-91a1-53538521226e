The synchronous rectifier device of claim 18, wherein the subset of power switches is further configured to comprise a first high-side power switch, at least one other high-side power switch, a first low-side power switch, and at least one other low-side power switch that are arranged in a circuit to maintain the first high-side power switch, the at least one other high-side power switch, the first low-side power switch, and the at least one other low-side power switch in an off state, during a period of time that the SDGD subsystem is not operating in the steady state, to facilitate function of the subset of power switches as a diode bridge in order to facili- tate rectification of the input power signal to generate the rectified power signal, and wherein the first power switch is the first high-side power switch and the second power switch is the first low-side power switch, and, with respect to the first switch, the first switch state is the off state. 15 20 25\n\n30\n\neR OR Oe OF\n\npower\n\n10", "type": "Document"}}
