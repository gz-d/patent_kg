In some embodiments, one SHMM per individual is trained to summarize an individual\u2019s eye movement behavior during a task. In some embodiments, two or more SHMMs are trained using data from two different participant selections.\n\nIn preferred embodiments, individual SHMMs according to their similarities are clustered to discover common eye movement patterns in a task. Different eye movement patterns are associated with different decision-making behavior and can be detected and measured with the methods and systems of the instant invention. Thus, the methods of the instant invention can be used to infer, e.g., a decision making behavior from eye movement patterns.", "type": "Document"}}
