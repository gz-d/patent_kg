The red, blue, and green stars on the top indicate the time points at which the gaze cascade effect occurred; the black stars on the bottom indicate the time points during which the two groups had significant differences ln the proportion of time spent on the chosen item.\n\nFIGURES 8A-B show the differences in transitions between exploration and preference-biased periods between two participant groups. FIGURE 8A shows the average probability of the two groups being in the preference-biased period throughout a trial. FIGURE 8B shows the probability distribution of the number of fixations in the exploration period (top) and the number of fixations in the preference-biased period (bottom).\n\nFIGURES 9A-B show the average inference accuracies of the two participant groups. FIGURE 9A shows the average inference accuracies using partial fixations in a trial, selected as a percentage of each trial\u2019s duration from the beginning. FIGURE 9B shows the average inference accuracies of the two participant groups using different window lengths starting from the beginning of the trial.", "type": "Document"}}
