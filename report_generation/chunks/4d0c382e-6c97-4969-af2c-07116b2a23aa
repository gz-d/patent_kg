An energy receiving element adapted to be fixed to a battery pack to enable said battery pack to be charged from a planar inductive battery charging system, said energy receiv- ing element comprising an AC capacitor, wherein said energy receiving element has an inductance and forms a resonant tank with the AC capacitor, and wherein said energy receiving element comprises a generally planar thin soft magnetic sheet and a first coil wound circumferentially around the edge of said sheet such that the coil lies in a plane defined by said magnetic sheet.\n\n27. An energy receiving element as claimed in claim further comprising a capacitor connected in series with said first coil and forming a resonant tank with said first coil and said magnetic sheet.\n\n28. An energy receiving element as claimed in claim 26 further comprising a diode rectifier and a DC capacitor con- nected to the first coil to provide a rectified DC voltage that can be fed from the energy receiving element to a battery charging circuit of said battery pack.\n\n20. An energy receiving element as claimed in claim 19 further comprising a second coil formed as a spiral in a plane parallel to said soft magnetic sheet and wherein said second coil is connected in parallel with said first coil.\n\n21. An energy receiving element as claimed in claim wherein said second coil is formed on a printed circuit board.\n\n29. An energy receiving element as c wherein said diode rectifier is a voltage doubler. aimed in claim 28", "type": "Document"}}
