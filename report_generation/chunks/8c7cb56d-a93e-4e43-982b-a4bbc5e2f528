The method 1300 can be imple- mented by a barrier component, in response to receiving a control signal from a barrier control component, to facilitate controlling switching or selecting of a particular display mode of the plurality of available display modes to facilitate desirable display of video content by the projector screen component in conjunction with the barrier component.\n\nAt 1302, a control signal can be received. The barrier component can receive the control signal from the barrier control component in relation to controlling switching or selecting a barrier pattern mode (and/or corresponding barrier pattern) that can correspond to the control signal to facilitate processing video content being presented by the barrier com- ponent, in conjunction with the projector screen component, to a viewer(s).\n\nAt 1304, a barrier pattern mode (and/or corresponding barrier pattern), of a plurality of available barrier pattern modes (and/or corresponding available barrier patterns), can be identified (e.g., automatically or dynamically, in real time) based at least in part on the received control signal. In an aspect, the barrier component can analyze the control signal, and based at least in part on the information contained in the control signal, the barrier component can identify and select", "type": "Document"}}
