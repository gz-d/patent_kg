In the probe design, the N-terminal Gln residue was replaced by a photo-cross-linker. To syn- thesize KPlip, the peptide was first assembled by the stan- dard Fmoe solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) method. The Mtt group in the peptide was then deprotected to allow the installation of a lipoyl group. Subsequently a photo- cross-linker with diazirine was introduced to the peptide. The synthesis is shown in FIG. 2. KPlip was further purified by HPLC and characterized by LC-MS. For comparison study, a control probe, KPlip-C, without the lipoyl moiety\n\n[0063] FIG. 6 shows the fluorescence measurements of fluorescent probe of the invention against a range of pro- teins.\n\n[0064] FIG. 7 shows the relative levels of PDH activity overexpressing Sirt2 compared to wild-type cells\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION", "type": "Document"}}
