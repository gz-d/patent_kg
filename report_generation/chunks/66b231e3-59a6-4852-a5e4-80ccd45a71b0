A single-phase or multi-phase synchro- nous rectifier can comprise at least a first pair of switches of a first conducting path and a second pair of switches of a second conducting path that can form or emulate a diode bridge. To facilitate emulating turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, a switch can be turned on when voltage across the switch is forward-biased and turned off when switch current is reversed; also, there can be at least one current-controlled switch in each conducting path. Self-driven gate-drive cir- cuitry employs low power components that can facilitate controlling respective switching of the at least first pair and second pair of switches, wherein switching of the switches is also controlled at to emulate diode\n\n(51) Int.
