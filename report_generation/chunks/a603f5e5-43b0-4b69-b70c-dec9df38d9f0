Preferably, for example, the evaporating and supply means comprises an evaporation chamber for receiving a source of said implantation material, and a heating means for generat- ing vaporized implantation material from the source. The heating means preferably surrounds the evaporation chamber.\n\nThis application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/891,309, filed Jul. 14, 2004. The entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates to an apparatus and method for Plasma-Based Ion Implantation (PBID), and in particular though not exclusively to such a method that is suitable for use with implantation materials that have a low melting point and high vapor pressure.", "type": "Document"}}
