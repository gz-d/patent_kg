It is typically used as a\n\nUS 8,264,270 B2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nshunt element to attenuate undesirable signals. However, equivalent series inductance (ESL) and equivalent series resistance (ESR) significantly affect the capacitor\u2019s high fre- quency (HF) performance, causing non-ideal filter behavior.\n\nACTIVE CANCELLATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE PARASITIC ELEMENTS IN CAPACITORS\n\nFIG. 1 shows the schematic representation of a prior art high-frequency model for a capacitor 10. The capacitor 10 behaves like an inductor when the operating frequency is higher than the damped resonance frequency of the capacitor 10. The damped resonance frequency is determined by the capacitance of the capacitor, its ESL 12, andits ESR 14. FIG. 2 shows an impedance against operating frequency curve 20 fora 470 pF electrolytic capacitor, in which its ESL is 147 nH and its ESR is 67 mQ. The damped resonance frequency fof the capacitor 10 coincides with the minimum value of imped- ance as illustrated in FIG. 2. The capacitor impedance is dominated by the ESL at high frequencies and its impedance increases with the operating frequency.\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThis application contains subject matter which is related to the subject matter of the following applications, each of which is assigned to the same assignee as this application and filed on the same day as this application.
