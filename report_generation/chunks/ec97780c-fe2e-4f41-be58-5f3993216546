The transistors may each respectively be arranged (e.g., controlled) to selectively operate in and transit between/among an active region, a cut-off region, and a triode region for facilitating generation of the third harmonic power.\n\n[0149] In this embodiment, the gate terminals of the transistors are electrically connected with each other directly, and the source terminals of the two transistors electrically connected with each other directly.\n\ntwo\n\nare\n\n[0150] In this embodiment, the two transistors of transistor arrangement 402A are further connected with various circuit arrangements.\n\nthe\n\n[0151] First, the source terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) is electrically connected with a capacitive arrangement for facilitating oscillation and a transmission line arrangement for power supply. The transmission line arrangement is arranged electrically in parallel with the capacitive arrangement. In this embodi- ment, the capacitive arrangement includes a grounded capacitor and the transmission line arrangement includes a curved (wavy) transmission line with multiple turns via\n\ngrounded\n\na capacitor.\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\n[0152] Second, the source terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) is electrically connected with a capacitive arrangement for facilitating oscillation and a transmission line arrangement for power supply. The transmission line arrangement is arranged elec- trically in parallel with the capacitive arrangement. In this embodiment, the capacitive arrangement includes a grounded capacitor and the transmission line arrangement includes a curved (wavy) transmission line with multiple turns grounded via a capacitor.", "type": "Document"}}
