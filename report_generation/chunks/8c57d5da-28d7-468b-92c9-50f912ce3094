The probes of the present invention provide useful tools to further advance the understanding of lipoylation and other acylation in biology and diseases.\n\n[0093] General Information.\n\nSirtuins, including Sirtl, Sirt2, Sirt3, SirtS, and Sirt6, were recombinantly expressed and purified. Pyruvate dehydroge- nase E2 (DLAT) (NM_001931) human recombinant protein was sourced from ORIGENE. Streptavidin magnetic beads were purchased from New England Biolabs. In-gel fluores- cence scanning experiments were performed with a FLA- 9000 Fujifilm scanner. Antibody of Sirt2 (D4S6J) was from Cell Signaling. Antibodies of DLAT (ab172617), lipoic acid (ab58724), HDAC8 (ab187139), BRMSIL (ab107171), and Hsp60 (ab128567) were from Abeam. IRDye 680RD don- key anti-rabbit IgG (secondary antibody) was purchased from LI-COR Biosciences. Immobilon-FL poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane for Western blotting was purchased from Merck Millipore. Western blotting was carried out with a C600 Azure biosystem. Sirt2 siRNA (AM16708) was from ThermoFisher Scientific. The plasmid pCMV4a-SIRT2-Flag was purchased from Addgene (plasmid #102623).20 The sequencing grade modified trypsin was purchased from\n\n[0089] These results indicated that Sirt2 has delipoylation activity toward DLAT protein.\n\nExample 8\u2014Sirt2 Delipoylation of PDH in Living Cells", "type": "Document"}}
