Choi et al uses one planar winding as a pri- mary charging pad and a separate planar winding as a secondary winding as shown in Figs. 4A and 4B. Fig.5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit diagram of this con- tactless charging system. As explained in Choi et al, the circuit operation of the coreless PCB transformer is based on the theory proposed by Hui et al. It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described in Hui et al, while the front power stage of the secondary circuit is a standard winding with a diode rectifier that provides the rectified DC voltage for the charging circuit. [0010] Two main problems suffered by the charging system of Fig.5 proposed by Choi et al include: (1) The planar winding of the secondary module must be placed directly on top of the planar winding of the primary unit. If it is slightly misplaced, the energy transfer will be seri- ously hampered. (2) The use of one spiral planar winding in the secondary module to pick up energy emitted from the primary winding requires the choice of switching fre- quency to be very high. In Choi et al, the operating fre- quency has to be 950 kHz. Such high switching frequency leads to high switching loss in the primary inverter circuit, high AC resistance in the PCB copper tracks and more importantly high electromagnetic interference (EMI) emission. [0011] Problem (1) can be solved by using a planar inductive charging platform based on a multi-layer planar winding array structure, which allows the charged elec- tronic equipment to be placed anywhere on the charging surface as described in GB2389720A. However requiring a multi-layer charging platform increases the complexity of the charging platform undesirably. [0012] A planar inductive battery charging platform that generates magnetic field with lines of flux flowing per- pendicular to the planar surface (Fig.2) can be construct- ed in two ways.
