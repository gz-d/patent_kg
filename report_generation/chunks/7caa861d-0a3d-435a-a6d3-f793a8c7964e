Bonding with Cu Substrates\n\nSn\u2014Bi\u2014In base\n\nIn this example, whether the\n\n[0081]\n\nsolder particles of the present disclosure capable of effec- tively bonding with a copper substrate was investigated. To this purpose, the flux added with and without 50 mg of the present Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles were respectively placed on the Cu sheet, then a sandwiched Cu/solder par- ticles/Cu structure was produced under a bonding pressure of MPa at room temperature for 5 minutes in accordance with procedure set forth in \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section. Microstructures of Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 Inbase solder particle-bond Cu substrate were examined by SEM, which are provided in FIGS. 3 and 4. The shear strength of solder joints was evaluated with bulk solder solder\n\nby reflowing\n\nor\n\nparticles.\n\n[0082] Interfacial interaction was found on the interface tween Cu substrate and the present Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder particles. As revealed in the SEM photographs in panels (a) and (b) of FIG. 3, the microstructure revealed the formation of Cu,Sn, intermetallic compound (IMC) on the surface of Cu under 20 MPa pressure for 5 minutes (as denoted by boxes). Further, the microstructure formed after the reaction between submicron Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder articles and Cu substrate is provided in FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, a dense and uniformly distributed network struc- ture was formed between the interface of Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles and Cu substrate. This network-like micro- structure may be beneficial in improving the mechanical of the solder\n\nproperties\n\njoints.", "type": "Document"}}
