The actuation means for the electromagnetic device 704 is not shown.\n\n[0074] As illustrated, the system 700 includes a magnetic frame. The magnetic frame includes a top base 792, a bottom base 794, and a plurality of magnetic bridges bridging the top base 792 and the bottom base 794. The magnetic frame includes or is made of one or more magnetic materials. The magnetic frame contributes to improved system perfor- mance because of the enhanced overall magnetic field strength and gradient generation in the workspace.\n\n[0075] As illustrated, the system 700 is configured as a cage structure, which is compact and effective to confine magnetic field within the workspace, thereby beneficial to driving of actuation subject. System configuration other than cage structure may be possible in some other embodiments.\n\n[0076] FIG. 8 shows magnetic flux density (also called magnetic B-field strength) vs distance relationship in workspace generated by a single electromagnetic device according to certain embodiments of the present invention.\n\n[0077] The electromagnetic device may be one of the electromagnetic devices as stated above with reference to one or more figures. The relationship, i.e. the curve 800, may be obtained by simulation using a proper software, such as Ansys Electronic Desktop 2017 in the present embodiment. In the present embodiment, finite element analysis is used, despite other methods may be employed in some other embodiments.\n\n[0078] In the present embodiment, the electromagnetic actuation system takes the electromagnetic actuation system 700 with reference to FIG. 7, which includes eight electro- magnetic devices.
