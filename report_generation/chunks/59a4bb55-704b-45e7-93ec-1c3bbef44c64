As shown in FIG. 6, the parasitic voltages across capacitor 110 associated with its ESL L112 and ESR r,.114 are v, and Vz, respectively. The magnitudes of v, and v, are equal to\n\nThe two voltage sources can, however, be implemented together to compensate for both series parasitic inductance and resistance of a component or part of a circuit or system exhibiting capacitance. In this embodiment, only a single voltage follower 420, as shown in FIG. 9, is provided. The input of the voltage follower 420 is the sum of the differen- tiator circuit 200 and the multiplier circuit 300.\n\nmagnitude of v, ,+v,,2 is in the order of a few tenth the required power rating of the voltage follower even if the capacitor current is large.\n\nvr=rcic\n\nIn an electronic circuit or system, the effects of L. 112 and t\u00a2114 can be canceled by using two auxiliary voltage sources vol 116 and v,, 118 connected in series with the capacitor 100. v,, and v, are equal in magnitude and phase opposition.
