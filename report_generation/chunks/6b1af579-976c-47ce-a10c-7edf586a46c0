FTIR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FTIR Spectrometer. As shown in FIG. 3, the disappearance of the \u2014S\u2014H bonds (~2500 cm 1) of BHT in BHT-BQ- COF indicates the fully conversion of the precursors after the coupling reaction. The appearance of the \u2014C\u2014S bonds (703 cm\u2122 and 664 cm\u2122') and =\u2014C\u2014S\u2014C bonds (1233 cm\u2122 and 1028 em\u2122') of BHT-BQ-COF indicates the for- mation of the dithioether linkage, which are in accordance with the peaks of the model compound at 705 cm 1, 658\n\nem\u201d, 1243 cm\u2122, and 1030 cm\u2019, respectively.\n\n[0074] The thermal stability of BHT-BQ-COF was mea- sured on a PerkinElmer STA 6000 using ceramic pan as the container. As shown by the thermogravimetric analysis in FIG. 4, more than 90% of the initial weight can be remained. when the temperature reaches 230\u00b0 C. The apparent drop before 100\u00b0 C. can be ascribed to the moisture adsorbed by BHT-BQ-COF. This demonstrates the good thermal stability of BHT-BQ-COF.\n\nExample 4\n\nFabrication of a BHT-BQ-COF-Based Cathode\n\n[0075] BHT-BQ-COF, Ketjen Black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with a mass ratio of 5:4:1 to form a slurry. The obtained slurry was pasted onto an Al foil and dried at 80\u00b0 for 12 h in a vacuum oven.\n\nC.\n\nExample 5\n\nFabrication of a Half SIB Coin Cell with the BHT-BQ-COF-Based Cathode", "type": "Document"}}
