However, for exist- ing absorption-based thermochemical energy storage sys- tems, there are two major issues to be addressed for wider applications: reducing reactor size to improve energy stor- age density, and lowering the charging temperature to utilize low-grade thermal energy that otherwise is unusable. The widely-used immersed and falling-film reactors have limited absorption rates and separated solution/refrigerant flows, which significantly constrain the energy storage perfor- mance.\n\nvia\n\nMar. 9, 2023\n\n[0010] \u2018Therefore, there is a growing need to develop novel reactors to maximize energy density, lower the charging temperature, increase energy efficiency, and reduce capital cost.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
