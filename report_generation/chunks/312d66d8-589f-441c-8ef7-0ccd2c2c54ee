If the inductance L is increased from 1H to 2H (FIG. 12), the simulated LED voltage and current waveforms are plotted in FIG. 13(a). The correspond- ing total LED power and individual LED power are included. in FIG, 13(d).\n\nOne possible issue, however, is that the abovedescribed circuits assume a reasonably constant input voltage which may not necessarily be true. In countries where the AC mains supply is unreliable or in any other situation where there may be AC mains voltage fluctuation for whatever reason, there could be a significant variation in the LED power for a given nominal AC input voltage. In preferred embodiments of the invention therefore it may be preferable to provide a means for controlling the power sensitivity of the load against AC voltage fluctuation.\n\nIt can be seen that, with L increased to 2H, the power variation (from 1.6 W to 2.5 W) is 36%. If the same power variation is applied to the two examples in reference Hui et al [Hui S. Y. R. and Qin Y. X., \u201cGeneral photo-electro-thermal theory for light-emitting diodes (LED) systems\u201d, [EEE Applied Power Electronics Conference, February 2009, Washington D.C., USA, paper 16.2], FIG. 13(c) and FIG. 13(d) show that the variation in the luminous flux is approxi- mately 7% and 12%, respectively. It is envisaged that human eyes are not sensitive to such small changes of luminous flux variation.", "type": "Document"}}
