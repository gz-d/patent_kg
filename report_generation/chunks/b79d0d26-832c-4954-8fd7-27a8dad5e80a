These example embodiments can be considered as more specific implementations of the designs associated with FIGS. 25 to 27.\n\n[0127] In some embodiments, there is provided a patch- antenna-based 2D array, e.g., oscillator array or coupled oscillator array. In some embodiments, the patch-antenna- based 2D array includes a synchronization network with an operation mode that can support differential excitation of the patch antenna arrangement of the patch-antenna-based 2D array, for improved area efficiency. In some embodiments, there is provided a coupled oscillator array for high coherent radiation power and lensless effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). In some embodiments, there is provided a high-efficiency and beam-steerable coupled oscillator-radia- tor array, integrated with a patch antenna arrangement for front-side radiation.\n\n[0128] In some embodiments, there is provided a 2D synchronization network for an oscillator-and-patch-an- tenna-based radiator. The oscillator-and-patch-antenna- based radiator may include multiple oscillators (e.g., -gm cells) arranged in a 2D array, i.e., in multiple rows each with multiple oscillators and multiple columns each with multiple oscillators, and the 2D synchronization network may be arranged to couple the oscillators. The oscillator-and-patch- antenna-based radiator may also include a patch antenna arrangement operably coupled with the oscillators. The patch antenna arrangement may include patch antennas each differentially fed by two adjacent coupled oscillators. In some embodiments, the 2D synchronization network can sustain an out-of-phase coupling mode for adjacent coupled oscillators and an in-phase coupling mode for adjacent coupled oscillators in the same column for different col-\n\numns.", "type": "Document"}}
