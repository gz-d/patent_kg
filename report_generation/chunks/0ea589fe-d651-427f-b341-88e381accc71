It should be noted that some voltage regulators are also commonly referred to as DC (Direct current) to DC converters and, as such, the term \u2018voltage regulator\u2019 as used herein is considered to also comprise a DC to DC converter. Furthermore, the present invention is equally applicable to current regulators and to voltage and current regulators hav- ing an AC output circuit.\n\nAccording to yet a further main aspect of the invention, there is provided a switched mode power supply having regulator according to the second main aspect of the inven- tion.\n\nAccording to yet a further main aspect of the invention, there is provided an electronic device having at least one regulator according to the second main aspect of the inven- tion.\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates the basic concept of an output compen- sation method in accordance with the invention applied to an output signal ofa first example of a regulator according to the invention, said regulator comprising a voltage regulator in this example.
