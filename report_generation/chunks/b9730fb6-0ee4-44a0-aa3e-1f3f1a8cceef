As shown in FIG. 18, the temperature was increased to 80\u00b0 C. after first 5 cycles, the specific capacity of the PAM-battery deteriorated significantly with large voltage polarization. The performance degradation possibly resulted from the dehydration of hydrogel electrolyte at higher temperature (insert of FIG. 18). For the AD-battery, the energy-storage ability at 80\u00b0 C. was almost the same as that prior to heating, and the specific capacity remained stable for the proceeding cycling, demonstrating the superior anti- heating property of the AD-battery (FIG. 18).\n\n[0229] The corresponding charge-discharge curves at vari- ous current densities exhibited characteristic plateaus with relatively small voltage hysteresis, demonstrating the sig- nificant structural adaptability of the AD-battery upon deliv- ering capacities at various currents (FIG. 15E).\n\n[0230] temperature on trochemical performance of the battery 1400 was investi- gated by simulating the actual harsh conditions. The elec- trochemical properties of the battery were examined while the battery was operating inside a thermostat over the temperature ranged from -20\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C. The CV curves of the AD-battery were recorded for several minutes at -20, 25, 60, and 80\u00b0 C. As shown in FIG. 16A, all the CV curves exhibited distinguished reduction/oxidation peaks with neg- ligible voltage polarization at the scan rate of 1 mV s*\u2019 , indicating an ideal reaction reversibility. The intensity of peaks afier cooling or heating appears to increase slightly due to the integrity of the porous structure of the electrolyte at low temperature as discussed above as well as faster ion transport at high", "type": "Document"}}
