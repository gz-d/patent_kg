Some power MOSFETs can have an on-state resistance, R,,,, as low as 40 mQ. For current of 10 A, the conduction loss is PR,,=4 W. This is a reduction from the power loss (e.g., 6 W power savings) when compared to a power diode. However, the conventional synchronous rectifiers suffer from a number of significant drawbacks, including, for example, requiring a customized charge pump circuit in order to provide a suitable DC power supply for a gate drive, only being suitable for low-voltage and high-frequency (>100 kHz) applications, but not mains voltage and mains frequency operations, requiring logic cir- cuits that have to be tailor-made to cater for a particular application. For the synchronous rectifier proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,425 for mains voltage and main frequency operation, complicated timing circuits are needed to check the switching times for the MOSFETs in order to differentiate different types of loads. It is desirable to be able to provide self-driven AC-DC synchronous rectification technique that can be used to develop an AC-DC synchronous rectifier that can behave like a diode bridge and be used in high-voltage power applications, but with significantly reduced conduc- tion losses and without requiring control integrated circuits.
