The method of claim 27, wherein microstrip antenna further comprises: orming\n\n10. The filter-antenna of claim 9, wherein the patch includes a central portion, and the defected microstrip struc- ture comprises one or more slots arranged in the central portion of the patch.\n\norming a defected microstrip structure in the microstrip network.\n\n29. The method of claim 28, wherein microstrip antenna further comprises: orming\n\n10, portion of the patch includes one or more open stubs each associated with a respective slot.\n\norming a defected ground structure on a ground plane a second, opposite face of the microstrip antenna.\n\n12. The filter-antenna of claim 11, wherein the patch further includes a first side portion connected with and arranged a first side of the central portion and a second side portion connected with and arranged at a second, opposite side of the central portion, and wherein each of the first and second side portions includes one or more stubs.\n\n30. The method of claim 29, wherein integrating absorptive filter comprises:\n\n\u2018orming a hole in the substrate for receiving a filter element of the absorptive filter.\n\n31. The method of claim 30, wherein integrating the absorptive filter further comprises:\n\n13. The filter-antenna of claim 9, wherein the patch is symmetric about an axis of symmetry.\n\narranging the filter element of the absorptive filter in the hole.\n\n14. The filter-antenna of claim 11, wherein the defected ground structure comprises one or more slots arranged in plane.\n\n32. The method of claim 31, wherein arranging the filter element of the absorptive filter in the hole comprises arrang- ing the filter element of the absorptive filter substantially completely in the hole.\n\n15. The filter-antenna of claim 14, wherein the defected ground structure comprises a central slot corresponding central portion of the patch.", "type": "Document"}}
