As compared with previous approaches, the EMSHMM method of the invention is unexpectedly superior at capturing eye movement behavior in the task and infers participants\u2019 decision responses with higher accuracy. In addition, EMSHMM provides quantitative measures of similarities among individual eye movement patterns, and thus is particularly suitable for studies using eye movements to examine individual differences in cognitive processes, making a significant impact on the use of eye tracking to study cognitive behavior across\n\ndisciplines.\n\nIt should be understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for\n\nillustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and the scope of the appended claims.
