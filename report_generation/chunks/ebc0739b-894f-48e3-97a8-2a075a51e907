In the depicted ThermEar- hook, as an example, 10x6 mm thermoelectric modules (1.e.\uff0c Peltier modules) are employed with a thickness of 1.4 mm (Model No.: TES1-03103), as shown in FIG. 2. The thermo- electric element includes a matrix of micro Peltier elements with a metallized surface. The modules are selected because of their thinness, light weight, and a manufacturing process that offers a high thermal efliciency (maximum refrigerating\n\ncapacity Qmax=7.51) even without a heat sink.\n\n[0054] The exemplary earhook frame of FIGS. 1A-1B is 3D printed with PLA (Polylactic Acid) having a thickness of 1.2 mm. The sizing was selected to allow slight flexibility to fit the uneven surface around the back of the ear. The miniature size of the thermoelectric module also facilitates the fitting of the ThermEarhook on the skin around the auricular area.\n\n[0055]\n\nThe setup of ThermEarhook is as shown in FIGS.", "type": "Document"}}
