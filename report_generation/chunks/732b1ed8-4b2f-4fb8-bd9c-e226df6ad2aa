The sensor component can include a sensor array comprising a subset of sensors that can sense or detect the optical signals. In some implementations, the sub- set of sensors can be a subset of solar cells that can detect the optical signal, and can convert the light energy of the optical signal into electrical energy, for example, via a photovoltaic effect process or indirectly by first converting the light energy into heat energy and converting the heat energy to electrical energy.\n\nAt 1308, processed video content, comprising the gener- ated or reconstructed scene (e.g., 2-D scene or 3-D scene), can be presented. For example, the barrier component can present the processed video content comprising the generated or reconstructed scene as an output, which can be viewed by a viewer.\n\nAt 1208, the electrical energy can be provided, for example, to a power supply component. The sensor compo- nent can provide the electrical energy (e.g., electrical power) to the power supply component of the barrier control compo- nent. The power supply component can store the electrical energy in a battery component and/or can provide some or all of the electrical energy to other components of the barrier control component or to other components (e.g., barrier com- ponent, projector screen component) to facilitate powering one or more components associated with the barrier control component.", "type": "Document"}}
