For the avoidance of doubt, the subject matter disclosed herein is not limited by such examples. In addition, any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs, nor is it meant to preclude equivalent exemplary structures and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms \u201cincludes,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d \u201ccontains,\u201d and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims, for the avoidance of doubt, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements.\n\nFIG. 28 depicts exemplary output voltages 2802 of the one or more solar cell panels 302 for an exemplary non-limiting GA 300 as a function of illumination angle (6) 2804. For instance, FIG. 28 depicts output voltages 2802 of the one or more solar cell panels 302 for 0,=0\u00b0 in a flat ground plane configuration 2806 and the one or more solar cell panels 302 for 0,=5\u00b0 in a V-shaped concave ground plane configuration 2808, with H=41 cm, as described above. It can be observed from FIG. 28 that when 0<18\u00b0, a larger output voltage is obtained using the V-shaped ground plane 2808 due, in part, to its focusing effect. When the light 2710 is incident nor- mally (8=0\u00b0), the output voltages are 3.77 Volts (V) and 0.70 V for the V-shaped 2808 and flat ground plane 2806 cases, respectively. For comparison (not shown), it is noted that that an output voltage of 2.61 V can be generated when the one or more solar cell panels 302 are illuminated by the light source 2706 directly (e.g. without parabolic optical dish 2708) at an equivalent total path length as when using the parabolic opti- cal dish 2708.", "type": "Document"}}
