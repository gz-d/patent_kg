For example, when a mobile client device downloads data packets from a remote server, the data packets may be transmitted through wired network, in form of bits of voltage logic, from the remote server to a base station in a cellular network, and then wirelessly transmitted to the mobile device in form of electromagnetic signals.\n\n[0014] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the delay element includes an analogue delay element.\n\n[0015] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the analogue element includes an analogue delay-line.\n\n[0016] an aspect, analogue delay-line includes a plurality of printed circuit board traces connected with each or the sub-channels.\n\n[0003] Beside conversion of form of signals which may occur, when data are transmitted from a source device to a destination device through different network means, data may also be converted between analogue and digital for- mats. For example, digital bits may be modulated into analogue signals which may be more easily transmitted in wireless network, however, the analogue signals are to be further converted back to digital form when reaching the receiver end for further processing.\n\n[0017] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the analogue delay-line includes a plurality of signal traces on dielectric material connected with each of the sub-channels.\n\n[0018] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the delay element is provided in the output stage of the transmitter", "type": "Document"}}
