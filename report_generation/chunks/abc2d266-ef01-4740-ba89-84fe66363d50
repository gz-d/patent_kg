This embodiment of a DR 116 is mounted on a circuit 110 of an electronic device or system (not shown) and comprises a focusing transparent DR 116 which is shaped to focus light impinging on its upper surface and to convey the focused light to a selected region on a lower surface thereof adjacent an underlaid solar cell. The selected region may be chosen as a region that maps to or overlaps a light receiving part of the solar cell 114 when the DR 116 is mounted on the circuit 110 above the solar cell 114.\n\nA square solar cell was used. The solar cell was assumed to have dielectric properties having the values of \u00a9 =1.5 and tan 5=10 and these were used in the Ansoft HFSS\u2122 simulation o this prototype. The solar cell has a side length and a thickness of W,=55 mm and 1.8 mm, respectively, whereas its left and right output pins at the back have a height of 0.2 mm. Because of the thickness of the solar cell (1.8 mm) and the height of the output pins (0.2 mm), the DR 116 has a displacement of 2mm from the substrate. This information was input in the HFSS simulation. The ground plane substrate has a dielectric con- stant of \u20ac,=2.33, a thickness of d=1.57 mm, and a size o. 16x16 cm\u2019. It can serve as an additional insulator between the solar cell and the ground plane. The output pins of the solar cell were connected to a voltmeter and an ammeter for mea- surements of the voltage and current, respectively. To study the focusing effect of the DR 116, the solar cell is maske: witha circular area having a radius of R.=15 mm. A", "type": "Document"}}
