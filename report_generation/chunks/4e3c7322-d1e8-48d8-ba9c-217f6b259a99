The coupling agent can be chemically bonded to a polymer and a metallic material of the hybrid material. The coupling agent can be, for example, a silane coupling agent. In certain embodiments, the coupling agent can be 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethacrylate or 3-aminopropylt- rimethoxysilane. A coupling agent treatment can be per- ormed, optionally including a solvent and a catalyst. A catalyst can be, for example, propylamine or triethylamine; and a solvent can be, for example, cyclohexane or toluene.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nantation Example 1: Plasma Immersion Ion Imp (PIU)\n\nOne of the surface modification methods can be PIII, and the implantation sources that can be used include nitrogen (N,), oxygen (O,), carbon (C), ammonia (NH;), aluminum (Al), zirconium (Zr), iron (Fe), silicon (Si), strontium (Sr), calcium (Ca), and water. Table 1 shows implantation con- ditions for the implantation sources of nitrogen, water, and strontium. All values listed will work with slight variations, such that each value should be interpreted as having the word \u201cabout\u201d in front of it.", "type": "Document"}}
