One possible reason for the formation of these tiny pores is the flash freezing at a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius or lower. As the skilled reader would know, flash freezing creates many points of nucleation in the deionised\n\nof\n\nused\n\nin\n\nDec. 23, 2021\n\nwater resulting in the growth of many disconnected ice crystals, and the spaces between the ice crystals provide the pores or capillaries.\n\n[0034] Flash freezing is provided by the huge temperature difference between the natural freezing point of zero degrees Celsius, and to some extent by the small volume of water in each well 103 that makes conduction of heat away from the water easier or speedier.\n\n[0035] Therefore, it is proposed that, separating the deion- ized water into different, small portions according to the plurality of wells 103 in the 24-well microplate 101 allows faster chilling of the water to create multiple sites of nucleation, increasing the certainty of creating more simi- larly sized pores. However, the skilled reader would under- stand that use of relatively small wells to create ice is a preferred feature but not a requirement in every embodiment of the invention.\n\n[0036] Before being applied onto the surface of the ice, the drug is first dissolved in a hydrophobic solvent with rela- tively low boiling point. A single shot of the ensuing hydrophobic solution is dropped onto the surface of each piece of the ice formed in the wells 103, at 205, using a pipet. To keep the ice from melting, the microplate 101 is kept on an ice pedestal (not illustrated) while the hydropho- bic solution is being applied onto the top surface of the pieces of ice, and also while the solution is given time to infuse into pores in the ice.\n\nin", "type": "Document"}}
