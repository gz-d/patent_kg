However, in addition to a mismatch in mechanical properties and poor biocompatibil- ity, magnesium alloys exhibit problems with a rapid degra- dation rate and hydrogen gas accumulation upon implanta- tion. Rapid corrosion results in the release of a large amount of magnesium ions together with a large volume of hydrogen gas generated. As shown in Reactions (1)-(3) below, if an increase in corrosion rate leads to an increase in magnesium ions. Accordingly, magnesium hydroxide is formed, and\n\nYet another embodiment is a method of fabricating a ybrid material comprising biodegradable polymer and a biodegradable metallic material, wherein the method can comprise: performing a surface treatment process on the iodegradable metallic material; melting a biodegradable olymer by a thermal process to obtain a polymer melt;\n\nThe\n\nis\n\ndivisional\n\nof U.S.\n\nPatients\n\nwith orthopedic fractures\n\nor\n\ndeformities\n\nare\n\ncomplication.\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n35\n\n60\n\n65\n\nto\n\nproperties.
