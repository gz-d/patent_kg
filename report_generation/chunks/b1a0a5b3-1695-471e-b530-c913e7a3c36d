The pinhole size is then adjusted to a value, so that the airy value is 1.00. The \u201cFind\u201d button in the side menu bar is used to adjust detector gain, offset and amplifier gain automatically. Detector gain and amplifier gain, if necessary, are to be adjusted to enhance intensity and. for the detector offset to suppress background noise. The position of starting optical section (\u201cslice\u201d) is defined and. marked by selecting \u201cMark first\u201d. Similarly, the position of ending optical section is defined and marked by selecting \u201cMark last\u201d. The interval and number of slice was defined by setting \u201cX:Y:Z: =1:1:1\u201d so that the resolution of the Z-axis is set as X and Y resolution. Series stack confocal images are then captured, saved, and recorded in CD-R for backup. Con- focal images can be exported as TIFF (16-bit raw image) by using the standalone version of LSM image browser (Carl Zeiss) for analysis in other image analysis software, e.g. MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, USA).\n\ng.
