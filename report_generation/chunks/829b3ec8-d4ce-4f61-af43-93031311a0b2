The system of claim 1, wherein at least the micro- protrusions of the microneedle-based drug delivery module coated with two different conductive metals which delay biodegradation thereof when it is in contact with the tissues the site of delivery.\n\nare\n\nof\n\n17. The system of claim 17, wherein the two different conductive metals coated on the at least microprotrusions of the microneedle-based drug delivery module are magnesium and tungsten.\n\n18. The system of claim 18, wherein the magnesium coatings have a thickness ratio of 10:1.\n\ntungsten\n\nand\n\n19. A method of using the implantable microneedle-based. electrostimulation system according to claim 1 for deliver- one or more potential drug candidates to a target site recipient in the absence of removing the system from recipient by surgical operation, the method comprising:\n\ning\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nimplanting an assembly of the wirelessly-controlled elec- trostimulation module and microneedle-based drug delivery module connected by at least two tungsten- coated magnesium foil lines onto a tissue surface of the target site at where the microprotrusions of the microneedle-based drug delivery module are at least partially inserted into the tissues of the target site while the substrate of the microneedle-based drug delivery module is in contact with the remaining tissue surface which is a contact surface between the tissues and the substrate of the microneedle-based drug delivery mod- ule excluding holes or slots formed during the insertion of the microprotrusions of the microneedle-based drug\n\ndelivery module;\n\nclosing a wound on the skin of the recipient incised during the implantation of the implantable microneedle-based electrostimulation system;", "type": "Document"}}
