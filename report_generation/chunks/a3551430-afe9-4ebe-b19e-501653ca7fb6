The microstrip antenna may include further layers or components. The absorptive filter includes a filter element at least partly arranged inside the substrate. Preferably, the filter element is arranged substantially completely inside the substrate.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the filter element comprises a resistor. The resistor may be a chip resistor.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the absorptive filter further comprises: a defected microstrip structure arranged in the microstrip network and a defected ground structure arranged in the ground plane. The defected microstrip structure and the defected ground structure are operably connected with the filter element.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip antenna is a patch antenna and microstrip network comprises a patch. The patch may be arranged centrally of the substrate.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch includes a central portion, and the defected microstrip structure comprises one or more slots arranged (e.g., etched) 1n the central portion of the patch. The slot(s) may be U-shaped. The central portion of the patch may include one or more open stubs each associated with a respective slot. In one example, the patch has two open stubs, e.g., two Ag/4 open stubs, where Ag 1s the guided wavelength at the center frequency.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch further includes a first side portion connected with and arranged a first side of the central portion and a second side portion connected with and arranged at a second, opposite side of the central portion. Each of the first and second side portions includes one or more stubs. In one example, each of the first and second side portions includes a dual-stub or a dual-stub feed. The stubs in the dual stub or dual stub feed can be of different lengths.", "type": "Document"}}
