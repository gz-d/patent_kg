SaCas9- HF also had significantly fewer off-target sites compared to the R245A mutant on EMX1_1, EMX1_4 and EMX1_10. WT-SaCas9 and the R245A mutant had substantial level of activity on EMX1_1 that contains a NNARRT PAM and. activity on NNYRRT PAM sites.\n\nExample 4\n\n30\n\nExample 2\n\nEpistasis Effect of SaCas9 Residues on Targeting Specificity\n\nGenome-Wide Targeting Specificity by the Single Substitution SaCas9 Mutants\n\nThe inventors constructed all combinations of modified proteins, i.e. double/triple/quadruple mutants from the four R245A, N413A, N419A, and R654A mutations to test for improved DNA specificity. GUIDE-seq were performed on the modified proteins with one or more mutations of R245A, N413A, N419A, and R654A targeting three endogenous human sites. GUIDE-Seq showed significant improvement by SaCas9-HF (modified protein with mutations of R245A, N413A, N419A, and R654A) at three endogenous sites, namely EMX1_6, VEGFA_8 and FANCF_13.\n\n35", "type": "Document"}}
