[0003] Titanium carbides and nitrides have excellent mechanical and chemical properties, for example, good wear resistance, inactive with numbers of chemical substances and outstanding hardness [11-16]. Titanium oxides are known to be fairy compatible with living tissues [17-20]. They are also inactive to many chemical reactions. In surface coating industries, these elements have been applied to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties of the substrates through various methods [21-25] for a period of time.", "type": "Document"}}
