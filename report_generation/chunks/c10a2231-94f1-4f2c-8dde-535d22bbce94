Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which has been identified to use as an electret material with high negative charge storage capability and robust stability that can be preserved through continuous droplet impinging, is designed on the top\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\n9\n\nof ITO\n\nsource to function as\n\na\n\nvirtual\n\nsource.\n\nThe PTFE enables the electrostatic induction of\n\npositive charges on ITO. Experiment leading to the present invention have demonstrated that the spreading of the soft, configurable droplet bridges the originally disconnected components in the device into a closed, electrical system, transforming the conventional solid/liquid interfacial effect a desirable bulk effect. Such a unique design allows for the reversible and efficient transfer charges between the source/virtual source and drain, resulting in the enhancement of power density by several orders of magnitude as opposed to its counterparts imposed by the interfacial effect. The present invention is applicable in a variety of systems or applications, and can\n\ninto\n\nof\n\nrepresent a paradigm-shift in the design of advanced devices for efficient energy harvesting.\n\nThe\n\nfirst\n\ncombined\n\ninvention relates two\n\nis concerned", "type": "Document"}}
