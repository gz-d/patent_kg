Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim where- in said second winding (8) is a spiral winding.\n\n1. A battery charging apparatus comprising an induc- tive charging platform including a charging surface on which an electrical device to be charged is to be placed, a first winding (7) for generating lines of mag- netic flux generally perpendicular to the charging sur- face, and a second winding (8) located within an area defined by the first winding (7) for generating an aux- iliary magnetic flux generally perpendicular to the charging surface, characterised in that the flux gen- erated by said second winding (8) compensates for a reduction in flux generated by said first winding (7), thereby generating magnetic flux substantially uni- formly over the surface of the charging platform.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n13. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim where- in said first winding (7) and said second winding (8) are generally rectangular.\n\n14. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 12 wherein said first winding (7) and said second winding (8) are generally circular.\n\n15. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim where- in a third winding is provided located within said area defined by said first winding (7).\n\n20\n\n2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said second winding (8) is located concentrically with respect to said first winding (7).\n\n16. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim where- in the magnitude of the flux generated by the first winding (7) is greater than the magnitude of the flux generated by the second winding (8).\n\n25", "type": "Document"}}
