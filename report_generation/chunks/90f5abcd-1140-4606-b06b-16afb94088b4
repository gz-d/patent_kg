In general, the power loss of the diode rectifier and the SDSR for the capacitive load and inductive load can be analyzed in the same way as the resistive load. The major power loss reduction component comes from the difference between the conduction loss of the diodes in the diode bridge and the on-state resistance of the MOSFETs in the SDSR. For a current of 10 A, for example, a diode has a conduction loss of about 10 W, while a MOSFET (with on- state resistance of 45 m2) only dissipates 4.5 W.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\no\n\nthe\n\npower\n\nbe\n\na\n\ndiode\n\nand\n\nis\n\nUS 8,913,409 B2\n\n17\n\n18\n\ndepicts a diagram of example graph 1400 comprising a rec\n\nExperimental verification based on a single-phase syn\n\ntified DC output capacitor voltage waveform associated with\n\nchronous rectifier was performed to compare a SDSR, in\n\nthe conventional diode bridge in relation to the capacitive\n\naccordance with aspects and embodiments of the Subject\n\nspecification, with a conventional diode bridge.
