These reflective filter-antennas reflect most of the incident energy in the stopband. The reflected energy may be transferred to other components (e.g., a power amplifier associated with the filter-antenna) in the system, which may lead to instability (e.g., self-oscillation in the power ampli- fier). One option to avoid or mitigate this instability problem is to use isolators, circulators, and/or attenuators in the system to reduce the effect of the reflected energy on the system. However, this option would increase the number of the components in the system, making the system cumber- some and expensive while potentially increasing the inser- tion loss.\n\n[0013] In one eml symmetric about an axis of symmetry.

By absorbing or dissipating the energy, e.g., energy received from an external source, reflection of energy (which may otherwise affect stability of other com- ponents/devices) can The filter-antenna can e prevented, reduced, or eliminated. be used for transmission, receiving, or both.\n\n[0015] The defected ground structure may further com- prise a first side slot arranged on a first side of the central slot and a second side slot arranged on a second, opposite side of the central slot. The first and second side slots are arranged to assist in absorbing or dissipating the energy. The first and second side slots can be symmetrically disposed about the axis of symmetry. The first and second side slots may have the same shape and size. The first and second side slots may be a generally-q shaped.", "type": "Document"}}
