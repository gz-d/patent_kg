FIG. 4 shows the thermoelectric device 100 wrapped around the forearm 400 of a user. The thermoelec- tric device 100 is connected to a multimeter 410. The probes of the multimeter are connected to the electrodes on the thermoelectric device 100. As seen in FIG. 4 the thermo- electric device 100 generates a voltage of 5.3 mV based on the body heat applied to the device 100. The thermoelectric device 100 converts body heat to electricity and generates a voltage. A current flow is induced due to the voltage.\n\n[0166] The device 100, 200 may also be integrated into electronic gadgets such as for example a human exoskel- eton. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 can be easily integrated into an electronic gadget. Thermoelectric device 200 can also function as a flexible thermoelectric generator for large scale energy harvesting in industries e.g. harvesting heat from pipes to generate electricity i.e. electric power.\n\nshown in FIG. 5A illustrates the thermoelectric device 100 powering a wrist watch from the body heat of the user. The thermoelectric device 100 is wrapped about the forearm 500 of the user, adjacent the wrist 510. The thermoelectric device 100 is connected to a DC/DC converter, which is coupled to a storage capacitor, which is coupled to the wrist watch. The DC/DC converter and storage capacitor are not visible but the schematic is indicated in FIG. 5A. As shown in FIG. 5A the wrist watch is powered and is functioning thereby illustrating the thermoelectric device 100 successfully func- tions as a power source by harvesting body heat. FIG. 5B illustrates an infrared image of the thermoelectric device 100 on the forearm of the user. The forearm heat, heating a user contacting side of the device 100 which creates a tempera- ture difference across the device 100 and the thermoelectric", "type": "Document"}}
