Therefore, the solution of one drop can flow and form a layer over another layer of the solution. Hence, as shown in FIG. 8, this can create localized areas of multiple layers of the solution, which may not all have seeped into the pores of the ice fully, at 803.\n\n[0051] This possibly causes some of the drug to precipitate outside the restraint of the pore space, at 805, precipitating relatively large drug particles when the solvent is removed by ventilation, which expands the range of the particle size of the nanodrug 213, and reducing particle size uniformity of the nanodrug 213. As a result, nanodrugs produced this way have a broad range of particle size, at 807.\n\n[0052] It is not desirable to apply a single drop of solution onto the ice 701, as the overall size of the ice 701 takes up precious space in the freezer, and is therefore not economical or highly productive.\n\nthe\n\n1\n\n[0053] Comparing with prior art of FIG. 7 to FIG. 8, walls defining the wells 103 in the microplate 101 of FIG. to FIG. 3 provide multiple, functionally separated, con- fined, topside ice surfaces that are relatively small compared a slab of ice produced using a beaker 703.\n\nthe\n\nto\n\n[0054] Accordingly, the embodiment provides a plurality of areas, each area suitable for infusion with a drop of the solution of the drug, without need of multiple drops of the solution to cover the entire surface. This allows the techni- cian to apply a single drop of the solution into each well 103 relatively quickly, while preventing superposing of multiple drops of the solution in a single area. That is, 24 drops of the solution can be applied into respective well 103 in the microplate 101 of FIG. 1, each drop confined and segregated by the boundaries of the wells 103.", "type": "Document"}}
