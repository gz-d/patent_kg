Moreover, as shown in FIGS. 2D and 2E, the pre- treatment of cells with berbamine markedly inhibited the protein expression of JEV-NSI and ZIKV-E in a dose dependent manner. The inventors further performed a virus titration assay and confirmed that pretreatment of cells with berbamine significantly inhibited the production of JEV according to the results in FIG. 2F. FIG. 2G also shows that the pretreatment of A549 cells or BHK-21 cells with ber- bamine markedly reduced JEV-induced cell death. These data indicated that berbamine has inhibitory effect against both JEV and ZIKV infection in host cells.\n\n[0082] Furthermore, as demonstrated in FIG. 1D, calcium influx is required for the entry of JEV or ZIKV. The inventors further determined whether treatment of host cells with berbamine can block the entry of these viruses. To evaluate this, A549 cells were pre-treated with berbamine for 1 h, and were then infected with JEV for 80 min before fixation. Viral positive strand RNA hybridization was sub- sequently performed to detect the RNA genome of JEV. The results in FIG. 3A show that the positive strand JEV RNA was only detected inside control cells, not in cells pretreated with berbamine.", "type": "Document"}}
