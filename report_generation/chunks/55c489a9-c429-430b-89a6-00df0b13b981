The condition affects 5 in every 100,000 people worldwide, and is incurable. Although there are some treatments to help relieve the symptoms associated with SCA, the existing treatments and devices may provide prolonged stimulation of the entire brain area in patients which may result in increased risks of adverse side effects. Also, the continuous stimulation by the pulse generator significantly reduces the battery life of the device and therefore requires frequent replacement of the device.\n\n[0020] processing the EMG signal via a processor to generate a EMG pattern based on the EMG signal, and outputting a stimulation signal to the neural electrode when the EMG pattern is indicative of the abnormal locomotion.\n\n[0021] In an embodiment, more than one EMG electrode implanted in tibialis anterior and/or gastrocnemius muscle.\n\n[0022] In an embodiment, the subject suffers from ataxia. Preferably, the subject suffers from spinocerebellar ataxia.\n\n[0023] In an embodiment, the processor includes a fiel programmable gate array.\n\n[0004] Accordingly, there remains a strong need for a novel system and method which have application in the modulation of the abnormal or unstable motor movement particularly in a subject suffering from a neurodegenerative disorder.\n\n[0024] In an embodiment, the data acquisition unit is in communication with the neural electrode for recording neu- ronal activity of the subject during a gait movement.\n\n[0025] In an embodiment, the processor generates a gait cycle based on the EMG pattern and optionally neuronal activity recorded by the neural electrode.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
