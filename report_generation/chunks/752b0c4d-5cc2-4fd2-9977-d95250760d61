Due to the presence of the series equivalent resistance, there is a steady-state error of 60 mV. With the active cancellation technique, as the series equivalent inductance is significantly reduced, the settling time is about 80 ns. Moreover, as the series equivalent resis- tance is also reduced, there is almost zero steady-state error.\n\nThe magnitude of vs is thus the required output voltage of the proposed apparatus. It is then used to drive a class AB amplifier through a buffer 460 formed by A4. The class AB amplifier 470 consists of two stages. The first stage 470a is a non-inverting amplifier formed by A; az and Rg. The second stage 470+ is the power stage formed by the coupling capaci- torC;, Ray Ryo Ros: Ripa Qpiasr Q1 ANd Qo.

The ac component of the output of the class AB amplifier is coupled to the output of the apparatus through the capacitor C,. The non-inverting amplifier and the power stage form a feedback system such that the output of the apparatus has to be the same as v3. Thus, the value of the output of the apparatus will be equal to", "type": "Document"}}
