Alternatively, the regulator may comprise a switched type voltage regulator.\n\nThe current compensation signal may comprise a linear- current source.\n\nThe compensation signal may be applied to the output passive component following a reference signal feedback loop of the regulator. This is advantageous in that it is unnec- essary to change or alter the control feedback loop or the controller stage of the regulator. Furthermore, it simplifies connection of the compensator circuit to the output stage of the regulator.\n\nThe regulator may comprise a linear type voltage regulator.
