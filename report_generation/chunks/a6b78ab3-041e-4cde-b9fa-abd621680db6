Based on the ratio of the capacitors used in the valley-fill circuits, the output voltage ripple can be further controlled and reduced. Thus, it can be used to provide a DC voltage source with an even more reduced voltage variation than that, or example, described above. Further, if an inductor is con- nected to the output of the valley-fill circuit in order to turn the voltage source into a current source, a current source with a further reduced current ripple can also be generated.\n\nHowever, the output DC voltage of the valley-fill circuit can be further reduced so as to further reduce the output ripple in the DC current and/or the size of the filter inductor. For capacitors connected in series, it is well known that the volt- age of across each capacitor depends on the size of the capaci- tance. FIG. 29 shows one example of two capacitors con- nected in series. Note that the current flow into this series circuit branch is the same in the two capacitors regardless of their capacitance. That is to say, the capacitors have the same amount of charge for a given series current flow. The voltage across each capacitor is inversely proportional to the size of the capacitor.\n\nThis further aspect of the present invention is particularly suitable to a variety of applications in which a fairly constant output current source is required. Thus, although this aspect of the invention will be described with reference to drivers for LED loads for general lighting applications such as those described above, this aspect of the invention can be applied. more generally.", "type": "Document"}}
