That is, the word does not preclude additional or unrecited elements, substances or method steps, in addition to those specifically recited. Thus, the described apparatus, substance or method may have other elements, substances or steps in various embodiments. The term \u201ccomprising\u201d (and its grammatical variations) as used herein are used in the inclusive sense of \u201chaving\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d and not in the sense of \u201cconsisting only of\u2019.\n\n[0072] FIG. 8C is a plot of tensile strength against strain the AD-gel electrolyte at 25\u00b0 C., -20\u00b0 C., and 80\u00b0 C.\n\n[0073] FIG. 8D is a bar chart showing compression strength of the AD-gel electrolyte and the PAM-hydrogel normal, cold or hot environments.\n\n[0074] FIG. 8E is a plot of compression strength against strain of the AD-gel electrolyte at 25\u00b0 C., -20\u00b0 C., and\n\n[0075] FIG. 9A is a series of optical images showing the appearance of the AD-gel electrolyte and the PAM-hydrogel before and after being stored in open air for 10 or 30 days.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0076] FIG. 9B is a plot of weight ratio against storage time of the AD-gel electrolyte and the PAM-hydrogel cor- responding to FIG. 9A.\n\n[0054] Notwithstanding any other forms which may fall within the scope of the present disclosure, a preferred embodiment will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:\n\n[0077] FIG. 10A is a series of optical images showing the appearance of the AD-gel electrolyte and the PAM-hydrogel after subjecting to freeze-dry or storing at 80\u00b0 C. for 24 h.\n\n[0055] FIG. 1A illustrates of an electrical energy storage device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
