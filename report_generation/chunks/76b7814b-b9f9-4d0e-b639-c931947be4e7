Power adaptors (or AC-DC pow- er converters) are traditionally used to charge the batter- ies in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic products, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable elec- tronic equipment.\n\nPRIOR ART", "type": "Document"}}
