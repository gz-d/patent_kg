Since the flicker distortion on the temporal layer is measured, the edge maps set {E,,'} is converted into temporal edge layers {M\u3002 ,}, where {M, ,}={D\u00b0#*(xy,t)I1 <=x<W, y=i, 1<t<T}. If the distortion along the edges flicks or changes in a very short time, i.e., the number o edge pixels in temporal layer is very small, the human eyes can hardly perceive this flickering. In this case, it is assumed that possible flicker perception is caused only if the number of edge pixels in patches of the temporal layer Mi exceeds a threshold B in a predetermined period.
