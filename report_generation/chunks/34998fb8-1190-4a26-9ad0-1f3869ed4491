The real time control can be on the order of seconds (e.g., performing selection or switching within 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, ...), milliseconds (ms) (e.g., performing selection or switch- ing within 1 ms, 2 ms, 3 ms, . . . ), or less, for example. In an aspect, the projector screen component 102 can comprise a control region 112, ofa specified size (e.g., spatial size, speci- fied number of pixels), that can be formed in a portion of the projector screen. The projector screen component 102 can provide (e.g., present, generate, display, etc.) a signal via the control region 112, wherein the signal can be, for example, an optical signal (e.g., optical signal having an optical (e.g.\uff0c light) pattern, optical signal having or providing a specified number of data bits that can correspond to a specified data value based at least in part on the respective data values of the", "type": "Document"}}
