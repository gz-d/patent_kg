The analog circuit 400 includes, simply, a multiplier (current or voltage multiplier) that determines -B-sin \u00bb, and an adder 404, which adds A' to -B-sin \u4e2d . The output signal may be a current signal or a voltage signal.\n\n[0044] Although required, with reference to the Figures can be implemented as an application programming interface (API) or as a series o libraries for use by a developer or can be included within another software application, such as a terminal or personal computer operating system or a portable computing device operating system. Generally, as program modules include routines, programs, objects, components and data files assisting in the performance of particular functions, the skilled person will understand that the functionality of the software application may be distributed across a number of routines, objects or components to achieve the same func-", "type": "Document"}}
