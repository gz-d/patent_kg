The applied heat causes a temperature difference across the device. The temperature difference across the p type semiconductor element and the n type semiconductor element causes charge to flow within the semiconductor elements. The flow of charge is an electrical current, and the electrical current generated may be output as electrical power output for powering an electrical load connected to the thermoelectric\n\n[0121] FIG. 5A illustrates a test set up of the tric device of FIG. 1A, 1B wrapped around an arm of person and coupled to a wrist watch to test if the device can power a wrist watch.\n\n[0122] FIG. 5B illustrates an infrared image of the ther- moelectric device of FIG. 1A, 1B on the forearm of the user.\n\n[0123] FIG. 6A illustrates the thermoelectric device of FIG. 2A, 2B disposed on a pipe and coupled to a multimeter to test operation of the device.\n\n[0124] FIG. 6B illustrates an infrared image of the ther- moelectric device of FIG. 2A, 2B disposed on a pipe.", "type": "Document"}}
