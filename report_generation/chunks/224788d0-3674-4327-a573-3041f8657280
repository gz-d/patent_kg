Therefore, silver with topological nanostructure surface attracted increased interest in various fields.\n\n[0031] In one aspect of the present invention, the metallic structure is in the form of a wire, a foil, a mash, a foam, structure or a needle.\n\n[0032] In one aspect of the present invention, the metallic structure is a substrate for Surface Enhanced Raman Spec- troscopy (SERS), sensing, catalysis, therapeutics or plasmo- electronics.\n\n[0051] The present invention relates to a facile and robust electrochemical method which bestows Ag metals with nanostructured surface based on the pulse electrochemical techniques in a one-pot one-step manner. Metal nanostruc- tures are constructed at Ag substrate at nanoscale throug! rapid pulse electrochemistry and as a result, the Ag substrate is evenly coated by various metal nanomaterials. The whole procedure may be carried out in a typical three electrode aqueous system using pulse electrochemistry at ambient conditions. The compositions and specific texture of the thus-created surface is well controlled through adjusting the electrochemical parameters and the electrolyte recipes. Thus, the present invention shows great potential for large scale production.\n\n[0033] It is an object of the present invention to address the above needs, to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages or, more generally, to provide an improved method for treating a surface of a metallic struc- ture, and in particular, a needle made of noble metals.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
