To demonstrate the gen\n\nerality of our generator , we then measured the electricity\n\ninside PTFE prevents the directional flow of positive\n\ngeneration under different aqueous solutions . At low ion\n\ncharges in bulk water toward the PTFE surface , thereby\n\nsuppressing the formation of an effective EDL at the liquid /\n\nconcentration of 10-7 mol / L ( pure DI water ) , the electricity\n\ngeneration is negligible owing to the shortage of sufficient\n\nPTFE interface ( i , ii ) . In contrast , when the PTFE and drain\n\nare connected by the spreading droplet ( iii ) , the presence of\n\nions for the formation of EDLs at both the source / water and\n\ndrain / water interfaces simultaneously . The maximum peak\n\nhigher potential on the drain over the PTFE leads to the\n\nvoltage up to ~ 170 V appears when the ion concentration is\n\nbuilding of an additional electric field E2 within the droplet ,\n\nthereby transforming the original random motion of ions\n\nincreased to 10-3 mol / L , beyond which the output voltage\n\ninto a directional flow , with positive and negative ions\n\ndecays .
