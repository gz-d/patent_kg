The capacitive arrangement and the transmission line arrangement of the second circuit arrangement may be arranged electrically in parallel. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement of the first circuit arrangement is grounded. In some examples, the transmission line arrange- ment of the first circuit arrangement is grounded.\n\n[0111] In some embodiments, the construction of the first circuit arrangement and the construction of the second circuit arrangement are generally identical (but connected to different source terminals of different transistors).\n\n[0112] In some embodiments, the third circuit arrange- ment includes a transmission line arrangement operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement 2604 and an AC short termination arrangement electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement. In some examples, the AC short termination arrangement of the third circuit arrangement includes a grounded capacitive arrangement electrically connected in series with the transmission line arrangement. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the third circuit arrangement includes: a first transmission line portion with an end electrically connected. in series with the AC short termination arrangement, and a second transmission line portion extending from the first transmission line portion and electrically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement 2604 for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. The two transmission line por- tions may be generally perpendicular.", "type": "Document"}}
