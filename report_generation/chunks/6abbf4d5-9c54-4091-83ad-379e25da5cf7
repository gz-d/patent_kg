One exemplary cold cathode element is\n\nnected with the control element for changing the electric\n\nmade of single crystal tungsten sharpened to a tip . One\n\nfield provided by the control element . In operation the\n\nexemplary Schottky element is made by coating a tungsten\n\nelectron emission element acts as a cathode and the elec\n\ntip with a layer of zirconium oxide .\n\ntrode act as an anode . The power supply may be a voltage 35\n\nIn accordance with a second aspect of the invention , there\n\nsupply . The electrode and the control element may each be\n\nis provided an apparatus comprising the electron gun of the\n\nconnected , directly or indirectly , with a respective terminal\n\nfirst aspect . The apparatus may be an electron microscope ,\n\nof the power supply . By using the same power supply for the\n\nsuch as a scanning electron microscope , a semiconductor\n\nelectrode and the control element ( instead of using respec-\n\ninspection apparatus , a particle accelerator , etc.\n\ntive power supplies for the electrode and the control ele- 40\n\nIn accordance with a third aspect of the invention , there\n\nment ) , along with the control circuit that controls the control\n\nis provided a method for operating the electron gun of the\n\nelement , the electron gun can be made simpler yet can be\n\nfirst aspect . The method includes controlling the control\n\neffectively controlled to control electron beam emission to\n\ncircuit to adjust an electric field provided by the control\n\nsuit different applications .\n\nelement .\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect , the control circuit 45\n\nIn accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention , there\n\nis arranged to provide a variable resistance for changing the\n\nis provided a method for operating the apparatus of the\n\nelectric field provided by the control element .\n\nsecond aspect .
