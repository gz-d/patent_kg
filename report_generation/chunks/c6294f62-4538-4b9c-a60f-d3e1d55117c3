For example, the noble metal can be ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Qs), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), gold (Au), and silver (Ag).\n\n[0073] Referring to FIGS. 4A, 4C, 4E, the 20 nm-thick organic-gold nanosheets on the silicon substrates were annealed according to different annealing conditions, such as at 450\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, at 600\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, or at 300\u00b0 C. for 120 minutes. The results show that the as-fabricated nanoparticles have a different size distribution, the quantification results were shown in FIGS. 4B (0-500 nm), 4D (100-400 nm) and 4F (0-400 nm).\n\n[0074] Referring to FIGS. 5A and 5C, different thickness G.e. 11 nm or 80 nm) organic-gold nanosheets on the sapphire substrates were annealed according to the same annealing conditions of 600\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. FIG. 5B shows that the thinner (11 nm) nanosheets on the sapphire substrate have a particle size of approximately 10-70 nm, and FIG. 5D shows that the thicker (80 nm) nanosheets on the sapphire substrate have a particle size of approximately 100-1200 nm.\n\n[0075] Moreover, the freestanding nanosheets can also be transferred onto non-planar substrates. For example, FIGS. 6A and 6B show the case when 20 nm-thick organic-gold nanosheets on non-planar substrates, such as Mo grid or AAO plate. Both organic-gold nanosheets were annealed according to the same annealing conditions of 600\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes.\n\nTo further understand the formation of", "type": "Document"}}
