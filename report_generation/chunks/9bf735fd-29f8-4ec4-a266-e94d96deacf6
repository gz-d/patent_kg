In an embodiment herein, R,~R; together with the main ring structure are derivatives of coumarin or rhodamine. It is believed that by changing R,~Rs, the obtained coumarin or rhodamine derivatives can be tuned to present various photo properties (e.g. different excitation and emission wave- lengths). Accordingly, the various treatment objectives, the hoto properties and photooxidation properties of the plat- inum(IV) complexes may be tuned by choosing the appro- priate derivatives. For example, for skin cancer treatment, latinum(IV) complexes with relatively shorter excitation wavelength may be preferred, since the shorter wavelength ight possesses higher energy, which could activate the Pt(IV) complexes more effectively as deep penetration is not needed for areas closer to the skin surface; whereas for ladder cancer treatment, platinum(IV) complexes with lon- ger excitation wavelength is preferred, because the tumor will typically be located deeper in the body; therefore a longer wavelength light with better tissue penetration may required. Some examples of coumarin and rhodamine derivatives useful herein and their excitation wavelengths\n\n(Ex) are provided below:\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\n-continued FE F CN oe oe Ex = 600 nm Qa /\n\nEx = 470 nm (one photon excitation) 880 nm (two photon excitation)\n\nEx = 712 nm\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\nEx =779 nm", "type": "Document"}}
