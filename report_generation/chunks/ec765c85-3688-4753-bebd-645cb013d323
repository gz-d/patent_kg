The communication system must check the identity and. compatibility of the loads so that items not designed or intended to be charged on the charging pad will not receive transmitted power. This feature ensures the safety of the users. For example, should a cigarette lighter be accidentally placed on the charging pad it must not receive any power from the charging pad. In addition, the bi-directional communica- tion should provide information for the battery charge condi- tion. When the loads are fully charged, the selected transmit- ter windings should stop energy transfer in order to reduce\n\nIn order for the charging pad to charge a wide range of portable electronic loads, a methodology is proposed that involves the combined use of several basic principles and technical features. In the following description, the primary energy-transmitting windings in the charging pad will be called \u201ctransmitter windings\u201d and the secondary energy-re- ceiving windings inside the electronic loads will be called \u201creceiver windings\u201d.\n\nIn the following description, these integrated technical will be explained in more detail.\n\nIn embodiments of this invention, (i) the receiver winding are larger than the transmitter windings, (ii) the receiver winding should fully cover at least one transmitter winding wherever the electronic load that contains the receiver wind- ing is placed on the charging surface of the charging pad and iii) one transmitter winding is sufficient to provide enough power transfer for the electronic load under consideration for the charging pad. As discussed above a multilayer structure of stacked windings can be used to enhance the magnetic flux for the same foot-print area. Preferably the area ratio of the receiver winding and one transmitter winding must be mini- mized that condition is satisfied.", "type": "Document"}}
