The present invention is further elaborated as fol-\n\nThe Effect of Continuous Droplet Impinging on Electricity Generation\n\nand retraction dynamics of water droplets were recorded by a high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM SA4) at a typical recording speed of 6000 fps. The voltage output of TIDE-G was measured using an oscilloscope (Rohde&schwarzrte, RTE1024) equipped with a high-impedance (10 MO) probe. The current and the transferred charges between the ITO (source) and Al electrode (drain) were measured using the oscilloscope coupled with a low-noise current preamplifier (Stanford Research System Model SR570) and a faraday cup connected with nanocoulomb meter (MONROE Model 284), respectively. The volume of water droplets was fixed at 100 wL and the as-fabricated device was tilted at 45\u00b0 for rapid liquid detachment. To measure the variation of maxi- mum charges Q,,,,, transferred from source to drain as a function of the Weber number or the maximum spreading area, the releasing heights of droplet were varied between 1 and 20 cm. In typical measurements, the relative humidity and the environment temperature were kept at approxi-", "type": "Document"}}
