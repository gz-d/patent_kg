In some embodiments in which the radiator is arranged or formed in an integrated circuit (chip), the thermal management device may be coupled to a back side of the integrated circuit. In some examples, the thermal management device comprises a passive thermal management device. For example, the passive thermal management device may include a heat sink with fins, pins, etc. In some examples, the thermal manage- ment device comprises an active thermal management device. For example, the active thermal management device may include a fan, a liquid-based heat exchange device, an\n\nevaporative heat exchanger, etc.\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n[0052] In some embodiments, the device lacks any lens disposed relative to the radiator for affecting (e.g., boosting) directivity of the terahertz electromagnetic radiation pro- vided by the radiator.\n\n[0053] In a fourth aspect, there is provided a system for providing terahertz electromagnetic radiation comprising at least one of the radiator of the first aspect. The system may be a sensing system, a communication system, a spectro- scopic system, an imaging system, etc. In one example, the system is an active terahertz imaging system arranged to illuminate objects (e.g., targeted objects). In one example, the system is a cellular (e.g., 5G, 6G, above 6G, or the like) communication system.", "type": "Document"}}
