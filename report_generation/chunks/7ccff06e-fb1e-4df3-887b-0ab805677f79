In par- ticular, the electrochemical treatment involves the alternat- ing electrochemical oxidation and reduction of the metallic structure 10, which may be triggered by applying different first and second voltages or currents to the metallic structure 10 for first and second durations e.g. time ranges from 0.001 s to 7200 s respectively for a number of cycles e.g. 10-15000 cycles. The first voltage is a positive or zero voltage and the second voltage is a negative voltage. For instance, the first voltage may be OV and the second voltage may be -8V.\n\n[0063] In particular, a pulsed voltage waveform is applied for over 1000 cycles with each cycle consisting of two steps: 0 V (oxidation) for tens of microseconds for releasing the Ag ion (Ag*) 12 in step 102, followed by -0.8 V (reduction) for tens of microseconds to deposit Ag nanoparticles 22 in step 104. Uniform and densely packed Ag nanoparticles in the form of nanospheres 22 with average diameters of 310 nm are then produced at the surface of SAN 10 and deposited as a nano-structured Ag layer 20 as depicted in FIG. 15.\n\n[0057] Preferably, the voltages or currents waveform may be in the form of square-shaped, triangular-shaped, sinusoi- dal-shaped or other profiles in which the first and second voltages or currents would remain constant in each cycle. The size of the nanoparticles 20 would be determined by the selection of the applied first and second voltages or currents and corresponding duration.", "type": "Document"}}
