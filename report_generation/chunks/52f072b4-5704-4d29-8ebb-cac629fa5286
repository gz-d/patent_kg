Buprenorphine (75 g/kg) was administered before surgery and the morning following surgery to relieve pain. A midline skin incision (10 mm) was made to locate the bregma and lambda sutures for precise stereotaxic electrode placement. The neural electrodes were bilaterally within the radius of 0.5 mm around the central point relative to the regma (\u20146.4 mm anteroposterior, +1.3 mm lateral and 2.5-3 mm deep) into the deep cerebellar nuclei and fixed to the skull with dental cement.\n\nmay electrode. Preferably, the more than one EMG electrode implanted in tibialis anterior and/or gastrocnemius muscle.\n\n[0083] It would be appreciated that the neurostimulation system and method of the present invention are useful to modulate the abnormal motor behaviour of a patient who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, particularly a cerebellar disorder. The present invention can be applied in medical applications such as for treating motor disorders associated with neurodegenerative diseases, rehabilitation activities, and the like.\n\nimplantation of EMG Electrodes in Tibialis Anterior Gastrocnemius Muscles", "type": "Document"}}
