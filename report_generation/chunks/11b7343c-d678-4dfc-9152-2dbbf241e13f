The first step is warping pixels from existing neighboring views to another new virtual view via DIBR. Due to dis-occlusion and rounding operations in warping, small holes may exist in the rendered image. The second step is hole filling and post- processing, namely inpainting the dis-occluded areas or holes from their surrounding pixels. However, due to imper- fect depth images and misalignment between color and depth image, some distortions such as contour artifacts and. geometrical distortions, may occur during the DIBR process. In addition, the compression distortion in color images will be transferred to the rendered images, while the depth distortions will induce the displacement of pixels, ie. geometrical distortion. The inconsistency between tempo- rally successive depth images caused by depth image gen- eration and compression may also induce inconsistent geo- metrical distortions among frames (also known as temporal\n\n[0086] In some embodiments, step 104A may include: determining respective extents of flicker distortion for each temporal frame of the synthesized video file, and determin- ing an overall extent of flicker distortion of the synthesized video file based on the respective extents of flicker distor- tion. Optionally, the respective extents of flicker distortion for each temporal frame of the synthesized video file are weighted to determine the overall extent of flicker distortion.", "type": "Document"}}
