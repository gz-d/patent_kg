The one or more solar cells of the cell component 320 can convert the light energy into electrical energy, for example, through a photovoltaic effect process, or indirectly by first converting the light energy into heat energy and converting the heat energy to electrical energy. The cell component 320 can include other electronic circuitry that can be used to transfer the power generated by the cell component 320 to other components, such as, for example, other compo- nents of the barrier control component 310 (e.g., power sup- ply component 322), the barrier component 308, and/or the projector screen component 302. In some implementations, a solar cell can be used as a light sensor to detect and identify the optical signals in the control region 312. In other imple- mentations, a solar cell can be used to detect light for use in generating electrical power, while other light detecting means (e.g., light sensors) can be used to detect and identify the optical signals in the control region 312. The light detecting means (e.g., solar cell/light sensor, and/or other light sensor) can be arranged to face the control region 312 to facilitate", "type": "Document"}}
