However, the use of passive components such as capacitors and/or inductors at the output does not fully resolve the problem of output signal ripple due to the capacitance or inductance characteristics of the passive components themselves and/or other circuit effects.\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS", "type": "Document"}}
