In LRSPR con- figuration, the prism coupling scheme comprises a prism 401, transducing layer of the sensing surface 402 is made of dielectric layer 406 which is sandwiched by two conducting material 405 and 407 such as gold or silver on the prism 401, and a sample flow chamber 404 associated with the prism 401 for guiding a sample 403 flowing over the sensing surface 407. The prism 401 can be made of transparent dielectric material such as plastic or glass in order to enhance the momentum of light to match with the momentum of SPW. an embodiment, a right-triangle prism made of BK7 glass employed. In the embodiment, the first layer of the conduct- ing material 405 from the prism surface is gold with a thick- ness of 48 nm. The second layer of the dielectric material 406 silicon dioxide with a thickness of 453 nm. The third layer of the conducting material 407 is gold with a thickness of nm. The choice of thickness for the layers depends on appli- cations and material selection. The sample flow chamber 404 designed to permit the sample 403 flowing in and out of the chamber 404 while making contact with the sensing surface. The introduction of LRSPR effect in the SPR sensing surface can sharpen the resonance peak so that the detection resolu- tion of phase-sensitive SPR biosensors can be further enhanced. The sample 403 is normally used in aqueous form.\n\nThe carrier frequency modulation unit 220 is illustrated in FIG. 4. The carrier frequency modulation unit 220 may includea liquid crystal variable retarder 221 and an electronic controller 223. The liquid crystal variable retarder 221 is used to introduce an extra OPD between the p-polarized beam and the s-polarized beam at each wavelength.
