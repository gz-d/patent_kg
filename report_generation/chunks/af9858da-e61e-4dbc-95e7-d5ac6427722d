At or near time t,, when the switch Ms reaches its predefined gate threshold switching voltage level, the switch Ms can switch from an off state to an on state and can begin to conduct. During the time period, the voltage vesi can begin to decrease from a high voltage level to a lower voltage level. The voltage vacs can continue to increase in voltage level. Before the switch M, reaches (e.g., before the gate-source voltage of the switch M, drops down to) the applicable predefined gate threshold switching voltage level (e.g., below which the switch will not be conductive) for the switch M, to switch from an on state to an off state, which can occur at time t,, the switch M7 and switch Ms can conduct simultaneously, as illustrated in FIG. 25C. At some point during this time period, the voltage v,,, can drop down to the applicable predefined gate threshold switching voltage of the switch 2102 (M,), the time of which can be controlled at least in part by the proportion (e.g., ratio) of the resistors Rs and Ry (e.g., ratio of R,/R,). The time period of time t, to t, can end when the voltage vs; drops down to a zero voltage and the switch 2102 (M, )has been switched to an off state, which can occur when the gate-source voltage of switch 2102 is below the predefined gate threshold switching voltage for switch", "type": "Document"}}
