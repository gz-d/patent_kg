More importantly, it can provide an antenna gain of more than 4 dBi across its entire passband, which is a new achievement for a transparent antenna.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nThe foregoing and further features of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments which are provided by way of example only connection with the accompanying figures, of which:\n\nPreferably, comprising transparent to light at and/or beyond optical frequencies, i.e. visible and/or invisible light frequencies. More preferably, material of the DR element comprises borosilicate glass. Preferably, the glass is borosilicate crown glass, commonly known by the tradenames \u201cPyrex\u201d or \u201cK9\u201d.\n\nFIGS. 1a and 16 are front side and top views respectively transparent rectangular DRA in accordance with the inven- with an underlaid solar cell;", "type": "Document"}}
