In one example, the encapsulation may be a polymer matrix having the same composition as the electrolyte 106. For example, the encap- sulation may have the same polymeric materials and elec- trolytic solution that constitute the electrolyte 106. That is, each of the anode and cathode is enclosed by a separate encapsulation 130 having the same composition as the electrolyte 106. Alternatively, the anode and the cathode may be directly enclosed in the electrolyte 106. In other words, the anode and the cathode are positioned within the electrolyte 106.\n\nsheet. The substrate 108 may have some electrical conduc- tance but is preferably robust enough to function within an electrolyte.\n\n[0138] The anode 102 preferably comprises zinc. In one example, the anode may be a zinc sheet, particularly a zinc nanosheet 114 that is electrodeposited onto SS mesh 108. The SS mesh 108 provides a base layer for the zinc to be deposited onto. The SS mesh 108 may also have a rough surface which in turn facilitating the deposition of materials thereon. The zinc is deposited to form a substantially thick layer of zinc 114. The thickness may depend on the opera- tional life of the battery 100.\n\n[0139] In one example, the electrodeposited zinc may be highly crystalline and uniformly cover the entire surface of the SS mesh. In particular, the electrodeposited zinc may have a highly porous architecture comprising interconnected nanosheets. For example, the nanosheets may be uniformly and vertically arranged on the SS mesh forming a laminated structure. This may be advantageous as the nanocrystalline and porous structure may reduce ion diffusion path which in turn facilitating electrolyte penetration as well as charge/ion transport.", "type": "Document"}}
