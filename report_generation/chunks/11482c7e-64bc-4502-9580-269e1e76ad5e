The client (s) 1510 are operatively connected to one or more client data store(s) 1520 that can be employed to store information local to the client(s) 1510. Similarly, the server(s) 1530 are opera- tively connected to one or more server data store(s) 1540 that can be employed to store information local to the servers 1530.\n\nIt is to be appreciated and understood that components (e.g., projector screen component, projector component, bar- rier component, barrier control component, sensor compo- nent, power supply unit, etc.), as described with regard to a particular system or method, can include the same or similar functionality as respective components (e.g., respectively named components or similarly named components) as described with regard to other systems or methods disclosed herein.\n\nexamples aspects of the disclosed subject matter. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of com- ponents or methodologies for purposes of describing the dis- closed subject matter, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the disclosed subject matter are possible. Accordingly, the disclosed subject matter is intended to embrace all such alter- ations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
