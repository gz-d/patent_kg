[0005] The invention also provides orthopedic, vascular, and esophageal implants made from the foregoing materials.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0006]\n\nFIG. 1 is a plot of Ni depth profiles acquired from the nitrogen, acetylene and oxygen PIII surface treated samples and control. FIG. 2 includes photomicrographs of treated and untreated NiTi (control) after two days of cell culturing showing the EGFP expressing mouse osteoblasts. (A) NiTi alloy without surface treatment, (B) with nitrogen PIII implantation, (C) with acetylene PIII implantation, and (D) with oxygen PIII implantation.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
