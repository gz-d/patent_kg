The present invention specifically targets the other two IncRNA DANCR and MALAT1 with different length expression levels and subcellular localization. The dysregu- lations of DANCR and MALAT1 expression relate to a variety of malignant tumors, including liver cancer, breast cancer, glioma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and lung cancer. The research of the present invention shows that DANCR can interact with proteins largely enriched in extracellular exosomes. Interestingly, it has been reported in various studies that serum DANCR levels are elevated in cancer patients. In addition, the present invention also identifies the interaction between DANCR and Ezrin (an important structural protein in the cell cortex). Such findings reveal the new function of IncRNA in tumor development.\n\n[0038] Label-free mass spectrometry is a direct and cost- effective method to apply CARPID. In addition, it has low technical requirements, thus ensuring wide applicability. The present invention has shown that CARPID is a powerful method for detecting RNA binding proteins, with high specificity and reproducibility. To further improve the reso- lution, quantitative mass spectrometry with different label- ing strategies (such as TMT and other isobaric chemical labeling and SILAC labeling) can be incorporated into the CARPID channel.\n\n[0039] In summary, the present invention combines CARPID, labeled quantitative mass spectrometry and non- parametric enrichment analysis, and can identify specific IncRNA interaction proteins in living cells with high con- fidence by using proteomics methods. The CARPID tech- nology of the present invention can draw a high-resolution spectrum of various IncRNAs interaction proteins involved in human diseases. Such spectrum can provide guidance for therapies that interfere with the function of specific IncR- NAs.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
