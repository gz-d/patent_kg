The nitrogen source is nitrogen gas. The carbon source is acetylene or a derivative thereof. The oxygen source is oxygen gas. [0009] The method may be used to make an orthopedic, vascular, or esophageal implant. [0010] For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition or related ion-beam and plasma-based techniques such as plasma-enhanced vapor phase deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (VPD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the surface of shape memory materials such as Ti - 50.8% at Ni alloy, the specific preferred embodiments of the invention will be described. [0011] Figure 1 indicates the Ni concentration profiles of the samples with and without PIII surface treatment. The Ni concentrations in the implanted region in nitrogen, acetylene and oxygen plasma-implanted samples are much lower when compared to the non-coated control sample. Nitrogen PIII gives rise to the highest Ni suppression compared to oxygen PIII. [0012] The treatment methods for acetylene, nitrogen and oxygen implantation the sample were ground, polished to a shiny surface texture, and then ultrasonically cleaned with acetone and ethanol before deposition or implantation was conducted in the plasma immersion ion implanter. The deposition and implantation parameters of acetylene, nitrogen and oxygen implantation samples were displayed in Table 1. The elemental depth profiles as shown in Figure 1 were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Physical Electronics PHI 5802, Minnesota, USA).", "type": "Document"}}
