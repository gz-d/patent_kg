For instance, at 2002 a portion of incident solar radiation at a selective transmission layer can be transmitted to a solar cell on a reflector of a communications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.). For example, methodologies 2000 can include transmit- ting a portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., such incident light 322 (522), etc. with regard to FIGS. 3-6) at a selective transmission layer (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) of the communications antenna to one or more solar cell(s) (e.g., one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.) on a reflector (e.g., reflector 702 of GA 700, etc.) of the commu- nications antenna, such as GA 700, etc. As a further example, the transmitting at 2002 can further include transmitting the portion of the incident solar radiation to one or more solar cell(s) via the selective transmission layer (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) located adjacent to the one or more solar cell(s) on a side opposite the reflector. In a further aspect, the selective transmission layer can comprise a grid of any com- bination of a metal, a metal wire, or a metallic composition,\n\nExemplary Coupled Filtering Results\n\nExemplary implementations of the disclosed subject (e.g., GA 300, GA 500, etc.) have been explored to dem- onstrate particular non-limiting aspects, advantages, and/or features.", "type": "Document"}}
