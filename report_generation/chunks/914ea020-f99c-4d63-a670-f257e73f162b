Because it is the target of most non-cardiac drugs that cause cardiac arrhythmia (Abriel et al. 2004; Joshi et al. 2004), special attention is paid to hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) which encodes for the pore-forming @ subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel. The channel is responsible for the repolarizing potassium current which is distinguished from other current by strong inward rectification. Inhibition of this channel, either by exogenous compounds or due to genetic mutation, increases the dura- tion of repolarization of action potential in cardiac myo- cytes, resulting in cardiac arrhythmias. Nevertheless, cardiac arrhythmia is not only due to the malfunction of hERG but also other ion channels, such as sodium channels and calcium channels. Thus, emphasis is put on the preclinical screening for new therapeutic compounds with any unex- pected cardiac toxic effects by highly sensitive and specific", "type": "Document"}}
