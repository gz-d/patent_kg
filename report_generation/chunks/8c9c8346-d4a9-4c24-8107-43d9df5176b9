Further, conventional techniques for providing power to the active parallax barrier can be inefficient for a variety of other rea- sons. The above-described deficiencies of today\u2019s systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and cor- responding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.\n\ncan realize 3-D visual effects in part by having different pixels carrying different views of a 3-D scene. The 3-D autostereo- scopic display is a technology that can combine multiple perspectives (e.g., multiple 2-D perspectives) of a 3-D scene into a single, integrated 2-D image. Using an autostereo- scopic monitor, the single, integrated 2-D image can be dis- played to a viewer such that each recorded view (e.g., 2-D image from each perspective) of the 3-D scene can be dis- played to the viewer along its corresponding orientation. For instance, as the viewer moves from left to right (or right to left) in relation to the 3-D scene, the viewer can observe different views of the 3-D scene as if the viewer is looking at the actual 3-D environment depicted by the 3-D scene. In addition to displaying multi-view images to the viewer, the autostereoscopic techniques also can provide a 3-D sensation to the viewer as each of the viewer\u2019s eyes can perceive a slightly different image (e.g., different 2-D image from a\n\nSUMMARY", "type": "Document"}}
