In the representative models, ellipses show ROIs corresponding to 2-D Gaussian emissions (FIGURE 1A). Prior values show the probabilities that a trial starts from the ellipse/ROI. Transition probabilities show probabilities of observing a particular transition to the next ROI from the current ROI. small images on the right show the assignment of actual fixations to the ROIs and corresponding fixation heatmaps. Note that the clustering algorithm (Coviello, Chan, Lanckriet, 2014) summarizes individual models in a cluster into a representative HMM using pre-specified number of ROIs, which may result in overlapping ROIs. Here the number ROIs in the representative models was set to 3, the median number of ROIs in the individual models. FIGURE 1B shows the frequency of young and older adults adopting holistic analytic patterns: significantly more older adults adopted holistic patterns and more young adults adopted analytic patterns.
