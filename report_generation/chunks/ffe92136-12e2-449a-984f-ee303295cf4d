The barrier component 108 can be a multi-mode active barrier component (e.g., comprising an active parallax barrier) or another type of multi-mode barrier component that can include one or more 2-D display modes for processing and/or presenting normal 2-D content, and one or more 3-D display modes for processing and/or presenting 3-D content based at least in part on received enhanced 2-D content. In an embodiment, the barrier component 108 can be or can com- prise a liquid crystal polarizer (LCP) or prism LCP (PLCP) that can employ, at various times, a specified barrier pattern, of a plurality of available barrier patterns, in a specified bar- rier pattern mode, based at least in part on the type of video content being presented to the viewer. In some implementa- tions, the 3-D video content output from and presented by the barrier component 108 can be viewed by the viewer lens free, that is, without the viewer having to wear 3-D glasses (e.g., 3-D glasses with polarized lens, chromatically opposite lens, or shutter glass).", "type": "Document"}}
