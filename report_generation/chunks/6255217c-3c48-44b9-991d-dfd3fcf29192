For examp a facile electrochemical dep electrode setup. In operation, may be used as a working e le, the electrodeposition may be osition performed with a two- the substrate such as a SS mesh lectrode while a zinc metal foil (purity>99.99%, Suzhou TanFeng Technology Co., Ltd.) may be used as both counter and reference electrodes. An aqueous solution containing for example 1 mol L7! of ZnSO, and 1 mol L7! KCI (AR grade, Sigma) may be used as the electrolyte. The electroplating may be performed at a predetermined current density (e.g. 10 mA cm for a predetermined time (e.g. 1 h) using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D).\n\n[0179] The third crosslinked structure includes a plurality of alginate chains crosslinked together by forming ionic bonds with ionic crosslinking agents such as Zn2+ and/or Mna2+ in the electrolyte. The ionic bonds form when alginate is immersed in an electrolytic solution. Preferably, as shown in FIG. 2C, the bonding site is where the interaction between the guluronic acid units in different alginate chains and the ionic crosslinking agents such as Zn** and/or Mn** to occur, in which the negatively charged carboxyl group of the dissociated acid unit in each of the alginate chain forms ionic bonds with the cation. In addition, as alginate includes multiple guluronic acid units, therefore multiple alginate chains may be crosslinked together with such ionic linkages formed by the cations and the carboxy] groups in each of the alginate chains.", "type": "Document"}}
