The target IncRNA is targeted by a group of gRNAs. The nuclease activity-free RNA nuclease CRISPR/CasRx (dCasRx) fused with engineered biotin ligase (BASU) is recruited to a specific site. After a treatment by biotin, the\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\nadjacent RNA binding protein (RBP) will be biotinylated by BASU. The red shading indicates the marking radius of BASU-dCasRx. Biotinylated proteins are enriched by streptavidin aflinity-coupled magnetic beads (MyOne T1) for subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) identification and Western blot (WB) analysis.\n\n[0043] FIG. 16 shows three groups of gRNAs (highlighted different colors) against the human IncRNA XIST locus. one group of gRNA is expressed in each experiment.\n\nin Only\n\n[0044] FIG. lc shows that CARPID is used to identify XIST-related proteomes. The volcano plot shows the enrich- ment of XIST-related proteins in HEK293T cells. The x-axis represents the log 2 converted value of the protein level fold change in the CARPID results of all three groups of XIST gRNAs compared with the control. The y-axis shows the negative logarithmic converted p-value (non-parametric rank product test). Significantly enriched proteins are marked as orange dots. Proteins previously verified to inter- act with XIST and recognized by CARPID are marked in orange font. The blue font represents SNF2L and TAF15, which are two newly identified XIST-related proteins.", "type": "Document"}}
