The present invention provides a fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx, a mammalian expression vector for expressing said fusion protein. The method for determining the IncRNA interaction protein according to the present invention comprises: co-transfecting a mammalian expression vector that expresses the fusion protein and a gRNA that specifically targets the target lncRNA into target cells, thereby BASU specifically biotin-labeling effector proteins nearby; isolating the biotinylated proteins by using a streptavidin affinity coupled magnetic bead and then eluting, and digesting by trypsin and quantitatively analyz- ing by a label-free mass spectrometry. The present invention can highly credibly determine the proteins that interact with IncRNA.\n\nSpecification includes a Sequence Listing.\n\nPatent Application Publication\n\nNov. 4, 2021 Sheet 1 of 15\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\nASTAS", "type": "Document"}}
