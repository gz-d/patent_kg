The LB solution is then autoclaved for 45 minutes at 121\u00b0 C. and allowed to cool prior to addition of antibiotics.\n\nBacteria are cultured in the LB medium. Before the\n\n[0147]\n\nexperiment, the bacteria containing LB stock solution is diluted with fresh LB medium until the OD,,.,. of the medium reaches 0.005. Then 200 hL of diluted solution is transferred to a sterile 96-well plate. Complexes at the designed concentration are added and the plates are cultured at 37\u00b0 C., rotating at 250 rpm, in an incubation shaker. After 2h, the plates are taken out to irradiate either with or without white light (400-760 nm, 4 mW/cm*) for 10 min, and cultured for another 22 h. Afterwards, 100 hL of the bacterial solution is transferred to a new 96 well plate. The absorption at 600 nm is recorded by a microplate reader (Biotek Powerwave xs Microplate Reader). 100% viability is defined as the ODeoo value of the untreated group, 0%\n\nviability is defined as the medium blank.\n\n[0148] FIGS. 27A-27E show the viability of Escherichia coli (DH5-a) after different treatments. Bacteria were treated with the indicated compounds for 2 hours, then irradiated with white light (400-760 nm, 4 mW/cm?) for 10 min. Finally, the bacteria were cultured for another 22 hours. FIG. 27A shows a graph with the results for Oxaliplatin, FIG. 27B shows a graph with the results for Carboplatin, FIG. 27C shows a graph with the results for compound 3, FIG. 27D shows a graph with the results for Complex 6, and FIG. 27E shows a graph with the results for complex 7.", "type": "Document"}}
