In this example, the feed network 112 is a balun network (balanced to unbalanced feeding network) that transmits an electric signal to the planar dipole antenna 106 and the loop antenna 108. The balun network includes a first conductive strip 112A that provides an input portion for connection with the feed source, and a second conductive strip 112B that provides a phase inverter. As shown in FIG. 1B, the first and second conductive strips 112A, 112B are spaced apart and extend- ing substantially in parallel. The first conductive strip 112A is connected at one end with a microstrip line 120 (50-Ohm in this example), which can be fed by another microstrip line, SMA connector, or other feed sources. The first con- ductive strip 112A is connected with a via 114 that extends through the substrate 104 to connect with the planar dipole antenna 106 and the loop antenna 108. The second conduc- tive strip 112B is connected with vias 116, 118 at opposite ends. The via 116 connects with the planar dipole antenna 106 and the loop antenna 108; the via 118 connects with the generally rectangular conductive patch portion 108E. The eed network 112 can provide a stable phase shift within a\n\n[0067] FIGS. SA and 5B show an alternative embodiment the top and bottom layers 402, 403 of the antenna. The main difference between this embodiment and the embodi- ment of FIGS. 1B and 1C is that the locations of the vias changed.\n\n[0068] FIGS. 6A and 6B show an alternative embodiment of the top and bottom layers 502, 503 of the antenna. The main differences between this embodiment and the embodi- ment of FIGS. 1B and 1C are that: (1) the second conductive strip 112B of the feed network 112 on the top side has been moved to the bottom side, as a conductive strip connected. directly across the loop antenna, and (2) the vias associated with the second conductive strip 112B are no longer present.", "type": "Document"}}
