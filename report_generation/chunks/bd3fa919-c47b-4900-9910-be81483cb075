A disadvantage of linear regulators is low efficiency. Significant power is dissipated within the linear regulator IC, as the converter is constantly on and conducting current. Linear regulators are normally used when the difference between input source voltage and output supply voltage is minimal, and converter efficiency is not a concern.\n\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\n\nAn object of the invention is to provide an improved com- circuit for a voltage or current regulator.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to mitigate or obviate some degree one or more problems associated with known methods of compensating the output signal of a voltage current regulator.\n\nSwitching voltage regulators are commonly used for both step-up and step-down applications, and differ from linear regulators by means of pulse-width modulation (PWM) implementation. Switching regulators control the output volt- age by using a current switch with a constant frequency and variable duty-cycle. Switching frequencies are generally from a few kHz to a few MHz. The switch duty-cycle ratio determines how much and how quickly the output supply voltage increases or decreases, depending on the load state and input source voltage. Some switching regulators utilize both variable switching frequency and duty-cycle.\n\nYet another object of the invention is to provide an output compensator for a voltage or current regulator which does process the whole of the load power of the voltage regulator output signal.", "type": "Document"}}
