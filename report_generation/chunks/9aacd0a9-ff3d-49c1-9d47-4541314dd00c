They present different kinds of video sequences respectively: Akiyo (slow motion), Foreman and Container (medium motion), Stefan (high motion). The experiments were carried out in the JVT JM 8.3 encoder. Test parameters are listed below:\n\n(EQUATION 26)\n\nwhere total_zeros and total_coeff present the number of zeros and the number of non-zero coefficients respectively after quantization. SAD is the sum of absolute value of quan- tized transform coefficients. The experiences values of a and Pare 1 and 3. Experimental results are listed in the tables in FIGS. 23 to 26. From the results, the reduction of encoding time was about 30% to 40% with ignorable performance degradation. This indicates that the proposed FSSD algorithm can be easily combined with other fast H.264/AVC algo- rithms and achieves a good tradeoff between computation complexity and rate-distortion performance.\n\nTest condition:\n\nRate Distortion Optimization is enabled;\n\nCAVLC is enabled;\n\nGOP structure is IPPPIPPP;\n\nQP values are 28, 32, 36 and\n\nThe percentage of reduced time of calculating distortion is defined as:\n\nWhat is claimed is:\n\ncalculating sum squared between an original block S and a reconstructed block R of image or video data, the method comprising the steps of:\n\nTorgror ~ T proposed TOT (EQUATION 25) x 100% Torgror \u00b0 ATssp =\n\ncomputing a processor a predicted corre- sponding to the original block S, using inter or intra frame prediction,", "type": "Document"}}
