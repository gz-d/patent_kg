The dependent variables were the accuracy and the response time of the stimulus. The order of the two stimuli sets (.e., left ear, and right ear) was presented in the Latin-Square coun- ter-balanced order, resulting in two sessions for each par- ticipant. The stimuli within each set were presented thrice in a randomized order, so there were (12 on the left ear+12 on the night ear) patterns with 3 repetitions=72 trials for each participant. There was a 7-second gap between two con-\n\nUS 2023/0122309 Al\n\nsecutive cues, and a 5-minute break after one set of stimuli. Each participant went through the procedure of training and testing similar to Study 1.\n\n[0095] Results: Accuracy & Response Time\n\nrepeated\n\nmulti-factorial\n\n[0096]\n\nAccuracy.\n\nA\n\nmeasures\n\nANOVA was performed on the accuracy of recognizing the one-ear thermal patterns. The results showed that there was a significant effect of the type of pattern (F(5,55)=16.19, p<0.0005, n2=0.595), but no significant effect of the ear side or the direction of temperature changing. Post-hoc pairwise comparison showed that 1h3h and 3h4h yielded significantly higher accuracy than the other hot patterns on the left side (p<=0.0045), and so did 5h7h and 7h8h on the right side (p<=0.032). Similar results were found in the cold stimuli, with lc3c and 3c4c being significantly more accurate on the left side, and Sc7c and 7c8c yielding significantly higher accuracy on the right side. FIGS. 10a and 106 depict the average accuracy of stimuli identification for each pattern on the left and the nght ears. FIGS. 1la and 115 show the confusion tables for the left and the right sides respectively.\n\n[0097] Response Time.", "type": "Document"}}
