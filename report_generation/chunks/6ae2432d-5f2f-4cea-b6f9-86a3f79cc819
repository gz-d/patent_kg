This means that the valance electrons are more localized to the Ni and O atoms, which makes it harder for the O-2p electrons to compensate the oxidation of Ni ions. In this regard, the repulsion between O\u2014O can be maintained at a higher voltage, so that the H2-H3 phase transition is delayed. In addition, the H1-H2 phase transition in layered materials is induced by the rearrangement of the Li vacancies from order to disorder upon delithiation. The distorted octahedra, similar to the effect of dopants, could disturb the periodic potential walls by altering TM-TM interactions, which breaks the Li-vacancy ordering. Thus, the H1-H2 phase transition is replaced by a moderate solid-solution reaction.\n\n[0057] It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications besides those already described are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein. The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the disclosure. Moreover, in interpreting the disclosure, all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the context. In particular, the terms \u201cincludes\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, \u201ccomprises\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d should be interpreted as referring to elements, components, or steps in a non-exclusive manner, indicating that the referenced elements, components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or combined with other elements, components, or steps that are not expressly refer- enced.\n\n1.
