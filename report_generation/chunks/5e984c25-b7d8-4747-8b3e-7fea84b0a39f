BASU is subcloned from BASU RaPID plasmid (Addgene #107250), and cloned into EFla-dCasRx-2A- EGFP plasmid (Addgene #109050) in frame. LTR, long terminal repeat; T2A, self-cleaving peptide; eGFP, enhanced GFP.\n\n[0065] FIG. 4c shows the transfection of HEK293T cells with BASU-dCasRx or dCasRx-BASU. After 48 hours, the cells are treated with 200 HM biotin for the specified time. Immunoblotting experiments are performed on whole cel. lysates using streptavidin chelating HRP. The experiment is carried out in 3 biological replicates, and representative results are shown).\n\n[0066] FIG. 4d is a scatter plot showing the comparison 0: gene expression levels in wild-type HEK293T cells or\n\nin\n\no:\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\nHEK293T cells transfected with different gRNAs (XIST- L1/XIST-L2/XIST-L3). The x-axis in each figure represents the log 2 converted gene expression level in wild-type HEK293T cells. The y-axis represents the log 2 converte: gene expression level of HEK293T cells transfected with gRNA in the CARPID experiment. Each figure indicates the expression level of XIST gene.\n\n[0067] FIG. 4e shows the specificity of the CRISPR/ CasRx system on XIST. HEK293T cells are co-transfected with CasRx and single gRNA (empty vector control, XIST- L1, XIST-L2 and XIST-L3). Total RNA is extracted from the treated cells and then subjected to reverse transcription and qPCR analysis to quantify the level of XIST specific sites. GADPH is used to normalize the level of XIST. Please note that the co-transfection with CasRx and gRNA specifically reduces the RNA transcription level at its target locus.
