In an aspect, the high-side portion and low-side portion of the DGD subsystem can be symmetrical. The six SDGD com- ponents 2014 through 2024 (e.g., self-driven gate-drive cir- cuits) can be designed such that they consumea relatively low amount of power and do not require an extra or separate power supply in order to operate, as power to drive the six DGD 2014 through 2024 be supplied by the wn wn\n\nTurning to FIG. 21, depicted is an example circuit diagram ofa system 2100 that can comprise a multi-phase (e.g., three- phase) SDSR that can be employed to receive and synchro- nously rectify a multi-phase AC power signal and produce a desired DC signal as an output, in accordance with another embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. In an aspect, the system 2100 can include six switches, switch 2102, switch 2104, switch 2106, switch 2108, switch 2110, and switch 2112, which can be configured in system 2100 as shown in\n\nreplacement of the diode rectifier module.
