For example, wind farms, solar thermal concentrators, photovoltaic enhancements, and other renewable energy projects have received increasing attention from governments, manufactur- ers, and consumers alike. Whether renewable energy is viewed as a more cost effective way to power modern devices in the face of energy price risk, or whether it is viewed as a way of more socially responsible or \u201cgreen\u201d living, renewable energy sources are targeted to an increasing array of facets of modern life.\n\nIn yet situations, a potential user either power generation or wireless communication can oth- erwise prevent establishment of wireless communication sys- tems without expensive power systems being developed to power such communication systems. For example, in a remote wireless sensor network such as a tsunami warning system, for example, the remote monitoring of seismological and tidal stations across a vast expanse of an ocean basin can require remote installations where it would not be economi- cally feasible to establish conventional power generation sys- tems or even large scale renewable energy generation sys-\n\nFor instance, with the promotion of a green environment or green living, it is of increasing interest to utilize renewable energy in modern wireless systems. In conventional solar power generation plants, solar cells are typically used with reflectors to improve the light-power utilization. For instance, a parabolic trough can be used as a solar reflectors to redirect sunlight to solar cells to increase the light intensity at the solar cells, and thus, a smaller number of photovoltaic cells are used for a given power demand.", "type": "Document"}}
