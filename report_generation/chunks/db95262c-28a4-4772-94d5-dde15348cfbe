The one or more processors may be arranged on the same apparatus, or arranged distributively on a computing net- work.\n\n[0019] In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided an article including the computer readable medium of the second aspect.\n\n[0020] In accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program product storing instructions and/or data that are executable by one or more processors, the instructions and/or data are arranged to cause the one or more processors to perform the method of the first aspect.\n\nIn accordance with\n\nfifth\n\nof the\n\n[0021] a aspect invention, there is provided a system for determining flow speed based. on photoacoustic imaging or sensing. The system includes one or more processors arranged to: receive multiple pho- toacoustic signals (e.g., a first photoacoustic signal and a second photoacoustic signal) from a sample in response to transmission of multiple laser pulses (e.g., a first laser pulse and a second laser pulse) to the sample, the first pulse laser has a first wavelength and the second laser pulse has a second wavelength different from the first wavelength, e.g., from the same laser source; and process the first photoa- coustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a flow model that relates photoacoustic signals with flow speed to determine a flow speed of a liquid flow in the sample. The model may be stored in a memory operably\n\nconnected with the one or more processors.", "type": "Document"}}
