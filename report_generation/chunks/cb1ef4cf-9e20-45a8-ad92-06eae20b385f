H.264/AVC greatly outperforms the previous MPEG-1/2/4 and H.261/263 standards in terms of both pic- ture quality and compression efficiency. In some implemen- tations it may provide the same picture quality as DVD (or MPEG-2) video while only consuming about 25% of the storage space and its bit-rate is about half of that of the MPEG-4 advanced simple profile. To achieve this superior coding performance, H.264/AVC adopts many advanced techniques, such as directional spatial prediction for intra frame coding, variable and hierarchical block transform, arithmetic entropy coding, multiple reference frame motion compensation, deblocking, etc. It also uses 7 different block sizes for motion-compensation in the inter mode, and 3 dif- ferent block sizes with various spatial directional prediction modes in the intra mode. The main critical process employed is the rate-distortion optimized mode decision technique which provides H.264/AVC much better coding performance in terms of compression efficiency and visual quality. To select the best macroblock coding mode, an H.264/AVC encoder needs to compute the rate-distortion cost of all pos- sible modes, which involves computation of integer trans- form, quantization, variable length coding and pixel recon- struction processes. All of this processing explains the high computational complexity of rate-distortion cost calculation. Hence, the cost function computation makes H.264/AVC\n\nCalculate the R-D cost: Jp=SSD(S,C)+ \u548c \u6709\n\n2.1 Differential-Domain SSD\n\nMathematically, the original block S and reconstructed block C can be expressed as:\n\nS=D+P\n\nEQUATION (10)\n\nC=D4P\n\nEQUATION (11)", "type": "Document"}}
