The audio processing system of claim 8, wherein the signal output comprises a cochlear implant.\n\n10. The audio processing system of claim 8, further including a second input device and a second processor, wherein the second processor is electrically connected to the first processor, the audio source and the signal output, and the second input device is electrically connected to the second processor, and the second input device is configured to generate a second controlling signal to the second pro- cessor, and the second processor adjusts enhancement weights of a vocal group and an instrumental group of the first audio signal based on the second controlling signal and the hearing profile.\n\nWhat is claimed is:\n\n1. A method for processing audio signals comprising:\n\nextracting a fundamental frequency (FO) component from a first audio signal;\n\nprocessing the first audio signal with Dominant Melody Enhancement (DoME) based on a hearing profile to generate a second audio signal; and\n\n65\n\n11. The audio processing system of claim 8, wherein the signal output includes one or more dominant electrodes, and the first processor enhances stimulations by the dominant electrodes through the second audio signal, and the domi- nant electrodes are corresponded to signals range from approximately 212 Hz to 1.4 kHz.\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\n11\n\n12. The audio processing\n\nof claim 8, wherein the\n\nsystem hearing profile comprises one or more settings for enhancing or reducing existing features of the first audio signal, and settings for synthesizing new features based on characteris- tics of the first audio signal and user calibration.\n\n13. An audio processing system, including:\n\nan audio source;\n\nan acoustic device; and\n\na first processor electrically connected the audio source and the acoustic device;", "type": "Document"}}
