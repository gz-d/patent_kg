The inventors found that urei- dopyrimidinone end-caps form strong quadruple hydrogen onds that promote chain extension, particularly linear chain extension, and facilitate monomeric properties, and weaker hydrogen bonds between the urea, ic. NH,CONH,, also provide intermolecular crosslinks between the one or more monomeric unit backbone. The inventors also found that the ureidopyrimidinone end-caps of the monomeric units can be associated and disassociated under certain stimuli that advantageously provide the composition with self-assembly when\n\n[0096] R, and R, are independently selected from the group consisting of (i) a linear or branched alkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; and (ii) a cycloalkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom.
