In this embodiment, in plan view, the two oscillators are generally symmetrically disposed about an axis of reflection symmetry, which cor- responds to an axis that bisects each of the two patch elements 404A, 404B (ie., a vertical axis in FIG. 4A).\n\n[0164]\n\nIn\n\nthe\n\nembodiment,\n\nterminals\n\nof\n\ngate\n\none\n\ntransistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are connected to the horizontal coupling network (of even- mode-shorted couplers, intra unit cell or inter unit cells) for out-of-phase oscillation/coupling mode. In one embodiment, the source terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are connected to the vertical coupling network (of odd-mode-shorted couplers, inter unit cells) for in-phase oscillation/coupling mode. In one embodiment, the source terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are separately con- nected to respective parallel capacitor for optimum oscilla- tion state and respective curved transmission line for DC supply. In one embodiment, the drain terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B are separately respectively connected to transmission line with AC short termination. In one embodiment, the DC supply voltage Vp for the drain terminal is fed from the AC short termination. In one embodiment, the capacitively-fed patch antenna arrangement, in particular patch elements 404A, 404B, is operably coupled with the drain terminals of the transistor pairs of the transistor arrangements 402A,\n\n402B for selectively radiating the third harmonic power.\n\nof\n\n[0165] FIG. 4B shows illustrate some example dimensions the unit cell 400 in one embodiment.", "type": "Document"}}
