The recombinant vector is then inserted into a cell for example through infection. The transcription of the recombinant vector allows the transcription of the foreign nucleic acid and thus may result in expression of the foreign nucleic acid. A person skilled in the art would appreciate suitable methods for introducing the recombinant vector into a cell for infection.\n\nThe invention is now described in the following non- limiting examples.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nby mutagenesis approach using overlapping PCR primers that contain desired mutant bases to amplify the wild-type pro- tein encoding DNA sequence, and cloned into expression vector. To compare the effect of wild-type and mutant proteins in nuclease activity, the GUIDE-seq (genome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing) was used. Briefly, double-stranded oligo deoxyribonucleotides (dsODNs) were co-delivered with Cas9 and target guide (sgRNA)-expressing plasmid(s) into target cells. Following the Cas9 gene editing that introduced double strand breaks in on- and off-targets of the genome, the dsODNs were randomly integrated into the breaks (DSBs). DNA was extracted from the cells, and sequencing libraries were prepared by enriching the dsODNs and their flanking sequences and used for next-generation sequencing. The resulting number of reads is proportional to the DSB events occurred during the experiment, and the read sequences were aligned to a reference genome to identify", "type": "Document"}}
