Let us label the maximum power and mini\n\nUS 8,482,214 B2\n\n7\n\n8\n\neffective in low-frequency operation. The LED load could be an LED array or multiple arrays in modular forms. Various valley-fill circuits or their improved versions can be used to improve the input power factor. In embodiments of this inven- tion, non-electrolytic capacitors can be used in the valley-fill circuit and current-ripple cancellation circuit. Either a stan- dard valley-fill circuit, a valley-fill circuit with voltage dou- bler or any variant of the valley-fill circuit can be used in this invention.\n\nmum power of the LED load as Pmax and Pmin, respectively in FIG, 3(a). It has been shown that the relationship of the luminous flux and the power of a LED system follows an asymmetric parabolic curve as shown in FIG. 3(6) [Hui S. Y. R. and Qin Y. X., \u201cGeneral photo-electro-thermal theory for light-emitting diodes (LED) systems\u201d, IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference, February 2009, Washington D.C., USA, paper 16.2; U.S. Ser. No. 12/370,101 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference]. Ifthe LED sys- tem is designed such that Pmax and Pmin enclose the peak region of the luminous flux\u2014LED power curve where the slope of the curve is minimum as shown in FIG. 3(d), a significant variation of LED power (AP, ;)) will only lead to a relatively small variation in the luminous flux (Ag,). An alternative is to design the LED thermal design so that P,,,.. and P,,,,,, fall within a region of the luminous flux\u2014LED power curve where the slope of the curve is relatively small (i.e. near the peak value) as shown in FIG. 3(c).", "type": "Document"}}
