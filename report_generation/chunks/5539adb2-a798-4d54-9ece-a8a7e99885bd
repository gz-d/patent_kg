Amicroscopy device is configured to obtain image data of the whole cell 116 captured in the microfluidic channel 118. Each microfluidic channel 118 has a linear confined shape, an inlet 120 configured to receive the cell and an outlet 122 in fluid communication with the inlet 120. The microfluidic channel 116 has a varying width configured to deform the cell to multiple deformation levels. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1B, the microfluidic channel 118 tapers from the inlet 120 towards the outlet 122 such that the width decreases at a consistent rate from its inlet W,,, to its outlet W,,,,. W,, should be large enough to cover the size range of the whole cell 116, whereas W,,,, should be small enough to capture the extracted cell nuclei of the whole cell 116. In an embodiment, the inlet 120 has a width of 10 hm-s0 hm and the outlet 122 has a width of 1 um-10 wm. A cell or nucleus deforms at a continually increasing rate along the microfluidic channel 118 due to the reducing width of the\n\nmicrofluidic channel 118.\n\n[0064] The microfluidic channel 118 has a taper angle 6 that reflects the rate of change of the width of the micro-\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\nfluidic channel 118 along the microfluidic channel length Lo, direction.
