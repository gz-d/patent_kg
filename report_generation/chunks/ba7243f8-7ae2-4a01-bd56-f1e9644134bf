Consequently, curcumin nanoparticles are formed inside the pores of the ice.\n\n[0063] The ice templates, infused with the drug now, in a freezer of minus 20 degrees Celsius for another to age the nanoparticles.\n\nput hours\n\n[0064] Eventually, the ice templates were left to melt separately in room temperature. Sonication is applied as the templates melt. Aqueous colloidal suspensions of the nanodrug were thereby obtained.\n\nice\n\n[0065] The particle size distribution of curcumin obtained by the difference ice templates are shown in FIGS. 10 to 14, along with SEM photographs shown the nanoparticles. A picture of a vial of nanodrug colloidal dispersion is shown as an inset in FIG. 124.\n\n[0066] FIG. 10 shows the polydispersity index (PDI) of the curcumin nanoparticles prepared by using a Cur-THF solution (curcumin dissolved in tetrahydrofuran) of 1 mg/ml. The particle size distribution of the nanodrug obtained in in the beaker is shown as FIG. 10a, i.e. template- 1, and the corresponding SEM image is shown in FIG. 10c, ie, Cur-1.\n\n[0067] The particle size distribution of the nanodrug obtained in in the 24-well microplate 101 is shown as FIG. 104, i.e. template-2, and the corresponding SEM image shown in FIG. 10d, i.e. Cur-2.\n\n[0068] It can be seen in FIG. 104 that the particle size of the Cur-2 nanodrug, obtained by using current new method, is significantly smaller than the Cur-1 nanoparticles made by the beaker ice template method seen in FIG. 10a. That is, the size of Cur-2 is smaller at 22.9 nm at a PDI of 0.112, while the size of Cur-1 is 25.7 nm on the average with a PDI of 0.259.\n\n[0069] As may be seen in all the data and pictures shown FIG. 10 to FIG. 14, the better PDI of prepared nanodrug were obtained in all groups using the modified template-2, the 24-well microplate 101.\n\nin\n\ni.e,", "type": "Document"}}
