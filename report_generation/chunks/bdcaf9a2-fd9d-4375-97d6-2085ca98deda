As such, the COF in the present embodiment may be used in gas separation and storage, heterogeneous catalysis, chemical sensing, luminescence, electronic devices, drug delivery, and energy storage and conversion.\n\n[0044] As used herein, an \u201caromatic moiety\u201d includes any of substituted or unsubstituted C3_, cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C,_, cycloalkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted 3 to 8 membered heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubsti- tuted 3 to 8 membered heterocycloalkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted Ce.io aryl, substituted or unsubstituted C,_,, aralkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or heteroatoms. Preferably, the aromatic moiety includes at least one carbonyl group, e.g., a benzo- quinone moiety with two carbonyl groups, such as o-ben- zoquinone, p-benzoquinone and the like.\n\n[0045] A \u201cthioether linkage\u201d refers to the covalent linkage connecting the building blocks including a R\u2014S\u2014R' bond where R is one of the aromatic moieties and R' is the adjacent aromatic moiety or a functional group that is connected to the adjacent aromatic moiety. A \u201cdithioether linkage\u201d means two thioether linkages, i.e., there are two said R\u2014S\u2014R' bonds connected between the pair of aro- matic moieties. The functional group for R' may be any of\n\nMar. 7, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
