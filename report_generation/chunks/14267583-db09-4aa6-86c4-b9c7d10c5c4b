The SEM images intuitively showed that the MnO, comprises a highly porous structure of interconnected nanoflakes (FIG. 13C). As depicted in the TEM images (FIG. 13D), the porous MnO, nanoflakes are polycrystalline consisting of nanograins with asize of approximately 10 nm. The SEM image of Zn anode, as given in FIG. 13E, showed that the electroplated zine on the SS mesh existed as uniform porous nanosheet structure, which may facilitate the interfacial compatibility of elec- trode-electrolyte and enable a fast charge\n\n[0218] In order to measure the ionic conductivity of the AD-gel electrolyte, two plates of stainless steel were wrapped into the AD-gel electrolyte before the elastomer coating process. As shown in FIG. 12A, the ionic conduc- tivity of AD-gel electrolyte containing 2 mol L~* of ZnSO, and 0.1 mol L~! of MnSO, was calculated to be 16.3 mS cem\u2122', which was comparable to other ionic conducting polyelectrolytes with zinc ion as shown in Table 1 below.\n\n[0223] The inventors devise that many of the existing flexible electrical energy storage devices are of a sand- wiched structure that includes two electrodes that sand- wiches a layer of electrolyte. In such relatively simple structure, water molecules may easily evaporate from the exposed part of hydrogel electrolyte, or through the elec- trodes which may employ a carbon cloth as a current collector.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTonic conductivity of AD-gel electrolyte and various zine salts-containing polyelectrolytes.
