The ring body includes a top insulating layer, a bottom insulating layer, and an intermediate insulating layer disposed in between the top and the bottom insulating layers. The detector includes a receiving electrode layer disposed in between the top and the intermediate insulating layers, a transmitting electrode layer disposed in between the inter- diate and the bottom insulating 1 1 1 \u548c electrode layer embedding in the bottom insulating layer and electrically coupled to an electrical ground. The receiving electrode layer has a plurality of receiving electrode portions separated from each other and arranged in a matrix and along a curve path. The interactive wearable device is configured to analyze the movement event at least according to a variation of a data set in response to the movement\n\n, GO6F 3/014 GOGF 3/0236 GO06V 40/1365 382/124 6,859,141 Bl 2/2005 Van Schyndel et al. 10,139,906 BL* 11/2018 Bai .. 10,310,632 B2* 6/2019 Nirjon . 2016/0034742 Al* 2/2016 Kim .\n\nevent, measured by receiving electrode portions.\n\n19 Claims, 18 Drawing Sheets\n\n\u548c\n\n\u4e0a\n\nUS 11,822,732 BT\n\nPage 2\n\n(56) References Cited\n\nOTHER PUBLICATIONS\n\nDenys JC Matthies et al.
