This allows the determination of temporal dynamics of eye movements in terms of ROIs and transitions among ROIs specific to an individual.\n\nAdvantageously, the novel methods of the instant invention detect multiple cognitive states that occur during a task and the eye movement pattern associated with each cognitive state; thus allowing a better understanding of individual differences in eye movement patterns in real-life complicated cognitive tasks and predicting cognitive states from eye movement patterns.\n\nIn some embodiments, the instant invention provides switching HMMs (SHMMss) that are hierarchical HMMs with two layers containing a high-level HMM and several low-level HMMs. Each low-level HMM can be used to learn the eye movement pattern of a cognitive state. The high-level HMM acts like a \u2018switch\u2019 that captures the transitions between cognitive states. It does so by learning the transitions between the low-level HMMs.\n\nThe SHMMs of the instant invention are used to model transitions between cognitive states and their associated eye movement patterns in a cognitive task.\n\nIn some embodiments, the high-level states represent the cognitive states, whereas the low-level states correspond to ROIs over the stimul1.", "type": "Document"}}
