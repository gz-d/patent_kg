The system and method of the invention is not limited to the use of such \u201coriginal video\u201d, but any \u201creference video\u201d that is a video, preferably coloured, either the source or with some compression dis- tortion, and either at the real views or the virtual views. In the experiment validation presented above, the reference video is selected as the captured source colour video at the virtual viewpoint of synthesized videos, i.e., the original video at virtual viewpoint, for illustration purpose only. Generally, the reference video is input to video quality predictor. And the predictor is to predict the quality of the synthesized video with respect to the reference video, which can be either the source captured video without distortion or with some compression distortions.", "type": "Document"}}
