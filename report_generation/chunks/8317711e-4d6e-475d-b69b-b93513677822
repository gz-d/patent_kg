FIG. 2A shows a top view and FIG. 2B shows a perspective view. The thermoelectric device 200 functions to generate electricity in response to being exposed to heat or a temperature gradient. The ther- moelectric device 200 of FIGS. 2A and 2B is similar in construction to the thermoelectric device 100 shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. The thermoelectric device 200 comprises an array of thermoelectric modules. As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the thermoelectric device 200 comprises multiple rows of thermoelectric modules disposed on a flexible substrate 202. The flexible substrate is a sheet of flexible material. The flexible substrate 202 may, in one example construction be a polyimide sheet. Alternatively, the sub- strate may be formed from any other suitable material similar to substrate 102.\n\n[0150] Each p type semiconductor element 112 and each n type semiconductor element 114 is coupled to two conductor members 116, wherein each end of each semiconductor element is coupled to a separate conductor member. As seen in FIGS. 1A and 1B, each semiconductor element is coupled to a conductor member at each end of the semiconductor element. The conductor members extend in opposing direc- tion from a single semiconductor element. In the illustrated configuration the thermoelectric device 100 comprises N number of semiconductor elements in total (Le. the sum of p type semiconductor elements 112 and n type semiconduc- tor elements 114) and the device 100 comprises N+1 con- ductor members. In the illustrated example of FIG. 1A and 1B, the device 100 comprises 8 semiconductor elements. The device 100 comprises 4 thermoelectric modules. The device 100 comprises 9 conductor elements.", "type": "Document"}}
