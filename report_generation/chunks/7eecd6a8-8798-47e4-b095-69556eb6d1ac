For simplicity the sub- strate is not shown. As shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, the antenna array include multiple planar complementary wide- band antennas of like construction as that of FIGS. 1A to 1C. These planar complementary wideband antennas are con- nected to a common input 1200, and to a common ground plane 1300. In this embodiment, the antennas too are arranged in a 1x4 array structure.\n\n[0077] For example, the antenna array can be formed with different number of planar complementary antennas. The planar complementary antennas can be of different form, size, shape, and configuration. The antenna array is particu- larly adapted for (but not limited to) operation at GHz and THz frequencies.\n\n[0073] FIGS. 11A and 11B show an alternative embodi- ment of the top and bottom layers 1102, 1103 of the antenna. The main difference between this embodiment and the embodiment of FIGS. 1B and 1C is that in this embodiment the dipole antenna is formed on the top layer and connected with the feed network on the top layer. In other words, the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna are arranged on opposite sides of the substrate.\n\n[0078] The planar complementary antenna and related antenna array may be formed from a PCB substrate using, conventional PCB fabrication techniques.\n\n1.
