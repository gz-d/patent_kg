The primary windings may be connected in series and/or in parallel. The windings may be circular, rectangular, square or polygonal spirals.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nmultiple layers of such arrays may be provided, with the array in one layer being offset relative to the array in another layer such that regions of one layer that generate maximum flux coincide with regions of another later that generate minimum flux.\n\nThe present invention is particularly well suited in a preferred embodiment for realisation as an induction heating apparatus, and the primary induction unit may be an induction cooker, with the secondary element(s) being one or more metallic cooking utensils.\n\nViewed from another broad aspect the present invention provides apparatus for the transfer of energy by electrical induction comprising a primary induction unit formed with a planar surface for receiving at least one secondary element to which energy is to be transferred, wherein said at least one secondary element may be located anywhere on said planar surface and energy is only transferred from said primary induction unit in the area of said surface where the said at least secondary element is located.\n\nViewed from another broad aspect the present invention provides apparatus for generating substantially uniform magnetic flux over a surface, comprising at least two layers each being formed with an array of primary electrical windings, wherein the array of a first said layer is offset relative to the array of a second said layer such that regions of said first layer that generate maximum magnetic flux coincide with regions of said second layer that generate minimum magnetic flux.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
