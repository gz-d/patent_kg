The input resistance of the antenna loo can\n\nbe controlled by varying the width Lz of strip 112A .\n\nwith opposite ends that are close but spaced apart . The\n\nloop - like portion includes two generally parallel long sides\n\n[ 0063 ] The Table below shows exemplary dimensions ( in\n\nmm and as wavelength fractions ) for the antenna structures\n\nand two generally parallel short sides . The short sides are\n\ngenerally perpendicular to the long sides .
