Spe- cifically, the protein with more than one peptide includes human keratin. The specific analysis process comprises: normalizing and logarithmizing a LFQ abundance of each group; replacing a missing value by a minimum value representing the detection limits of mass spectrometer; determining the protein that is statistically enriched in samples of the gRNA transfection group compared to the control group transfected with gRNA empty vectors by ranl product; a protein with the adjusted p-values0.05 and the abundance changez2 folds, is identified as RBP to the target\n\nIncRNA.\n\n[0034] In some specific embodiments of the present inven- tion, CARPID is applied to three IncRNAs, namely XIST, DANCR and MALAT1, in the present invention, and reli- ably recognizes their known interaction proteins. It is worth noting that these three groups of interaction proteins have almost no overlap, showing the strong specificity of the method of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
