This result suggests that the maximum spreading area is insensitive to the surface charges on PTFE film.\n\nCircuit analysis\n\n10\n\n15\n\nand device from the circuit perspective\u2019.\n\nIn this\n\ndiscuss the entire\n\nsection, we droplet a droplet spreads on the PTFE surface loaded with sufficient negative charges, the base contact area with the PTFE dynamically varies as a function of time. A capacitor Cp is formed with the water/PTFE as the top plate and PTFE/ITO as the bottom plate, respectively. For a specific water/PTFE contact area, the voltage across the capacitor can be expressed as do,/e\u00e9,, where Op, Ep and d are the surface charge density, the dielectric constant and the thickness of the PTFE, respectively. At the water/PTFE interface, there exists an additional capacitor, C;. Prior to the contact of the impinging droplet with the drain electrode, there is no capacitor formed at the water/drain interface. As a result, Cp and C; stay in an open-circuit and there is no charge flow between them (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In contrast, with the connection of the drain electrode and PTFE rendered by the gating liquid (switching-on mode), the other capacitor C2 is established at the water/drain interface. Thus, C7, together with Cp and C;, form a close-circuit. In this circuit, the time dependent capacitance of Cp, C; and Cz and can be expressed as Coy = Oe\n\nWhen", "type": "Document"}}
