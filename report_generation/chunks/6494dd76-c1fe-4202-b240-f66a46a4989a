The SAN 10 is washed via sonication sequentially in acetone, ethanol, and water, each for 15 minutes. Afier dried under a steam of nitrogen, the SAN is used as the working electrode of the electro- chemical cell. On the other hand, a platinum wire acts as the counter electrode and a silver/silver sulfate electrode acts as the reference electrode respectively. The electrolyte is an aqueous solution of 0.1 M nitric acid.\n\n[0068] In one alternative embodiment, citric acid is added into electrolyte as additive while the other experimental conditions in the previous example embodiment remained unchanged, nanoparticles 24 of the structured metallic layer 20 formed by electrolyte without additive and nanoparticles 25 of the structured metallic layer 20 formed by electrolyte with additive are depicted in FIGS. 2a and 25 respectively, with scale bars indicate 2 hm for the low magnification images and 500 nm for insets respectively. Comparing the size distribution chart depicted in FIGS. 2c and 2d, the average size of silver particles 22 is reduced from 310 nm (size of nanoparticles 24) to 75 nm (size of nanoparticles 25) with relative standard error dropped from 27.1 to 13.5%.\n\n[0062] A voltage/current waveform is then applied to the electrochemical cell throughout the electrochemical process.\n\n34\n\nMay 6 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0130973 A1\n\n4\n\nmentally friendly and amendable to mass production , which\n\nThus , the particle size of the nanostructure 22 can be\n\nhold great potential for fundamental investigation and prac\n\nmanipulated by the relative content of the additive within the\n\ntical applications .\n\nelectrolyte .\n\n[ 0077 ] Some technical advantages of the embodiments of\n\n[ 0069 ] The dimensions and aggregates status of the nano\n\nthe present invention include :", "type": "Document"}}
