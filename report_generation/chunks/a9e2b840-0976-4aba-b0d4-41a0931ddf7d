In still another aspect, the barrier component 500 can include a selector component 512 that can select items, such as the identified specified display mode, specified barrier pattern and/or specified barrier pattern mode, for example. In yet another aspect, the barrier component 500 can contain a mapper component 514 that can generate and/or contain a mapping of respective control signals to other items, such as respective barrier patterns, respective barrier pattern modes, respective display modes, etc., which can be utilized to facili- tate identifying a desired display mode, barrier pattern and/or barrier pattern mode for use in processing and presenting video disclosed herein.\n\nin an aspect, the barrier component 500 can include a switch component 516 that can control switching (e.g., auto- matically or dynamically in real time) of barrier patterns and barrier pattern modes, and/or corresponding display modes, in accordance with (e.g., in response to) the detected control signal and video content being presented by the projector screen component. The barrier component 500 can further comprise a display mode component 518 that can comprise a plurality of available display modes (e.g., normal 2-D display mode, 3-D stereoscopic display mode, 3-D autostereoscopic display mode) that can correspond to respective barrier pat- terns and barrier pattern modes that can be employed by the barrier component 500, as more fully disclosed herein.", "type": "Document"}}
