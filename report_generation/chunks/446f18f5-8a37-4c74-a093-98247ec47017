RNA in isolated exosomes (Exosome) or whole cell lysate (Cell Lysate), expressed as an equivalent amount of total RNA. The p-value is calculated using the unpaired student\u2019s t-test. Note that DANCR is enriched in exosomes relative to whole cell lysates.\n\n[0095] FIG. 11d shows the comparison of XIST levels in HEK293T whole cell lysate and exosomes. Total RNA is extracted from whole cell lysates and exosomes. Then, the same amount of RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA for the following qPCR analysis. XIST: P1/P2 represents two different sets of gPCR primers used for XIST detection. The value is calculated using the unpaired Student\u2019s t test.\n\n[0096] FIGS. 12a to 12b show the CARPID results of MALATI, wherein:", "type": "Document"}}
