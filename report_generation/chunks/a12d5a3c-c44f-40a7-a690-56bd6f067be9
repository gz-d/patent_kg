These tests were repeated three times for each group.\n\nExample 6 \u4e00 Electric Cells Migration Experiments\n\n[0170]\n\nC2C12 cells was used to evaluate the cell migration\n\nwith electrical stimuli. The Au electrodes with the diameter of 0.5 cm were coated on a cell culture dish (60 mm), and the distance of two electrodes was 0.5 cm. The dishes coated with electrodes was sterilized by 75% ethanol immersing for h followed by ultraviolet irradiation for lh. Then, C2C12 cells were seeded in the dish at a density of 10,000/cm* and cultured with the same complete medium as NIH 3T3 cells or 2 days to obtain the cell monolayer. A scratch line was created on the cell monolayer between the two electrodes by using a 200 HL yellow pipette gun tip. The Au electrodes of the dish were subsequently connected to a generator which output voltage with the same amplitude and frequency as wireless electric stimulators. After electrical stimulation for h, an inverted optical microscope (Nikon) was used to observe the cell migration behavior. For control group, no electric stimulation was applied for C2C12 cell migration. The time spots were set at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after scratching. Each group was repeated three times, and the scratch area was quantified and analyzed by ImageJ soft-\n\nware.\n\nExample 7\u2014Surgical Procedures for Implantation and Electrostimulation\n\nAll procedures associated with the animal studies\n\n[0171]", "type": "Document"}}
