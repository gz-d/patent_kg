This will include stand-alone computers, network computers, dedicated or non-dedicated hardware devices. Where the terms \u201ccomputing system\u201d and \u201ccom- puting device\u201d are used, these terms are intended to include any appropriate arrangement of computer or information processing hardware capable of implementing the function described.\n\n[0046] The above embodiments of the invention provides a simple and computation eflicient means to control the deflector in the microscope to reduce image distortion. The control can be affected in real-time, and does not require specific calibration with specific specimen samples. The use of some of the equations readily simplifies the processing and control of the deflector.\n\n[0047] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention\n\n[0041]\n\nsignal\n\ncan\n\n[0043] Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a schematic diagram of an exemplary information handling system 300\n\nsolid state drives, hard disk drives, optical drives, flash drives, and/or magnetic tape drives.
