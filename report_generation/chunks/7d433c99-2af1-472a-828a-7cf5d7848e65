Based on systematic experiments and simulation, the inven- tors demonstrate that when the mechanical property of the elastomer is dynamically changed in a certain way, it is possible to control the formation and configuration of cracks in an elastomer, and use it as a mold to realize faithful replication of 3D hierarchical structures. The inventors investigated the mechanic and geometric effects on the crack formation and the critical forces to manipulate the elastic cracks, thus, providing general guides for the master design and the material options. With the full understanding of the physics of elastic cracks, the inventors have created novel functions in fabrication with previously strictly avoided cracking phenomenon. Notably, the replication of 3D hier- archical structures using configurable cracks has never been", "type": "Document"}}
