It should be appreciated that one or more antennas can be part of communication platform, which can comprise electronic components and associated circuitry that provide for process- ing and manipulation of received signal(s) and signal(s) to be transmitted, e.g., receivers and transmitters, multiplexer/de- multiplexer (mux/demux) component, and modulation/de- modulation", "type": "Document"}}
