The method of claim 1, wherein the sensed output signal comprises a signal sensed at an output of an output inductor component of said regulator, said output inductor component being arranged in series with an output load impedance of said regulator, and the ripple compensating signal comprises a current compensation signal applied in parallel to said out- put inductor component.\n\nmeans for applying said ripple compensating signal to said passive component to thereby reduce a ripple signal comprising said difference between the level of the ref- erence signal and the sensed output signal,\n\n6. The method of claim 5, wherein the current compensa- tion signal is provided by a linear-type current source.\n\nwherein the compensator circuit is configured such that said compensator circuit does not have to process whole of an output load power of the regulator.\n\n7. The method of claim 1, wherein the regulator comprises linear type voltage or current regulator or a switched type voltage or current regulator.\n\n17. A method of forming a regulator having a power con- version stage and a controller circuit having means for sens- ing an output signal of the regulator and comparing it to a reference signal of the regulator to generate a control signal for controlling the power conversion stage so as to regulate the output signal of the regulator to converge to a level of the reference signal, the method comprising:\n\n8. The method of claim 1, wherein the ripple compensating signal is applied to the output passive component following reference signal feedback loop of the regulator.\n\n9. A regulator comprising:\n\na power conversion stage;\n\nproviding an output compensator circuit having: an input for receiving said reference signal from the regulator; an input for receiving said sensed output signal of the regu- lator;", "type": "Document"}}
