With a current sensing circuitry, a VCSD switch does not have the emulated diode turn-off mechanism. However, it can be lower in cost when compared witha CCSD switch. As long as each current loop has one CCSD switch, such CCSD switch can turn off and cut off the current in the current loop like a power diode. Thus, the current in the VCSD switch in the same current loop will be cut off when the CCSD switch turns off. However, it is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with other embodiments, the switches 102 and/or 104 also can be CCSD switches, instead of VCSD switches. In accordance with an embodiment, one or more of the switches 102, 104, 106, and/or 108 can be MOSFETs (e.g., power MOSFETs). For example, switch 102 and/or 104, which can be VCSD switches, can be n-type", "type": "Document"}}
