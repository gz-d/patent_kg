The flash- light has a generally cylindrical main body portion 11 that houses the battery, and a head portion 4 that houses the light ulb, reflector and protective glass or plastic (not shown) ina conventional manner. The head portion 4 has a circular cross- section perpendicular to an axis A-A that extends through the head portion 4 and also through the main body portion 3 of the ashlight. It will be seen from FIG. 1 that when the flashlight 1 is to be charged, it is preferably placed on the charging surface 10 vertically so that the flashlight 1 is stood on one end with the head portion 4 of the flashlight contacting the charg- ing surface. In this position, the axis of the flashlight is per- endicular surface.", "type": "Document"}}
