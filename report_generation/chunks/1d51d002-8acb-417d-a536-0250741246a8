Processing the reference depth video file may include: processing the reference depth video file to detect edges of the reference depth video file to generate a depth edge video file; and segmenting the depth edge video file into a plurality o temporal depth layers. Optionally, the temporal depth layers are processed to expand the detected edge width in the temporal depth layers. Step 102 may further include: pro- cessing the temporal gradient layers of the reference video file based on the temporal depth layers to obtain weighted temporal gradient layers associated with the reference video file; and processing the temporal gradient layers of the synthesized video file based on the temporal depth layers to obtain weighted temporal gradient layers associated with the synthesized video file. Step 102 may further include: pro- cessing the weighted temporal gradient layers associated with the reference video file and the weighted temporal gradient layers associated with the synthesized video file using sparse representation processing techniques to deter- mine flicker distortion in each of the weighted temporal gradient layers of the synthesized video file. Step 102 may further include: further includes: processing the weighted temporal gradient layers associated with the reference video file and the weighted temporal gradient layers associated with the synthesized video file using sparse representation processing techniques to determine phase distortion and amplitude distortion associated with flicker distortion in each of the weighted temporal gradient layers of the syn- thesized video file. The phase distortion and the amplitude distortion respectively associated with flicker distortion may be weighted in each of the weighted temporal gradient layers", "type": "Document"}}
