The modi- fied protein of the invention, specifically the modified Strep- tococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) protein with a mutation at an N413 position, confers high genome-wide specificity and retains high editing efficiency. The provision of the modified SaCas9 protein of the present invention and a guide RNA (gRNA) establishes a gene-editing system in a cell. The Cas9 protein is guided by the gRNA to cut a target gene at a specific location on a target DNA molecule of a cell. The application of the modified SaCas9 protein of the invention advantageously decreases nuclease activity at one or more off-target positions on a target DNA molecule thereby enabling genome-editing applications with high genome- wide precision. This results in significant reductions of off-target activity and improved specificity of the SaCas9 protein. The modified protein and the related kit comprising\n\nIn an embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 1 or a homologue thereof.\n\nin an embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 2 or homologue thereof.\n\nin an embodiment, the modified protein further comprises one or more mutations at R245, N419 and/or R654 posi- tions.\n\nin an embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 3 or a homologue thereof.\n\nIn an embodiment, protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 4 or a homologue thereof.\n\nin an embodiment, the modified protein with optionally least one additional mutation selected from the group con- sisting of R245, N419 and R654 positions decreases nucle- ase activity at one or more sites on a target DNA molecule.", "type": "Document"}}
