X, X\u2019, Y, Y\u2019, Z platinum atom are together referred to herein as the \u201cplatinum portion\u201d. X, X', Y, Y', and Z are each independently an electron donor ligand; or X, X', Y, and Y' are each independently an electron donor ligand selected from the group consisting of a nitro- gen-containing unidentate, bidentate, or tridentate ligand, an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a phos- phorous-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a sulfur- containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a halogen-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combination thereof; or an oxygen-containing bidentate ligand, a sulfur- containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a nitrogen-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand, a phosphorous-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combination thereof; or an oxygen-containing bidentate ligand, a nitro- gen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combi- nation thereof. Z may be selected from the group of an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a sulfur- containing unidentate or bidentate ligand, a nitrogen-con- taining unidentate or bidentate ligand, a halogen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand and a combination thereof, or an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand; or an oxygen-containing unidentate or bidentate ligand containing at least one functional group. The functional group may be, for example, a carboxyl acid group, an amino-group, a hydroxy group, a thiol group, and a combination thereof. For all the above-mentioned ligands, at least one nitrogen, oxygen, halogen, sulfur, or phosphorous atom should be directly-connected to platinum center via unpaired electron pairs, which can form coordinate covalent bond with plati- num center; thus, these groups can connect with platinum center and become the ligands of platinum complexes. In an embodiment herein, the ligand is a nitrogen-, oxygen-, and/or halogen-containing ligand, as it is believed that most", "type": "Document"}}
