Whole Mounted In Situ Hybridization\n\nto performing screens, specific lar changes in teleost tissues can be detected by in situ hybrid- ization of RNA or antibody staining of specific proteins. A digoxigenin-labeling kit from Roche can be used to label the antisense RNA probes. Antisense probes are synthesized by linearizing plasmids pBlueScript (10 yg) with appropriate restriction enzymes in a 50 ul cocktail. Agarose gel electro- phoresis is to be used as a monitor to make sure the plasmid is totally digested, and an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (Gibco BRL, Life Technology, USA) is used to stop the reaction. The mixture is then centrifuged on a bench top microcentrifuge under room temperature for 3 minutes at full speed (13,000 rpm). The aqueous phase should be transferred to a new tube followed by the addition of Yio volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 8.0) (Sigma, USA) and 2 volumes of ethanol (Sigma, USA), centrifuged for 30 minutes at room temperature. The pellet is then washed with 70% ethanol and left to air dry on bench, resuspended in an appropriate amount of RNase-free (DEPC; Sigma, USA) water to a concentration\n\nh.
