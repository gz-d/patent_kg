The high relative permeability, u,, of the ferrite material guides the magnetic field along and inside the ferrite plates. In the transformer prototype, 4F1 ferrite material is used though any other conventional ferrite material cold also be used. The relative permeability of the 4F1 material is about 80.

Thus, at the boundary,\n\nA PCB transformer using ferrite plates coated with con- ductive sheets formed of copper as a shielding (FIGS. 3(a) and (b)) has been fabricated. The size of the copper sheets is the same as that of the ferrite plate but its thickness is merely 70 wm. Thin copper sheets are required to minimize the eddy current flowing in the z-direction, which may diminish the tangential component of the H-field.\n\nBy -Ba, \u4eba\n\nB,, and B,, are the normal component (in z-direction) of the magnetic flux density in the ferrite plate free space, respectively.\n\nFrom (2),\n\nBased on the integral form of the Maxwell equation,\n\nMyHF p= Hoon\n\n2 \u4e0b 9 4g ia oF (4)\n\nAy, =H4 Hi, (3)\n\nFrom (3), at the boundary between the ferrite plate and free space, the normal component of the magnetic field intensity free space can be much higher than that in the ferrite plate", "type": "Document"}}
