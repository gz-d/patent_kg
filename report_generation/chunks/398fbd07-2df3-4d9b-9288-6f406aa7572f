The dependent variables included the accuracy and the response time of stimuli perception. Here we define the response time as the time duration between the end of the stimulus and the timestamp when the participant makes his/her choice on the touch screen. Since the GUI pops up after the 1.5 s stimuli, the participant could be notified when one stimulus ends as the selection buttons show up. For each combination of the module configuration and the side of ear, the participants were instructed to choose a just noticeable yet comfortable thermal intensity by adjusting the PWM value for each of the Peltier modules before starting the experiment.\n\n[0072] The order of the module configuration and the ear side were counter-balanced using the Latin Square method, splitting into 2 ears 3 configurations=6 sessions, for each participant. The locations and the directions (hot/cold) of the stimuli were randomly presented within each combination of the module configuration and the side of ear. Each stimulus is repeated thrice, resulting in 2 ears (left and right)x(3+4+5) module positionsx2 directions of temperature changex3 repetitions=144 trials for each participant.\n\n[0073] Procedure and Task", "type": "Document"}}
