CRYSTALS-Dil- ithium is a digital signature scheme that has been proved secure under chosen message attacks. It has been selected to the third-round finalists of the NIST PQC standardization process and has a good chance to be included in the final standard. The most time-consuming operations in the Dil-\n\nUS 2024/0143524 Al\n\nithium scheme are the extendable-output function (XOF) and the matrix/vector multiplication in the polynomial ring. The parameters of polynomial ring and XOF are the same in different security levels, but only involving fewer or more operations. The officially submitted Dilithium implementa- tion is described in the C language, and there is an AVX2 optimized version.\n\nThe\n\nof different software and hardware\n\n[0044] deployment platforms significantly impacts the performance of the cryp- tosystems. There are many software and hardware design explorations for the evaluation of the NIST PQC algorithm standardization process. Software implementation owns the merits of easy portability and short development time thus normally become the first performance evaluation choice. Dilithium may be implemented on ARM Cortex-M3 and. ARM Cortex-M4 to explore the trade-off between speed and memory usage strategy. Alternatively, cached based kernel- level accelerators or SIKE on 32-bit ARMv7-A processors with optimized finite field arithmetic may be implemented in other examples.\n\n[0045] Although a relatively longer development cycle may be required, hardware implementation (e.g. FPGA and ASIC) can easily outperform software implementation in terms of speed and power, thus also plays an important role during the standardization process.", "type": "Document"}}
