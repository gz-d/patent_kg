The wells and the microplate are invisible in FIG. 3 for clearer illustration. For such a surface area, the preferred drop size of the hydrophobic solution is 150 yl. This ratio of the surface area to volume of the solution is therefore about 191.1 mm? or less (1.911 cm?): 150 ul. That is, or 200 mm? or less: 150 pl. This ratio of surface area to the volume of the solution dropped onto the surface has been found to provide very small and uniformly sized nanoparticles of the drug. All the 24-wells in the microplate 101 can each be infused with the solution of this volume.\n\n[0044] The depth of the ice 301 is less important regarding the infusion of the solution, but may be relevant relating to the flash freezing of the ice 301 to provide the ice template, as the speed of flash freezing is related to the volume of the water in the well 103.\n\n[0045] FIG. 4 further shows how the solution is able to infuse the pores in the ice 301. A suitable volume of the solution 303 the drug is dropped onto the surface of the ice 301. The solution can seep into the pores in the ice 301 slowly and eventually occupy the pores 401.\n\n[0046] Given time, the solution 303 is able to infuse into the ice 301 fully. Preferably, however, further drops of pure solvent without the solute are applied to the surface of the ice 301, over the earlier applied hydrophobic solution con- taining the dissolved drug, to push traces of the solution further into the pores to increase the likelihood that all of the drug precipitates inside the pores.", "type": "Document"}}
