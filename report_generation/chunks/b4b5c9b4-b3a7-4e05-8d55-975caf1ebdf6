The system of claim 7, wherein the microneedle-based drug delivery module has at least two electrodes exposed out of the microneedles to connect to the other metal coil of the antenna which is more proximal to the bottom layer of the wirelessly-controlled electrostimulation module.\n\n10. The system of claim 9, wherein the connections between the other metal coil and the two electrodes of the microneedle-based drug delivery module are magnesium foil lines extended from the other metal coil.\n\n11. The system of claim 10, wherein the magnesium foil lines extended from the other metal coil are hot pressed on the two electrodes of the microneedles.\n\n12. The\n\nof claim\n\nwherein the\n\nsystem 10, magnesium lines are coated with tungsten to delay biodegradation thereof in vivo.\n\nfoil\n\n13. The system of claim 1, wherein the microneedle-based drug delivery module has a substrate supporting the micro- protrusions and is made of a bioresorbable and biodegrad- able material having a sufficient stiffness to withstand force applied thereto during insertion to tissues of the site while the microprotrusions are able to penetrate through a surface of the target site with a sufficient depth to effectively deliver the intended substance to the target site.\n\n14. The system of claim 1, wherein the substrate and microprotrusions of the microneedle-based drug delivery module are made of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) with molecular weight of about 60,000 Da and a molar ratio lactide:glycolide at 65:35.\n\na\n\nof\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\n15. The system of claim 1, wherein the substrate of the microneedle-based drug delivery module has a uniform thickness of about 120 jum, or a thickness which allows certain bendability and secures the microneedle-based drug delivery module to tissues of the site of delivery with various curvatures.", "type": "Document"}}
