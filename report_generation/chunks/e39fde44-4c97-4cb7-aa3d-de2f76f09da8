After 8 to 24 h of infection , cells were fixed\n\naforementioned\n\nays to measure ZIKV , JEV and DENV\n\nwith 4 % PFA and subject to DsRNA immunostaining and\n\ninfection . The inventors particularly examined the localiza\n\nDAPI staining . The images were finally captured by Cel\n\ntion of the virus replication in host cells by co - immunos\n\nlInsight CX7 High - Content Screening platform with a 20x\n\ntaining the host cells after JEV infection with DsRNA\n\nobjective lens , and analyzed in HCS StudioTM 3.0 ( Thermo\n\nantibody and antibodies against different organelle markers .\n\nFisher , Waltham , Mass . , USA ) to quantify the percentage of\n\nAs shown in FIG . 10 , DsRNA signal exhibited weak co\n\ninfected cells versus uninfected cells .\n\nlocalization with early endosome ( anti - EEIA staining ) ,\n\n[ 0080 )\n\nInhibitory effect of berbamine and its analogues\n\nGolgi , endoplasmic reticulum ( anti - Calnexin staining ) , or\n\nagainst ZIKV or JEV infection The inventors determined the\n\nlysosome ( anti - LAMP1 staining ) .
