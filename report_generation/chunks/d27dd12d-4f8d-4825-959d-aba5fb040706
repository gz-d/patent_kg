Although the pristine NCM811 shows a comparable capac- ity to the inventive engineered NCM811 at 0.1 C, their capacity gap grows as the current density increases. In particular, the PGE-NCM811 material delivers a high capac- ity of 152.4 mAh g 1 at 5 C, whereas the pristine one drops severely to 122.7 mAh g 1. The improved rate capability of PGE-NCM811 cathode may be attributed to the facile Li* diffusion and electron transfer, as revealed by the potentio- static intermittent titration (PITT, FIG. 10) and electro- conductivity tests (Table 3), which may be derived from its higher conductivity of the monoclinic grain boundaries.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nElectronic conductivity \u00ab Target materials (Sem!)
