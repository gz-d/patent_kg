In one embodiment, the monomeric unit consists of a dimer diamine end-capped with ureidopyrimidinone (UPy). The inventors unexpectedly found that the composition of the present invention can be constructed through polymerization and intermolecular crosslinks, wherein a hierarchical hydrogen-bond cross- linked network can facilitate the composition with high mechanical strength and fast healing properties.\n\n[0138] 1 equivalent of (UPy-NCO),Priamine powder was stirred and dissolved in 2 equivalent carvacrol at 80\u00b0 C. and evaporated at room temperature for 12 hours to promote full network formation. Preparation of compositions with dif- ferent weight ratios of monomeric units and hydrophobic material were prepared according to the method described above and are summarised in Table 1 below. UP denotes monomeric unit (UPy-NCO),Priamine, C denotes hydro- phobic material, particularly essential oil.\n\n[0131] Ureidopyrimidinone motifs were found to form strong quadruple hydrogen bonds that promote linear chain extension and advantageously enable monomeric properties. Weak hydrogen bond interactions between urea units were found to provide intermolecular crosslinks between the monomeric backbones. The introduction of a hydrophobic material, for example carvacrol, into the one or more mono- meric unit network disrupted the weak hydrogen bond crosslinks and facilitated the formation of a gel-like com- position. The inventors beneficially found that the content of hydrophobic material, particularly carvacrol in this example, could be controlled to regulate the mechanical strength of the composition.\n\nTABLE 1", "type": "Document"}}
