In one exemplary em- bodiment, one or both of the first and second support members 10a and 10b can be longitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. The support members 10a and 10b can be secured onto the spine 2 through various securing elements, such as hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the upper ends 16a and 16b of the support members 10a and 10b can be fixed to each other and an upper vertebra 6 through wires, hooks, screws, clamps, and the like. In another exemplary embodiment, the first and second support members 10a and 10b can be secured to differ- ent upper and/or lower vertebrae 6 and 8. [0050] In one exemplary embodiment, the second sup- port member 10b can be formed of a superelastic material or other materials of comparable properties. The supere- lastic support member 10b can be deposited on the de- formed spine portion 4, such as shown in Fig. 4. In an exemplary embodiment, the second support member 10b can be bent to form a curved portion 14b conforming to the deformed spine portion 4 and join the same through various anchor members 30. For example, the anchor members 30 can be implanted to one or more vertebra to fix the second support member 10b to the deformed spine portion 4. The anchor members 30 can be operated in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, the anchor members 30 can be left unlocked at the time of the spine surgery and activated to switch to a locked po- sition after the surgery. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more [0051] transverse traction members 32 can be provided to gen- erate an independent constant or substantially constant correction force. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 4, the transverse traction members 32 can be provided to join between the first and second support members 10a and 10b. In one exemplary embodiment, the transverse traction", "type": "Document"}}
