FIG. 4a shows Gaussian- Lorentzian fitting profiles of the XPS spectra for the pristine and PGE-NCMB811 materials. The inset depicts the penetra- tion depth of 5 nm for the XPS method. FIG. 45 is a comparison of the Ni L-edge soft XAS spectra and Ni K-edge hard XAS spectra for both pristine and PGE- NCM811. The dashed lines direct the oxidizing states of the Ni ions in soft XAS. The arrow shows the increasing trend of the Ni** state in the PGE-NCM811 surface. The insets depict the penetration depth of about 20 nm for the soft XAS and sub-micron level for hard XAS. FIG. 4c are HAADF images of the PGE-NCM811 material. The arrow indicates the pathway and direction of the EELS scan. The inset is the corresponding low-magnification HAADF image and the square emphasizes the amplifying area for the EELS mea- surement. FIG. 4d shows EELS spectra of Ni L-edge scan- ning along the pathway in FIG. 4c. The squares depict the L; and L, peaks, respectively. The dashed line shows the EELS character of Ni**. The arrow directs the scanning pathway in\n\nFIG. 4c.\n\n[0012] FIGS. 5a-c are characterizations of electronic structures for pristine and PGE-NCM811 materials.
