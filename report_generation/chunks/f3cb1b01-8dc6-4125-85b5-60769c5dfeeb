The first excitation member may include a conductor strip arranged on an outer surface of the dielectric block. The conductor strip may be generally rectangular or generally trapezoidal, tapered, etc.\n\n[0005] U.S. Pat. No. 9,966,662B proposes a solution that improves on these existing systems/methods. It teaches a compact dual-frequency antenna based on a single radiator with two back-to-back folded plates. In this structure, the folded plates form a microwave parallel-plate waveguide resonator antenna and the separation between the folded plates gives a millimeter-wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. The waveguide resonator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna provide bandwidths of 9.7% and 2.1% and cover the 2.4 and 24 GHz ISM bands, respectively. Prob- lematically, however, much wider bandwidths would be required to simultaneously support two or more of 4G, 5G, and future standard communications. Also, the antenna disclosed is rather heavy as it uses relatively thick metals to keep the conductive plates parallel.", "type": "Document"}}
