The methodology 3400 can be uti- lized in single-phase and multi-phase systems. At 3402, a rectified power signal can be generated from an input power signal received by a subset of power switches, wherein power switches in the subset are arranged in relation to each other to emulate functionality of a diode rectifier. At 3404, at least a portion of the rectified power signal can be supplied to an SDGD subsystem associated with the subset of power switches to facilitate controlling respective switching of respective power switches of the subset of power switches in order to facilitate rectifying the input power signal.\n\nAt3606, a low-side portion ofthe SDGD subsystem, which can be associated with at least two other power switches of the plurality of power switches, can be formed.
