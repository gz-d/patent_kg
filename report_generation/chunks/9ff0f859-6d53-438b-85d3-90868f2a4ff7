These fundamental properties of the EM wave can be function of space 7 and time t. For example, the electric field of a plane-wave can be expressed as E(r , t}-\u20ac\u00e9A cos(2nft+le : 7\n\n+).\n\n[0005] Electromagnetic (EM) wave related technologies are closely related to the control and utilization of these fundamental properties of EM waves. Conventional EM wave manipulation techniques primarily rely on the accu- mulated propagation effect in naturally-existing dielectric materials, such as lenses, optical modulators, and wave- plates. These optical components are often bulky and have curved shapes, which make them unsuitable for modern integrated electronic and photonic systems.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
