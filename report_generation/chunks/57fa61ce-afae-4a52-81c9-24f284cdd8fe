Although alloying can improve the corrosion resis- tance of magnesium alloy, this technique may introduce biological toxicity due to the use of rare earth metals, such as cerium and yttrium. Additionally, the compatibility with living cells remains a problem. The mechanical properties of magnesium alloy are closer to human natural bone than those of other metallic materials such as titanium alloys and stainless steel. However, there is still a discrepancy between magnesium alloy and natural bone in terms of bulk mechani- cal\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nsubject application a application application Ser.

One important issue with implants is that due to biomechanical and physiologic requirements, an implant material should have a certain mechanical strength or elas- ticity to be incorporated into the target tissue and anatomic region. Also, degradability or possibly even incorporating pharmacologically or therapeutically active agents is also desirable.\n\nReaction (2):\n\nReaction (3):\n\nMg+2H2O \u4e00 Mg(OH)b+H2", "type": "Document"}}
