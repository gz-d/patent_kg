The in-plane arrangement of the thermoelectric modules (i.e. the semiconductor elements) helps to increase the exposure area of the thermoelectric modules i.e. the area of the thermoelectric modules that are exposed to body heat. An increased area of exposure results in a larger current or voltage being produced by the ther- moelectric device 100, 200.\n\n[0156] The device 200 comprises three rows of thermo- electric modules 210A, 210B, 210C. The thermoelectric modules 210 within each row are connected in a series electrical connection i.e. a series arrangement. Each row may be in electrical communication with the adjacent rows. In one example form, the rows 210A, 210B, 210C may be interconnected to each other in a series electrical connection. In another example form, the rows 210A-210C may be connected in a parallel electrical connection. The thermo- electric device 200 comprises at least a pair of electrodes (ie. a first electrode 204 and second electrode 206) that are in electrical communication with the rows of thermoelectric modules 210A-210C.The device 200 may also comprise multiple bridging conductors (i.e. conductor members) 220 that electrically couple the rows 210A-210C with each other to form either a series or parallel arrangement. In the illustrated example the bridging conductors 220 connect the rows of thermoelectric modules in a series electrical arrangement.", "type": "Document"}}
