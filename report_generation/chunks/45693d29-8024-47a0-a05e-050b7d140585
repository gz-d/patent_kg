Modifying the morphology of the precursor may include oxidizing a plurality of interfacial atoms of the precursor so as to enrich the primary-grain interfaces, such that the nickel ions on the surface of primary precursors are oxidized from 2+ to 3+ state.\n\n[0027] Oxidizing the interfacial atoms of the precursor includes mixing an aqueous solution containing a salt of the precursor with an oxidizing agent and extracting the pre- cursor from the aqueous solution after oxidation. In particu- Jar, the precursor may be extracted using a precipitation and filtration method. The precursors may include nickel and additional transition metal salts such as sulfates, chlorides, or nitrates or other soluble salts.\n\n[0028] The oxidizing agent may be selected from known oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate, potas- sium dichromate, hydrogen peroxide, perchloric acid and ferric chloride. The amount of the oxidizing agent may be in the range of approximately 1 to approximately 20 mol %.\n\n[0029] The precursor solution with the oxidizing agent is brought to a pH value sufficient to induce precipitation of the precursors. In general, a pH in a range of 9.5 to 11.5 may be used. For example, a pH of greater than 11 for sulfate precursors, more particularly, a pH of 11.2 may be used to precipitate the precursors.
