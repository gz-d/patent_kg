In some examples, the transmission line arrangement may comprise, or consist only of, a transmission line. In some examples, the transmission line may be straight. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement may comprise, or consist only of, a capacitor. In some examples, the transmission line has a length, and the capacitor is electrically connected at or near a middle of the length of the transmission line.\n\n[0010] In some embodiments, the first oscillator and second oscillator are arranged to differentially feed the antenna arrangement.\n\nthe patch\n\n[0011] In some embodiments, the patch antenna arrange- ment comprises: a first patch element operably coupled with the first oscillator and the second oscillator, and a second patch element operably coupled with the first oscillator and the second oscillator. In some examples, the first patch element and the second patch element may be generally identical in terms of shape and size and material.", "type": "Document"}}
