The field emission element may be a cold-cathode element or a Schottky element. One exemplary cold cathode element is made of single crystal tungsten sharpened to a tip. One exemplary Schottky element is made by coating a tungsten tip with a layer of zirconium oxide.\n\nIn accordance with a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising the electron gun of the first aspect. The apparatus may be an electron microscope, such as a scanning electron microscope, a semiconductor inspection apparatus, a particle accelerator, etc.\n\nIn accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for operating the electron gun of the first aspect. The method includes controlling the control circuit to adjust an electric field provided by the control element.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the control circuit arranged to provide a variable resistance for changing the electric field provided by the control element.\n\nIn accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention, provided a method for operating the apparatus of second aspect. The method includes controlling the control circuit to adjust an electric field provided by the control element.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the control circuit comprises a first resistor and a second resistor electrically connected in series, and a switch connected across the second resistor. The switch is controlled to selectively open and close to change an equivalent resistance provided by the first resistor and the second resistor. The switch(es) may each include a photo-relay.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nEmbodiments of the invention will now be described, of example, with reference to the accompanying draw- in which:", "type": "Document"}}
