The system 300 is used to create an optical fiber 100' with a tip, e.g., like the one in FIG. 1. The tip created may be in nano-scale. In one example, the tip may have a tip radius of smaller than 100 nm. The system 300 includes a pair of clamps 302 for clamping an optical fiber (to be processed to produce a tip). The clamps 302 are mounted on respective movable platforms 304 that can be selectively moved towards and away from each other to adjust a tensioning of the clamped optical fiber 100\u2019. The platforms 302 are each connected with a respective driving source (e.g., motor) 306 to affect its movement. The system includes an energy source, e.g., laser source 308 (with a CO, laser cavity) arranged to provide laser energy for melting a\n\nfor the\n\nTHE\n\ntopography\n\naccurately\n\nshows\n\ntransmission electron\n\na\n\nsource with high spatial and temporal resolution.
