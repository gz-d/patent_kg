After demodulation at the trans- mitter side, the data is then forwarded to the transmitter con- troller (MCUp) and a central processing unit (CPU). The operation flowchart of the system is given in FIG. 11 and the details of each mode is explained as follows: 20\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n1. A planar battery charging system, comprising:\n\na primary power transmission side formed of an array of primary windings adapted to generate magnetic flux substantially perpendicular to a charging surface; and\n\na secondary power receiving side comprising a secondary winding associated with a battery to be charged and being adapted to receive said magnetic flux when placed on said charging surface, said secondary winding being provided with electromagnetic shielding on the side of said winding opposite from the side to be placed on the charging surface;", "type": "Document"}}
