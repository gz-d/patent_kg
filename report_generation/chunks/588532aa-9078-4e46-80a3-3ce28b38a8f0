In one example, the pulsed energy source includes a pulsed laser source arranged to provide laser pulses to excite the metallic arrangement to emit pulses of electrons or pulses of electron beams. Preferably, the laser pulses are femtosecond laser pulses. As such the electron source may be a pulsed elec- tronic source that can provide femtosecond time resolution.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0011] In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided an electron microscope including the device of the first aspect. The electron microscope may be transmission electron microscope (e.g., femtosecond trans- mission electron microscope).\n\n[0003] In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a device for providing electrons, compris- ing: an optical fiber with a tip and a metallic arrangement arranged at the tip. The metallic arrangement is arranged to be excited by an energy source to emit electrons or electron beams. The tip is preferably sized in micro-scale, more preferably in nano-scale. The tip may include a sharp end or a rounded end. The rounded end may have a radius of less than 100 nm.\n\n[0012] In accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided an electron microscope including the electron source of the second aspect. The electron source may be a field emission source. The electron microscope may be a transmission electron microscope (e.g., femtosec- ond transmission electron microscope).\n\n[0004] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the metallic arrangement comprises a metallic surface at the tip. The metallic arrangement may be made from chromium (Cr), gold (Au), or tungsten (W).", "type": "Document"}}
