[0010] Other methods in which a gradual but constant force is applied to the scoliotic spine include external halo traction, intermittent open lengthening and shape change from shape memory alloys. For example, the shape memory effect (SME) of nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy has been used to correct scoliosis in a goat model. However, the mechanical strength of SME was insufficient to fully correct spinal deformities. Pseudoelasticity, another property of nickel-titanium shape memory alloy, can be useful to overcome the above problem and provide a constant recovery force for deformations within the range of 8%. However, such constant correction forces must be kept low to avoid fracture at the anchoring points or interface of the bone and the implant and avoid neuro- logical deficit. [0011] Furthermore, because scoliosis correction is carried out instantaneously and only at the time of surgery with no time for the tissues to relax, the load on the spine rises rapidly. The increased load on the corrected spine limits the amount of correction force that is safely possi- ble. [0012] On the other hand, US-A-4 078 559 discloses a device for correcting spinal deformities, comprising a support member adapted to be mounted onto a portion of a spine and an anchor member adapted to join a portion of the support member to a deformed spine portion, wherein the support member is capable of providing a constant correction force to the deformed spine portion, which force is maintained until the deformities are cor- rected. [0013] Known devices having similar features - which are mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 which follows - are also disclosed by EP-A-0 470 660 and US-A-5 672 175. [0014] The present invention provides a device that overcomes the above problems. Additionally or alterna- tively, the present invention is capable of continuously providing a constant force to the spine even after surgery without", "type": "Document"}}
