An exemplary core-shell nanoparticle formed according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 3C. A thin shell of approximately 2 nm includes amorphous carbon and surround a metal core of approximately 25-60 nm. In the method described below freestanding nanosheets can be easily transferred to various planar or non-planar substrates, which facilitate the fabrication of complex- shaped electrode and biosensor materials by decomposing the polymer portions of nanosheets for surface modification, forming core-shell structures.\n\nthe\n\nnanosheet\n\nmetal\n\ninventive method,\n\n[0059]\n\nIn\n\na\n\nformed on polymer-covered glass substrate. The metal nanosheet is delaminated from the polymer-covered glass substrate through immersion in a fluid. The delaminated nanosheet 1s transferred onto a second target substrate that includes a polymer precursor for the shell layer. The organic- metal nanosheet are heated to decompose the organic mate- rial to form an amorphous carbon-containing shell that surrounds the metal nanocore. The amorphous-carbon-con- taining shell is approximately 2 nm thick or less on a core having an average size of approximately 42 nm Turning to FIG. 1A, a method is depicted in detail for synthesizing a metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure. In FIG. 1, the method is for the production of crystalline gold nan- oparticles encapsulated by amorphous carbon; however, other encapsulated metal nanoparticles may be formed using\n\nthe same technique.\n\n[0060] Step I\u2014PVA solution was spin coated on a glass substrate until it can fully and uniformly cover the surface of the glass substrate to form a PVA-covered glass substrate;\n\n[0061] Step I]\u2014the prepared PVA-covered glass substrate dehydrated in a drying oven at 80\u00b0 C. for 1 hour and air-cooled to room temperature;\n\nwas", "type": "Document"}}
