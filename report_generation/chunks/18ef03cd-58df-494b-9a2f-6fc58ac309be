The lines of flux 204 of this charging platform flow \"perpendicularly\" in and out of the charging surface 200 (Fig.2). This perpendicular flow of flux is very beneficial because it allows the energy transfer over the surface on which the electronic equip- ment (to be charged) is placed. [0005] For both planar charging platform described above, it is necessary to use an electromagnetic shield on the bottom surface. If the charging platform is placed on a metallic desk, the AC flux generated in the charging platform may induce currents in the metallic desk, result- ing in incorrect energy transfer and even heating effects in the metallic desk. US 6,501,364 describes an effective electromagnetic shield for this type of planar charging platform. The electromagnetic shield of US 6,501,364 simply consists of a thin layer of soft magnetic material (such as ferrite) and a thin layer of conductive material (such as copper). [0006] Regarding energy transfer from the planar sur- face, one coreless printed-circuit-board (PCB) transform- er technology pioneered by Hui and Tang has been prov- en to be an effective technique (see for example: EP935263A: Hui, S.Y.R.; Tang, S.C.; Chung, H., \u2019Core- less printed-circuit board transformers for signal and en- ergy transfer\u2019, Electronics Letters, Volume: 34 Issue: 11, 28 May 1998, Page(s): 1052-1054; Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung; Tang, S.C., \u2019Coreless printed circuit board (PCB) transformers for power MOSFET/IGBT gate drive circuits\u2019, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Volume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 422-430;Tang, S.C.; Hui, S.Y.R.; Henry Shu-Hung Chung, \u2019Coreless printed circuit board (PCB) transformers with multiple secondary windings for complementary gate drive cir- cuits\u2019, IEEE Transaction on Power Electronics, Volume: 14 Issue: 3, May 1999, Page(s): 431-437; Hui, S.Y.R.;", "type": "Document"}}
