Cl.\n\nHO25 7/00 (2006.01)\n\nA battery pack for an electronic device comprises battery cells, a battery charging circuit, and an energy receiving ele- ment adapted to receive power from a planar inductive charg- ing system. The energy receiving element has an inductance and a capacitor is connected to the energy receiving element and forms a resonant tank therewith. A diode rectifier and a DC capacitor are connected to the energy receiving element to provide a rectified DC voltage that can be fed from the energy receiving element to said battery charging circuit. The energy receiving element may comprise a soft magnetic sheet with a coil wound around its edges, or a coil formed on a printed circuit board, or a combination of the two. The energy receiving element may be formed integrally with the battery pack, or may be provided as a separate component that can be added\n\n(52) US.
