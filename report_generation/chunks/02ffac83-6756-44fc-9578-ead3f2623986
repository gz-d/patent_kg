It has been explained in WO03/105308 that the primary circuit (i.e. equivalent circuit of the inductive battery charging platform) is essentially a L-C resonant circuit. By choos- ing the resonant frequencies of both primary and sec- ondary resonant circuits to be identical or as close as possible, energy transfer between them can be opti- mized. With the use of a core-based planar inductor in this proposal, the inductance value of Lr can be much greater than that of a coreless spiral winding as in the prior art. Therefore, according to the above equation, the resonant frequencies of both of the primary and second- ary circuit can be selected at a relatively low frequency range (e.g. 100kHz to 45kHz) instead of 950 kHz as in the case of the prior art. [0029] When placed on the charging platform, the charged electronic equipment has the active side of the battery pack near and parallel to the charging surface of the charging platform, which produces a magnetic flux\n\n5\n\n9\n\nEP 1 908 159 B1\n\n10", "type": "Document"}}
