In Step 600 a source block S of video or image data is defined or received by computing or image processing apparatus. In step 610 a pre- dicted block P is predicted from the source block using inter or intra predicting according to a particular encoding mode (for example, one of the encoding modes allowed by the H.264/AVC standard). In step 620 a residual block is com- puted by subtracting the predicted block P from the source block S. In step 630 an integer image transform (e.g. an ICT) is performed on the residual block D to obtain a transformed. residual block F* having a plurality of co-efficient f,,*. In step 640 a look up table is referred to iteratively to carry out pre-scaled quantizing of the block F* to obtain the coefficient z,, of the quantized transformed residual block. In step 650 the quantized transformed residual block is entropy encoded and in step 660 the number of bits required to entropy encode the block are noted. In step 670 the inverse quantized coefficients are found by referring to the look up table. Preferably the inverse quantized coefficients will be stored in the look up table, however if they are not, then they could be found by multiplying the coefficient zy by a corresponding pre-scaled\n\nAlternatively the area may just contain one block (e.g. one macroblock) in all the encoding modes. In that case the rate- distortion of the area according to a particular encoding mode simply the rate-distortion of that block.\n\nFIG. 12 shows a system for computing the sum of squared differences between a source and reconstructed block image or video data that is encoded by inter or intra predic- tion. It comprises a plurality of modules which may be soft- ware or hardware components.", "type": "Document"}}
