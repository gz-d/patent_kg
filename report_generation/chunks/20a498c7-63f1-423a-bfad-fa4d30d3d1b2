With the change of SPR wave- length due to refractive index alternation and a fixed birefrin- gent retardation introduced between the two polarized beams, the phase term \u7531 srR can be extracted with appropriate signal processing method to determine the change of refractive index.\n\nWhen the carrier frequency modulation technique is imple- mented, the intensity signal will reflect the phase stepping introduced by the retarder 221. For example, the retardation of the liquid crystal variable retarder 221 is alternated by the electronic controller 223. That is, the carrier frequency modu- lation 220 can introduce a time delay between the p-polarized and s-polarized components up to a for all the wavelengths interrogated before the polarized beams recombine at the exit of the interferometric path to the detection unit 500, so that each pixel of the detector array of the prober 512 can detect its own temporal oscillation. That is, the optical detector pixel array can be a high density linear charge-coupled optoelec- tronic detector array for capturing the spectral oscillation change induced by the SPR sensing unit; and the digitized carrier-frequency-modulated interferograms can be stored so\n\nan\n\nis\n\n10\n\n20\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nSimulation results for the phase responses of the optical\n\ning layer at each wavelength interval, which is the phase signal detected in each spectral element within the spectral\n\nUS 8,953,168 B2\n\n8\n\n7\n\nferential spectral interferometry.
