In the actual hardware implementation, the relative positions between the receiving electrode layer 114, the transmitting electrode layer 116, and the ground electrode layer 118 usually do not change. Thus, given the equations (1) and (2), it can be inferred the following equation (3).\n\nGB)\n\nWhere d,,;\u201c represents a distance between the Kk receiving electrode portion RP of the receiving electrode layer 114 and wearer\u2019s finger, and A,,,\u201c represents an overlapping area between the K receiving electrode portion RP of the receiv- ing electrode layer 114 and wearer\u2019s finger. The equation (3) indicates the output electrical signal V,* from the KE receiv- ing electrode portion RP of the receiving electrode layer 114 changes proportionally to the distance between the finger and the k\u2019 receiving electrode portion RP of the receiving electrode layer 114, and changes inversely proportional to the overlapping area between them. In short, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the change of the output electrical signal V.* reflects the movement pattern of the thumb finger which may indicate the type of the T2I gestures.\n\nOptimizing device wearing angle", "type": "Document"}}
