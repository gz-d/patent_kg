Thermal feedback is usually silent and effec- tive in noisy environments. The characteristics of single- spot and multi-spots thermal feedback have been investigated for mobile devices and smart wearable acces- sories (e.g., ear hook, headband, bracelet, and finger ring), with a reliable recognition accuracy for general purposes. In addition, the thermal feedback may be integrated on the steering wheel for notifying lane changes and directions in driving simulation. The spatial thermal feedback has also been used ln the assistive device to provide navigation cues for visually-impaired people, showing the advantages of localization over the vibrotactile feedback.\n\n[0005] The ear, as one of the body parts that are more sensitive to tactile feedback, has motivated the emerging research of wearable haptic devices. With the recent advancements in the Bearable technologies that focuses on the auditory output, many HCI researchers and analysts proposed \u2018ear as the new wrist\u2019, and started the research of wearable devices which could be worn on and around the ear and head. Research shows that the multi-point spatial vibrot- actile feedback could be reliably perceived on the ear with the average accuracy over 80%. On the other hand, the on/around-ear (l.e., auricular) spatial thermal haptics for wearables is less explored when compared to the vibrotactile feedback. While thermal feedback has shown great potential in facilitating information representation, it is still unclear how it could be perceived as a wearable form factor as ear is one of the body parts that are very sensitive to temperature\n\nchange.\n\nits\n\nApr. 20, 2023", "type": "Document"}}
