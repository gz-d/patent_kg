A Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is often used for this purpose, but other types of transform may be used instead. The human eye is less sensitive to information contained in the high frequency components and therefore some information relating to the higher frequencies may be discarded or encoded using fewer bits, in order to reduce the amount of data. Once this is done the transformed block may be quantized, by scaling the transform coefficients to the nearest of a number of predetermined values. For example, if the transform coefficients are between -1 and 1, then scaling\n\nA skip mode is a special case of an inter encoding mode. relates a source block directly to a reference block in another frame (i.e. the two are predicted to be identical).
