In the example of FIG. 1, a secondary winding 5 is formed integrally with the head portion 4 of the flashlight 1. In particular, the secondary winding 5 comprises at least one coil (and preferably multiple coils) of a conduc- tive material extending around the circumference of the head ortion 4 of the flashlight. In this way, the secondary winding 5 can be formed ina very simple manner and yet be integrated with the structure of the flashlight 1. When the flashlight 1 is stood on the charging surface 10 with the head portion 4 oriented down so that it contacts the charging surface, then the secondary winding 5 will be parallel to the charging surface and close to the charging surface so that the maximum amount of magnetic flux will pass through the secondary winding 5. This will optimize the charging of the recharge- able battery. Suitable circuitry (not shown), including, for example, a DC voltage regulator, may be provided connecting", "type": "Document"}}
