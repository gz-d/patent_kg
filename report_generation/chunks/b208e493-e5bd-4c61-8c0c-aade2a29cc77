A system for determining flow speed based on pho- toacoustic imaging or sensing, comprising:\n\none or more processors arranged to:\n\nreceive a first photoacoustic signal and a second pho- toacoustic signal from a sample in response to trans- mission of a first laser pulse and a second laser pulse to the sample, the first pulse laser has a first wave- length and the second laser pulse has a second wavelength different from the first wavelength; and\n\nprocess the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a flow model that relates photoacoustic signals with flow speed determine a flow speed of a liquid flow in the sample.\n\n22. The system of claim 21, wherein the one or more processors are arranged to determine a first amplitude of the first photoacoustic signal and a second amplitude of the second photoacoustic signal; and apply the first and second amplitudes to the flow model.\n\n23. The system of claim 22, wherein the flow model relates the first and second amplitude with flow speed by:\n\n_ Fetter Pie Fabtar PAW Catton \u5403 = oO Fike | Fitter\n\nwhere P, is the first amplitude, P, is the second amplitude, Fi and F, are optical fluences associated with the first and. second laser pulses, Hai and hs are the optical absorption coeflicients associated with the first and second laser pulses, A, T,, and b are coefficients independent of the flow, St is a time delay between the first and second laser pulses, v is the flow speed.\n\n24. The system of claim 21, further comprising a photoa- coustic imaging or sensing apparatus having a probe arranged to transmit the first laser pulse and the second laser pulse to the sample.\n\na\n\n25. The system of claim 21, wherein the one or more processors are arranged to process one of the first photoa- coustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on photoacoustic absorption model to determine particulate concentration in liquid.", "type": "Document"}}
