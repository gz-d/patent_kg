For instance, the switches 102, 104, 106, and 108 can respectively comprise body diodes 120, 122, 124, and 126, wherein the arrangement of the switches 102, 104, 106, and 108, and thus, the body diodes 120, 122, 124, and 126 in the circuit can be such that the body diodes 120, 122, 124, and 126 can be structured and can function as a bridge-rectifier, including during initial start-up of the SDSR. (e.g., prior to the rectified DC voltage providing at least a portion of the desired to the switches of the SDSR).", "type": "Document"}}
