Since the lines of flux enter and leave the planar charging surface vertically, a very thin secondary coil can be used to pick up the magnetic flux. This results in the possibility of a slim design for the secondary module that can be embedded in the portable elec- tronic load.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided, in a first aspect, a planar battery charging system comprising a primary power transmission side formed of an array of primary windings adapted to generate magnetic flux substantially perpendicular to a charging surface, and a secondary power receiving side comprising a secondary winding associated with a battery to be charged and being adapted to receive the magnetic flux when a sec- ondary winding is placed on the charging surface. A primary winding is energized by a control circuit com- prising a first-stage power converter and a second stage power inverter, both being on the primary power trans- mission side, the first stage power converter being con- trolled to provide a controlled variable DC link voltage on the primary power transmission side, and the second stage power inverter generating a controlled fixed fre- AC the\n\n40\n\nRecent research in the field of planar magnetics and planar transformer technology has prompted the development of planar contactless battery charging systems for portable elec- tronic equipment. Among them, two proposals are particu- larly of interest, because they allow one or more items of electronic equipment to be placed and charged simulta- neously on the charging surface, regardless of the orientation of the electronic equipment. 45", "type": "Document"}}
