The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the modified titanium alloy is configured for implan- tation in orthopaedic, cardiovascular, or dental op- erations.\n\n5. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the plasma treatment process involves plasma im- mersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII&D), and the parameters of the PIII&D include a plasma source of at least one of water, oxygen, ammonia, fluorine, nitrogen, gold, silver, copper, silicon-car- bine, iridium oxide, carbon, and diamond like carbon, an implantation voltage in a range of 1kV - 100kV, a frequency in a range of 1 Hz - 1,000Hz, and duration of time in a range of 1 min - 100 hours.\n\n6. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the modified titanium alloy has a surface topography of a ripple-like pattern.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n12. The surgical implant according to claim 10, further comprising an intermediate layer formed by reactive functional groups, preferably comprising an -OH group, wherein the -OH group is fabricated by pres- surized hydrogen peroxide treatment and a series of heating processes or an amide group (-NH2), wherein the amide group is fabricated by nitrogen, oxygen and ammonia plasma immersion ion implan- tation, on the plasma treated titanium alloy surface, wherein the intermediate layer facilitates linker mol- ecule coupling on the plasma treated titanium alloy surface and facilitates antimicrobial peptide aggre- gation when forming the controllable release antimi- crobial peptide coating.", "type": "Document"}}
