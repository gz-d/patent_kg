The antimicrobial compound may include, but is not limited to, an antibacte- rial, an antifungal, an antiviral, or an antiparasitic. For example, the composition of the present invention may be applied as an antimicrobial coating for the prevention or treatment of clinical skin and wound infections, such as infections caused by gram-positive bacteria and/or gram- negative bacteria.\n\nhydrophobic material provided the composition with sus- tained release properties. The sustained release properties of the composition was analysed by comparing the amount of release of the hydrophobic material, particularly essential oil, in the composition compared to pure essential oil by calculating the change in mass (%) over time. Compared to pure essential oil which had approximately 40% reduction of the original mass at 100 days, the release amount from the composition of the present invention was found to be much lower, with a mass of 85-90% left at 100 days, demonstrat- ing long-term stability of the composition in air. Release of essential oil in water was also investigated and the cumu- lative release of essential oil from the composition could last for up to 60 days (approximately 30% to 45% cumulative telease), advantageously demonstrating controlled release properties of essential oil when encapsulated into the com-\n\n[0106] Ina further embodiment, the hydrophobic material includes a pharmaceutically active ingredient and the com- position can be used to prepare a sustained release dosage form for various medical purposes.", "type": "Document"}}
