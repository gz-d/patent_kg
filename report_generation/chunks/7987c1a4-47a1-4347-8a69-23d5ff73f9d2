The workspace 10 may be surrounded by the electromagnetic devices 102 and 104. The workspace 10 is where the actuation subject is driven under magnetic field so as to be migrating. The workspace 10 may be shaped as a sphere, a spheroid, or an irregular configu- ration.\n\n[0048] By way of example, each electromagnetic device may be designed such that its one part can be moved linearly relative to another part to modify the workspace 10, such as changing size, shape, volume, etc. of the workspace 10. The size may be represented by the diameter of the smallest sphere that can enclose the workspace. The size may be represented in other manners, such as by the longest distance from one point to another point in the workspace. The size\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\ncan be, for example, from 100 mm to 220\n\nsuch as 100\n\nmm, mm, 160 mm, 200 mm, 220 mm. In some embodiments, the size may be larger than 220 mm, such as 300 mm.\n\n[0049] FIGS. 2A-2B illustrate an electromagnetic device 200 according to certain embodiments of the present inven- tion. The electromagnetic device 200, for example, can be a specific implementation of electromagnetic device 102 or 104 with reference to FIG. 1.\n\n[0050] As illustrated, the electromagnetic device 200 includes an elongated sleeve 210, a magnetic core 220, and an electric coil 230. The elongated sleeve 210 defines a hollow space 212. In the present embodiment, the elongate: sleeve 210 is formed as a hollow cylinder. The elongate sleeve 210 may be shaped differently in other embodiments as long as it forms a hollow space or cavity.", "type": "Document"}}
