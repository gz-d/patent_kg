For local field potential (LFP), same neurospike channel was split in two copies so the inventors could record the neurospike and LFP of same neuron synchronized with time.\n\nallowed to move freely and the EMG signals produced during the movement were recorded. The recorded file was opened in SPIKE 2 software and processed using the func- tion of channel process. Data was rectified, smoothened. A median filter and root mean square (RMS) amplitude func- tion were also applied. The inventors then first optimized EMG of gastrocnemius (GCM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle to define the phase of gait cycle based on the EMG activity, particularly the swing and stance phase. The stance time was also calculated.\n\n[0099] Referring to FIGS. 5A and 5B, raw traces synchronized EMG with DCN and LFP recording showed DKO mice had rapid increase in the neuronal firing and total power of LFP synchronously with the peak of the EMG as compared with the control group (n=5-7).\n\nSynchronization of EMG with Video Kinematics", "type": "Document"}}
