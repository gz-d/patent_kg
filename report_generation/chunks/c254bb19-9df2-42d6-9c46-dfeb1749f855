This consists of three row-inverter legs (each consisting of a totem-pole switching pair) and three column-inverter legs. For example, in order to select the middle winding for excitation, the middle row-inverter and the middle column-inverter can be switched to generate ac power excitation.\n\nThe load-dependent selection of the transmitter windings illustrated with the aid of FIG. 7 which shows four elec- tronic loads (illustrated by circular receiver windings 8) are placed on an array of hexagonal transmitter windings 7.
