In some examples, the AC short termination arrangement of the third circuit arrange- ment comprises a grounded capacitive arrangement electri- cally connected in series with the transmission line arrange- ment. In some examples, the grounded capacitive arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a grounded capacitor. In some examples, the transmission line arrange- ment of the third circuit arrangement comprises, or consists only of: a first transmission line portion with an end elec- trically connected in series with the AC short termination arrangement, and a second transmission line portion extend- ing from the first transmission line portion and electrically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. A DC supply voltage may be applied between the first transmission line portion and the AC short termination arrangement. In some examples, the first transmission line portion is straight. In some examples, the second transmission line portion is straight. In some examples, the first and second transmission\n\nline portions are generally perpendicular.", "type": "Document"}}
