Specifically, the electronic skin includes the aforementioned biomimetic, nanofiber-based and directional moisture-wicking wearable electronic fabric with the hydrophobic nanofiber layer con- tacting human skin.\n\n[0035] In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator, including the aforementioned biomimetic, nanofiber-based and directional moisture-wicking wearable electronic fabric and one or more electrodes positioned on the conductive layer, is provided. It is worth noting that the single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator has a response time between 20 to 30 milliseconds, a recovery time between 30 to 40 milliseconds and an areal power density ranging from 0 to 21.6 pW m-2.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0036] described in more details hereinafter with reference to the drawings, in which:\n\nEmbodiments\n\nof the invention\n\nare", "type": "Document"}}
