The semiconductor elements 112, 114 are interconnected by the conductor members 116. As shown in FIG. 1A, the semi- conductor elements 112, 114 and the conductor members 116 are positioned on the substrate 102 to form an undulat- ing pattern along the substrate 102. In the illustrate example in FIG. 1A, the semiconductor elements (i.e. the thermo- electric modules) and the conductor members are positioned to form repeating U shaped patterns on the substrate 102. The first electrode 104 and the second electrode 106 can be connected to wires to transmit current away from the ther- moelectric device 100. The current generated by the ther- moelectric modules 110-110C is conducted through the thermoelectric modules, conductor members 116 to the first and second electrode. A load can be connected to the first and second electrodes 104, 106 to receive the current and power the load.\n\n[0149] As shown in the example configuration of FIG. 1A, the thermoelectric device 100 comprises a plurality of p type and n type semiconductor elements (i.e. a plurality of thermoelectric modules positioned adjacent each other, wherein each thermoelectric module comprises at least a p type semiconductor element and a n type semiconductor element). The p type semiconductor elements 112 and n type semiconductor elements 114 are arranged in an alternating layout on the flexible substrate 102, such that one p type semiconductor element is located adjacent a n type semi- conductor element in the alternating arrangement. Similarly, the thermoelectric device 100 comprises a plurality of conductor members, wherein adjacent p type semiconductor elements and n type semiconductor elements are coupled together by a conductor element i.e. a p type semiconductor element is coupled to an adjacent n type semiconductor element by a conductor member.", "type": "Document"}}
