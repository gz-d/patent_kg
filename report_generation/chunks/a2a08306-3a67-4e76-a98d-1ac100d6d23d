However, for prolonged use in a human body, deterioration of the corrosion resistance of the materials becomes a critical issue, because of the possibility of deleterious ions released from the substrate to living tis- sues. Therefore, we suggested the use of plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition and related ion-beam and lasma-based techniques to implant some other elements, such as C,H,, N,, and O,, into NiTi substrates to alter corro- sion resistance and wear properties of the alloys. We have successfully demonstrated that the corrosion resistance and wear properties of nickel titanium shape memory alloys can be enhanced by implanting nitrogen, carbon and oxygen onto the substrate surface. Additionally, with the use of plasma immersion ion implantation or deposition, the biological roperties such as osteoconductivity and hydrophilicity can also be reduced or enhanced.", "type": "Document"}}
