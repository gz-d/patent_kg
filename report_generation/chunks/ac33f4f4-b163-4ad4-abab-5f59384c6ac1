The correction device is capable of providing a constant and controllable correction force, which can be applied to the deformed spine portion. Such a correction force can be maintained at a constant or substantially constant level until the spinal deformities are corrected. For example, the correction device can be formed by using the pseudoelastic or superelastic properties of a material, such as a NiTi alloy, to provide a constant or sub- stantially constant and controllable correction force. The cor- rection device is capable of completely correcting the spinal deformity at the time of operation or gradually correcting the spinal deformity both during and after the operation. Addi- tionally or alternatively, the correction device can apply a constant or substantially constant correction force subsequent to the surgery, allowing a gradual correction of the spinal\n\ndoelastic materials that are capable of providing a constant correction force. For example, a superelastic or pseudoelastic material can be formed by mechanically deform or otherwise ysically deform a material beyond its elastic limit but within its plastic limit. The material can be allowed to return to the body temperature through heating or gradual warming using any conventional heating mean. Transformation will occur when the material returns to its initial shape to thereby form a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, which can be used for correcting spinal deformities. The transformation can take place instantaneously or over a period of time from several minutes to days. The correction force generated by such a superelastic or pseudoelastic material can maintain a constant or substantially constant level when such a super- elastic or pseudoelastic material is subject to deformation within the range of the elastic limit and the plastic limit of the ue]\n\n40\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
