Furthermore, since the receiving portions RP of the receiving electrode layer 114 are arranged along a curved path, which can conform/fit to the shape of the wearer\u2019s TG finger, the signal measured/ sensed/detected by the detector DD of the present invention can more accurately respond to a movement event caused by fingers of the wearer TG.\n\nGiven the input electrical electrode layer 116, the out K receiving electrode following equation (1). signal as V, to the transmitting ut electrical signal as V,* from portion RP is formulated by the\n\nthe\n\n\u4eba 0 \u8aaa = \u5404 + \u4e00 \u4e00 \u4e00 \u4e00 Ch + Chg Cr 50\n\nWhere C,,* represents a capacitance between the ke receiv- ing electrode portion RP of the receiving electrode layer 114 and the transmitting electrode layer 116, C,\u00a2* represents a capacitance between the k* receiving electrode portion RP of the receiving electrode layer 114 and the ground electrode layer 116, and C,,;\u201c is a capacitance between the k\" receiving electrode portion RP of the receiving electrode layer 114 and wearer\u2019s TG finger.\n\nThe capacitance C between two electrodes is given by equation (2).\n\nfollowing\n\nthe\n\nA \u4eba)\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n65", "type": "Document"}}
