In an aspect, a zero-crossing controller com- ponent can supply a relatively small positive voltage signal to a non-inverting input of a comparator associated with the at least one power switch to facilitate ensuring that the at least one power switch is turned of at or near the zero-crossing point, wherein the comparator can be employed to facilitate controlling switching of the at least one power switch com- ponent. The zero-crossing controller component can thereby facilitate preventing an undesirable short circuit situation in the rectifier.\n\nTurning to FIG. 35, illustrated is an example methodology 3500 that can facilitate rectifying an input power signal in accordance with various aspects of the disclosed subject mat- ter. The methodology 3500 can be utilized in single-phase and multi-phase systems. At 3502, an input power signal (e.g., high power signal, such as 110 volts or 220 volts) can be received by a synchronous rectifier (e.g., SDSR).\n\nAt 3504, during at least a start-up phase of operation when SDGD system associated with the synchronous rectifier is not operating at steady state, switching of the subset of power switches can be controlled to maintain the subset of power switches in an off state.", "type": "Document"}}
