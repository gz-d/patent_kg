An AC-DC flyback converter comprising (diode bridge 2 and gate driver 3) operating under a voltage-control mode is illustrated here. Sensing resistor Rsen is used to monitor the current feeding the inverter. This sensed current signal is filtered by a resistive-capacitive filter and then compared with reference value (Vref\u2014which is arbitrarily set at 2.5V and represents the desired current value in the inverter) in an error amplifier 4, which generates an error signal in its output. This current error signal (Ve) is then fed to a comparator 5 and compared with a sawtooth reference signal (Vsw) that is set at specific frequency which determines the switching fre- quency of the first-stage AC-DC flyback converter. The out- put of this comparator provides the PWM signal for switching the power converter. The duty cycle of this PWM signal controls the output voltage of the flyback converter (i.e. the DC-link voltage Vdc). Vde is controlled in a manner that keeps the current flowing into the inverter to the desired value within a certain small tolerance. The second-stage inverter is simply driven at constant frequency (at the resonant fre- quency of the resonant tank in the primary circuit) to inject an AC current of constant magnitude into the primary circuit of the charging pad. The resonant tank of the primary circuit ensures that current in the primary winding(s) of an active group is sinusoidal in order to reduce harmonic losses and", "type": "Document"}}
