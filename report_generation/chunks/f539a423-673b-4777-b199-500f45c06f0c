The feed probe may be connected to a center of the patch. In one example, the patch includes a central circular portion and a plurality of radially extending portions extend- ing from the central circular portion. In one example, the number of radially extending portions is an even number. Each of the plurality of radially extending portions may be connected to the ground plane through a respective via that extends through the first substrate layer. Preferably, the radially extending portions are angularly spaced apart\n\n[0008] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first resonant mode is TM mode. In one example, the first resonant mode is TM,,, mode. The first resonant mode may alternatively be TE mode, monopole antenna mode, or loop antenna mode.\n\n[0020] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the second network portion includes a plurality of arc-shaped patches arranged on a circular trajectory. The plurality of arc-shaped patches is operably connected with the ground plane and the microstrip line network. The microstrip line network may include a power combining-dividing network and a second microstrip line for connection with a second probe.\n\n[0009] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the second resonant mode is TE mode. In one example, the second resonant mode is TE,,,,, mode. The second resonant mode may alternatively be TM mode, monopole antenna mode, or loop antenna mode.\n\n[0010] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first resonant mode is TM mode (e.g., TM,,3 mode) and the second resonant mode is TE mode (e.g., TE,,5,, mode). Other antenna modes are also possible.\n\n[0021] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the power combining-dividing network comprises a plurality of each corresponding to a respective arc-shaped\n\nis\n\nand\n\n[0007]\n\nIn accordance with a first aspect of the invention,", "type": "Document"}}
