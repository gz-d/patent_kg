However, some example linear precoders may be of high complexity which hinders the applicability of linear precoding in transmitters.\n\nwhere f,,,(Z) denotes the p-th polyphase component of the k-th filter f,(z) and L,. denotes the order of the equalizer F(z).\n\n[0045] Similarly, the block filter matrix H(z) is the equiva- finite impulse response (FIR) channel h(z) in (1) for polyphase representation of the precoder and equalizer sys- tem, referring to FIG. 2.\n\n[0040] With reference to FIG. 1, there is shown an example embodiment of a wireless communication system 100, comprising a wireless signal transmitter 202 and a wireless signal receiver 104. In addition, the transmitter end is further provided with a digital precoder equalizer for processing the signal before transmitting it to the receiver end through one or more antennas. In some applications, multiple antennas on both transmitter and receiver ends may be used in communication signals using multiple bands or a plurality of sub-channels, and the signals may be transmitted in form of electromagnetic signals, such as radio frequency (RF) signals.\n\nhols) Mp-a@) Zh) \u7684 \u76f8 (0 0(2) zh HQ) = : : hpo(z) ps ot hp sl) Apa(z) hpoolz) i ho(z)", "type": "Document"}}
