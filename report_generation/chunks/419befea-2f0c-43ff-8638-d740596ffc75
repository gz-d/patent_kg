Alternatively, the p type semiconductor element may comprise Bismuth Antimony Telluride (Bi, ;Sb, ;Te3). In the illustrated example of FIGS. 1A and 1B, the n type semiconductor element comprises Lead Telluride (PbTe). Alternatively, the n type semiconductor elements may com- prise Bismuth Telluride(Bi,Te,). Preferably the p type semi- conductor elements are identical in size, shape and material across the multiple thermoelectric modules. Preferably the n type semiconductor elements are identical in size, shape and material between the multiple thermoelectric modules.\n\n[0139] The polyimide material of the flexible substrate 102 is advantageous because of its high temperature stabil- ity. Further polyimide has a flexural modulus and a Youngs modulus that allows the substrate to bend and flex about curved surfaces. In alternative configurations the flexible substrate 102 may comprise Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polycarbonate, Polypropylene, Polyethylene, Poly- vinyl chloride(PVC). These materials may be formed into a flexible sheet that has a flexural modulus that is low enough to allow the sheet to bend or be wrapped about a curved surface. The flexible substrate is advantageous because it can be flexed and bent.\n\n[0145] The p type semiconductor element 112 and n type semiconductor element 114, of each thermoelectric module comprise a thin film having a thickness between 50 nm to 150 nm. Preferably the p type semiconductor element 112 and n type semiconductor element 114 comprise a thickness of 100 nm.", "type": "Document"}}
