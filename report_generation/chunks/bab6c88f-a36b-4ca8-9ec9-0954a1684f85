CRYSTALS-Dil- ithium is a lattice-based post-quantum digital signature scheme that may resists attacks by quantum computers, which was selected for final standardization in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization pro- cess. However, such advanced digital signature scheme involves complex and time-consuming computation of data which highly affect the speed performance and design flexibility of the Dilithium-based\n\ncryptosystem.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIn In accordance with\n\nfirst\n\nthe\n\n[0004] a aspect of present invention, there is provided a processor for a cryptosystem, comprising a hybrid processor architecture including a hard- ware processor, a software processor and an interconnection interface arranged to exchange data between the hardware processor and the software processor; wherein the hardware processor comprises a plurality of hardware accelerator modules arranged to perform computational tasks including at least one of number theoretic transforms (NTT) compu- tation, arithmetic operations which are more time-consum- ing when being performed instead by the software-proces- sor.\n\n[0005] In accordance with the first aspect, the intercon- nection interface includes a high-performance interface and general-purpose low performance interface arranged to exchange difference types of data between the hardware processor and the software processor.\n\na\n\n[0006] In accordance with the first aspect, the intercon- nection interface includes an AXI memory interconnect and an AX] lite peripheral interconnect operable as the high- performance interface and the general-purpose low perfor- mance interface respectively.", "type": "Document"}}
