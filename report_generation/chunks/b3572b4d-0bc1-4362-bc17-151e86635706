To that end, solar energy collection antennas are described. comprising one or more of a reflective ground plane and a reflective antenna element that can direct incident solar radia- tion to one or more solar cells. In a non-limiting aspect, non-planar reflective ground planes, such as a V-shaped and a U-shaped reflective ground plane, are described. In further non-limiting embodiments, solar energy collection antennas are described comprising a selective transmission layer adja- cent to one or more solar cells that can transmit incident solar radiation to the one or more solar cells while selectively reflecting communication signals to a communication antenna. In a further non-limiting aspect, conformal solar cells located adjacent to a reflector structure of an antenna are\n\nFIGS. 12-13 depict simulated and measured normalized radiation patterns of an exemplary non-limiting single-ele- ment SPA, where FIG. 12 depicts simulated and measured normalized radiation patterns in an electric field reference lane (E-plane), and FIG. 13 depicts simulated and measured normalized radiation patterns in a magnetizing field reference lane (H-plane);\n\nFIG. 14 illustrates a top view of a non-limiting one-to-three Wilkinson power divider suitable for use with exemplary implementations of the disclosed subject matter;\n\nFIGS. 15-16 depict measured scattering parameters rameters) of a non-limiting one-to-three-way Wilkinson ower divider;\n\nFIGS. 17-18 illustrate exemplary non-limiting functional lock diagrams of embodiments of GA systems, suitable employing implementations of the disclosed subject matter;", "type": "Document"}}
