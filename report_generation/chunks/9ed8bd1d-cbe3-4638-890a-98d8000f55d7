In one example, the aqueous electrolytic solution may include at least one of a salt, an acid or a surfactant additives.\n\n[0188] In another example, the cathode may be a cathode in which the active material PPy is electrodeposited onto a CNT paper using the same procedure as the PPy anode.\n\n[0197] In this example, the cured hydrogel may be soaked into an aqueous electrolytic solution containing zinc(II) sulphate at a concentration of for example 2 mol L7' and manganese(II) sulphate at a concentration of for example 0.2 mol L7*, 30 wt % of EG, and 0.1 mol L~' of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (i.e. surfactant) for 1 h at room temperature. This may allow ion exchange between the internal of hydrogel and the external solution. In addition, the ionic crosslinks may form between adjacent alginate chains through the interactions with Zna+ and/or Mn?* ions. Also, any excess Zn?* and/or Mn?* ions may contribute to ion transport for the electrolyte. Furthermore, the surfactant may facilitate the solvation and hydrolysis of the coupling agents in the interfacial layer of the aforementioned hydrogel 200 and the polymeric layer 201, thereby facilitating the cou- pling reaction therebetween.\n\n[0189] In yet another example, the cathode may be a LiMn,0, (LMO) cathode. The active material LMO may be deposited on a substrate such as SS mesh. In particular, the LMO may form a slurry with a conductive material and a binder under a predetermined weight ratio with an aid of a solvent. In this example, the solvent, the conductive mate- rial, and the binder may be acetone, acetylene blacks, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), respectively. The slurry may be uniformly deposited onto the SS mesh using a blade.\n\n[0190] It is appreciated that the steps of forming the anode and the cathode may be reversed (i.e. forming the cathode prior to forming the anode) or may be performed simulta- neously.", "type": "Document"}}
