Under similar surface charges, the TIDE-G devices made of PDMS and PP exhibit comparable initial output to that of TIDE-G made of PTFE. However, distinct from the latter, the output in both devices made of PP and PDMS exhibits a rapid decay, partly due to the relatively poor charge stability.\n\nFIG. 17 is a graph showing thickness of PTFE film as a function of volume of PTFE precursor. The thickness of PTFE film linearly increases from 6.7 um to 16.9 um with the volume of PTFE precursor increases from 100 HL to 250 UL.\n\nof\n\nFIG. 18 is a schematic diagram showing negative and positive charges fixed on the atomic layers PTFE and the ITO electrode, respectively.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION\n\nWater energy is one of the most abundant, affordable and sustainable sources on earth. As the demand for sustainable and renewable energy is ever increasing, the pursuit of new strategies to achieve efficient electricity generation from green and recyclable sources such as raindrops has received increasing attention. In spite of extensive progress, efficiently harvesting the hydrodynamic energy of droplets remains challenging. For example, to date, the output power density of liquid/solid based triboelectric nano-generator (TENG) is less than 1 W/m* owing to the limitation imposed by the interfacial effect, as characterized by the charge generation and transfer occurring at the solid/liquid or liquid/liquid interfaces. Thus, the present invention timely to provide new approaches that fundamentally overcome the limitation of the interfacial effect.", "type": "Document"}}
