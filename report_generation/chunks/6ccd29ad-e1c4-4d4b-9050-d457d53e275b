The electrolyte for use in an electrical energy storage device according to claim 2, wherein the hydrogel comprises a polymer matrix including at least two crosslinked struc- tures having a second polymeric material and a third poly- meric material.\n\n[0245] The electrical energy storage device of the present invention such as the battery 100/100\u2019 is advantageous since it is adapted to different harsh and extreme conditions while the electrochemical performance of the device is main- tained. For example, the battery has a capacity retention of 84.6% when the battery is operated at 80\u00b0 C. Even operating at -20\u00b0 C., the battery is still capable of delivering a capacity retention of 70%. The battery is also operable to power a digital timer when the battery is immersed in boiling water or sealed in ice. All these features suggest the excellent applicability of the electrical energy storage device of the present invention.\n\n4. The electrolyte for use in an electrical energy storage device according to claim 3, wherein the plurality of poly- mer chains of the first polymeric material are functionalized with a first coupling agent such that the polymer chains of the first polymeric material form a covalent bond with a plurality of polymer chains of the second polymeric material defining a second crosslinked structure of the at least two crosslinked structures of the polymer matrix.\n\n5. The electrolyte for use in an electrical energy storage device according to claim 4, wherein the first coupling includes triethoxy(vinyl)silane (TEOVS).\n\n6. The electrolyte for use in an electrical energy storage device according to claim 2, wherein the first polymeric material is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).\n\n[0246] In addition, on the one hand, the device is highly flexible/soft, rendering it arbitrarily deformable into various irregular shapes as well as the excellent wearing compat- ibility. On the other hand, the device has a high resistance to", "type": "Document"}}
