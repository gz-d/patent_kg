Both structures require same number of operations to compute NTT and INTT in NWC. For the CT structure, the multiplication takes place before the add/subtract operation (i.e. a; tax, a,-a,x@). For the GS structure, the multipli- cation takes places only after subtract operation (i.e. a, +a, (a,-az)x).\n\nUS 2024/0143524 Al\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n[0076]\n\nIn the reference software implementation of Dil-\n\nithium, NTT and INTT may be implemented separately by applying CT structure in NTT and GS structure in INTT. This method could eliminate coefficient-wise multiplica- tions before NTT and coeflicient-wise multiplications after INTT. However, if NTT and INTT are implemented sepa- rately in hardware, it will double the hardware resource usage. For example, a unified BFU, which combined both CT and GS structure in a reconfigurable processor, may be used. Alternatively, the BFU may comprise a unified struc- ture and which further reduces the additional cycle for the multiplication of n~'. The multiplication of n\u20141 is achieved by (x>>1) when x is even or ((x>>1)+(q+1)/2) when when x is odd. Therefore, the unified CT/GS architecture may be used in the following hybrid NTT/INTT algorithm to\n\nAlgorithm 5 Modular Reduction in Z,23_313,;\n\nInput: a[45 : 0] Input: q[22 : 0] = 277-2 +1 Output: r = a mod q 1: c[13 : 0] =al45 : 33] + a[32 : 23] 2: ef 10: 0] =c[13 : 10] + \u00a2[9 : 0] 3: \u00a3[22 :0] = 2'> - (e[10] + e[9 : O}) \u2014 (e[10] + c[13 : 10]) 4 x[23 : 0] = {122 : 0] + a[22 : 0) 5: ifx2q then \u00e9 7 8 x[22 : 0] = x[23 : 0] \u2014 q[22: 0] end if ; [22 : 0] = al45 : 33] + al45 : 23] 9 xD3 : 0] = xI22: 0] \u2014 4122: 0] 10: ifr > q then HM: 1{23 : 0] = 1[23 : 0] \u2014 q[22 : 0] 12: end if\n\nreduces hardware resources and computation time.\n\nAlgorithm 4 Hybrid NTT/INTT Algorithm\n\nInput: a(x) with coefficients fa a,\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. a,}, or 4(x) with coefficients {4), 4, .\n\n. 4,}", "type": "Document"}}
