A\n\nExisting filter-antennas are reflective filter-antennas. These reflective filter-antennas reflect most of the incident energy in the stopband. The reflected energy may be transferred to other components (e.g., a power amplifier associated with the filter-antenna) in the system, which may lead to instability (e.g., self-oscillation in the power amplifier). One option to avoid or mitigate this instability problem is to use isolators, circulators, and/or attenuators in the system to reduce the effect of the reflected energy on the system. However, this option would increase the number of the components in the system, making the system cumbersome and expensive while potentially increasing the insertion loss.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIn accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a filter-antenna, comprising a microstrip antenna integrated with an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. By absorbing or dissipating the energy, e.g., energy received from an external source, reflection of energy (which may otherwise affect stability of other components/devices) can be prevented, reduced, or eliminated. The filter-antenna can be used for transmission, receiving, or both.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip antenna is a patch antenna. The has a relatively low profile.\n\nantenna\n\npatch\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the absorptive filter is a band-stop filter for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip antenna includes a substrate, ground plane arranged a first face of the substrate, and a microstrip network arranged on a second,\n\na\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n2", "type": "Document"}}
