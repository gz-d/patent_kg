Given a maximum water/PTFE contact area Ar of 2.72 cm? and measured charge Q,,,., of 59.3 nC, the voltage established across the PTFE is calculated ~170.9 V, which is consistent with our experimental measurement. This sug- gests the unique roles of the virtual source and the source, which provide ample charges for electricity generation. To further elucidate the reason for the reversible charges release, the detailed charges transfer process was studied. Prior to the contact of the impinging droplet with the drain, ie., in the switching-off mode, there is no EDL formed at the water/drain interface (FIG. 4a). While the PTFE carries sufficient negative charges, the electric field E, established inside PTFE prevents the directional flow of positive charges in bulk water toward the PTFE surface, thereby suppressing the formation of an effective EDL at the liquid/ PTFE interface (i, ii). In contrast, when the PTFE and drain are connected by the spreading droplet (iii), the presence of higher potential on the drain over the PTFE leads to the building of an additional electric field E, within the droplet, thereby transforming the original random motion of ions into a directional flow, with positive and negative ions towards the PTFE surface and drain electrode, respectively. Meanwhile, because the EDL effects at the water/PTFE and water/drain interfaces are stronger than the electrostatic interaction between PTFE and ITO, these positive charges initially inducted on ITO can be released and flow toward the drain electrode (iv-vi). Taken together, these results paint a vivid picture that the PTFE, ITO and spreading droplet indeed serve as the virtual source, source, and gate channel, respectively, all of which seamlessly work together to allow the reversible and efficient charge transfer for the boosted", "type": "Document"}}
