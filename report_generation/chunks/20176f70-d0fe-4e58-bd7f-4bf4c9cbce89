Therefore, an eaves- dropper can recover the information even in the sidelobe region by using a sufficiently sensitive receiver (FIGS. 46 and 47). In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 can provide an inherent directional modulation (IDM) phenomenon at the fundamental frequency. This unique IDM property is attributed to the direction-dependent phase control of the universal metasurface antenna 400 (FIGS. 40 to 43). For validation, a communication link is established, through which the universal metasurface antenna 400 directly emits the modulated waves carrying the 8PSK signals at the fundamental frequency (FIG. 21). FIG. 22\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\npresents the corresponding measured radiation patterns and the decoded constellation diagrams when the receiver is located in different directions. It can be seen that the receiver can only successfully decode the information in the main- beam direction of the universal metasurface antenna (the information is completely lost outside the main beam). This IDM effect may be used to effectively mitigate malicious eavesdropper attacks in different directions, establishing physical-layer security on top of wireless communications. The IDM is an intrinsic property of the universal metasur- face antenna 400 and is free of any optimization and performance trade-off generally incurred for conventional approaches to achieve physically secure communication links.\n\nWave Manipulations with Frequency Shifting", "type": "Document"}}
