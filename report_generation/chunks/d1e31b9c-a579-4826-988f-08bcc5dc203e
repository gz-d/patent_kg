This process is\n\ncalled entropy encoding. For example, after quantization,\n\nThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus for\n\nmany of the coefficients may have a value of Zero; a type of\n\ncalculating the sum of squared differences between an origi\n\nentropy encoding called run-length coding, takes account of\n\nnal block and a reconstructed block of image or video data\n\nconsecutive Zero coefficients and encodes the length of each\n\nand/or a method and apparatus for determining the distortion\n\n10\n\nSuch run, rather than encoding each Zero value separately.\n\ncaused by encoding a block of image or video data. The\n\nOther types of entropy encoding which take advantage of the\n\npresent invention also proposes an apparatus and method for\n\nstatistical properties of the data, for example variable length\n\nencoding image or video data, in which an appropriate encod\n\nencoding (VLC) or arithmetic coding, may also be used.
