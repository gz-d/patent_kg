To test the stability of the complexes in the dark, PBS buffer (10 mM Na,HPO,, KH,PO,, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH=7.4) at the final concentration of 10 1M complex with or without ascorbate (2 mM) is incubated in a shaker at 37\u00b0 C. HPLC analysis is performed at a pre-defined time.\n\n[0137] The results are shown in FIG. 24. FIG. 24A shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatogram of complex 4 (10 1M), FIG. 24B shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatogram of complex 5 (10 PM), FIG. 24C shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatogram of complex 6 (10 11M), and FIG. 24D shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatogram of complex 7 (10 1M).
