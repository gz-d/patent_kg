Preferably, it is a mammalian expression vector.\n\n[0015] In another aspect, the invention further provides a composition comprising: the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx and/or the expression vector for express- ing the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx, as well as a gRNA targeting the target IncRNA.\n\n[0016] In another aspect, the invention further provides a kit for determining IncRNA interaction proteins, compris- ing: the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx and/or the expression vector for expressing the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx, as well as a gRNA targeting the target IncRNA. Preferably, the kit further comprises a control reagent without gRNA (for example, co-transfected with the gRNA empty vector and the BASU-dCasRx fusion protein expression vector).\n\n[0017] In another aspect, the present invention further provides a method for determining IncRNA interaction proteins, comprising:\n\n[0018] co-transfecting the expression vector for express- ing the fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx, and gRNA that specifically targets the target IncRNA in a target cell, thereby BASU specifically biotin-labeling effector pro- teins nearby;\n\n[0019] isolating the biotinylated proteins for analysis to determine the IncRNA interaction proteins.", "type": "Document"}}
