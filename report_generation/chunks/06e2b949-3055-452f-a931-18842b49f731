As shown in FIG. 5, the measured result generally agrees with the simulated result. The measured reflection coeflicient is below -10 dB over the entire frequency range (5-6.5 GHz). This demonstrates the reflection-less characteristic of the filter-antenna 400. It is noted that the reflection coefficient of the filter-antenna 400 does not have a sharp selectivity. For comparison, a con- ventional rectangular patch antenna having the same length of L, and width of W, is included here as the reference antenna. Its simulated reflection coefficient is also shown in FIG. 5. It can be seen from FIG. 5 that the impedance bandwidth of the reference antenna is much narrower than that of the filter-antenna 400 although the reference antenna and filter-antenna 400 have the size.\n\ngenerally provided a filter-antenna that can effectively reduce reflection of energy, in particular energy in the stopband. The filter-antenna is compact, low-profile, and small, and is suitable for miniature communication devices and systems. The above embodiments of the invention can be used in the wireless transmitter to reduce the system size and loss. The filter-antenna in the above embodiment has four radiation nulls that can be tuned independently to facilitate the design. A resistor-terminated band-stop filter is embedded at the center of the patch antenna to absorb the energy in the stopbands. The band-stop filter consists of a defected ground structure, a defected microstrip structure, along with the chip resistor. Good impedance matching is achieved in the and in the", "type": "Document"}}
