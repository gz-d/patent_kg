In addi- tion, the compensated output signal i, is received as an input to the controller stage 216 and used in a comparison to the reference current signal I,,-to derive the control variable for controlling the current regulator 210 to track the reference current signal I,\u00bb Consequently, the dual effects of using the compensation signal to counter the ripple current signal in the output current signal and using the compensation signal as an input to the controller stage 216 for determining the control signal enables the output current signal of the current regula-\n\nwhich when summed with the output voltage signal of results in a compensated output voltage signal of\n\nrer\n\nConsequently, it can be seen that the application of the compensating voltage signal of v,, from the voltage signal source 124 of the compensator circuit 122 does not require any change to the control feedback loop 132 of the voltage regulator 110. Thus, the normal operation of the original voltage regulation mechanism of the voltage regulator 110, that is the feedback loop 132 of the voltage regulator 110, is not affected.", "type": "Document"}}
