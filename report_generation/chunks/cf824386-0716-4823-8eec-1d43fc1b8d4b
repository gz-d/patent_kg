In this embodiment four layers of square-spiral winding arrays are used to generate highly uniform mmf over the surface. As in the hexagonal embodiment described above, for convenience of illustration each Square-spiral winding pattern (Fig.26) is simplified as a square symbol (Fig.27) in the following\n\ndescription.\n\nFig.28 shows the first layer of the square-spiral winding array, The myin the central region of each square patter is highest. These regions are highlighted as \u2018Peak\u2019 or (P) in Fig.29The regions of the minimum mmf (i.e. the valleys) occurs along the edges of the square patterns. These regions are highlighted with dots (*) in Fig.29,\n\nIn order to reduce the mmf ripples on the surface, the peak (P) positions of a second layer of square-spiral winding array can placed over some of the valley positions (*) as shown in Fig.30. When a third layer of square-spiral winding array is added to the structure in Fig.30, the resultant layout is shown in Fig.31. It can now be observed that one more layer of the square-spiral windings is needed fill with\n\nto\n\nup all the valleys\n\npcaks as shown in Fig.32,\n\n15\n\nCLAIMS\n\nApparatus for the transfer of energy by electrical induction comprising 3 primary induction unit formed with a planar surface for receiving at least one secondary element to which energy is to be transferred, wherein said primary induction unit comprises an erray of primary transformer windings so as to provide a substantially uniform magnetic flux distribution over said planar surface.\n\nApparatus as claimed in claim 1 comprising at least two planar arrays of primary wherein one said planar array overlies the other said array,\n\n10", "type": "Document"}}
