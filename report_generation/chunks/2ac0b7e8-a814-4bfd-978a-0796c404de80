Based on relationship, the spatial-domain SSD(S,C) can be expressed differential-domain SSD(D,D):\n\nSSD(S,C)=|S-C]|p\u00b0=|D+P-D-P|p?=||D-D]|p?=SSD (DD) (EQUATION\n\nThat means the spatial-domain SSD(S,C) is equivalent differential-domain SSD(D,D)). Based on this relationship, can calculate the rate distortion cost in the differential- domain with Jpn=SSD(D,D)+)-R, which avoids computing reconstructed image block (C=D+P).\n\n2.2 Transform-Domain SSD\n\nBefore we define the transform-domain SSD, we need emphasize that the DCT matrix Tp; used in MPEG-like H.264/AVC video coding is a unitary matrix, which has property [16] of:\n\n(We ZbexXTpcr\u201clle\n\n(EQUATION 13)\n\nwhere X is a square matrix. As the DCT matrix Tyo is unitary matrix, it is also possible to perform an inverse trans- form. According to Equations 12 and 13, we can also express SSD in transform-domain as:\n\nAccordingly, a preferred embodiment of the present inven- tion proposes a new fast sum of squared difference (FSSD) computation algorithm which uses an iterative table-lookup quantization process. This may reduce the complexity of the H.264 rate-distortion cost function calculation with good coding efficiency as compared with conventional methods of rate-distortion optimization. The proposed algorithm can also be combined with fast bit-rate estimation algorithm to further speed up the computation with minimal performance degra- dation.\n\nSSDS, C) = p- All.
