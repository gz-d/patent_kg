All the Peltier modules are driven using a custom- designed H-bridge driver module (Model No.: L298N) shield and an Arduino Mega micro-controller, with an external switching mode power supply. Each Peltier module draws a maximum of 400 mA at 6V during the stimulation. The system was controlled by the Arduino Mega connected to a laptop through USB, to ensure the fine control of the temperature through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM Ther- mal stimuli was activated for approximately 1.5 s (on for approximately 1.5 s and then switched off), for a comfort- able yet perceivable temperature feedback. With the full duty cycle of PWM (255), the Peltier module can change its surface temperature with the temperature-changing rate of 3.5\u00b0 C./s, increase/reduce 5.25\u00b0 C. within 1.5 s. The duty cycle mainly controls the changing rate. The range of temperature depends on the user\u2019s skin temperature. Given the changing rate of 3.5\u00b0 C. per second and the skin of 35\u00b0 C. the of after 1.5 s\n\ntemperature range would be 29.75-40.25\u00b0 C.\n\ntemperature\n\n[0056] The present invention can output thermal feedback to auricular areas behind the ear based on selected pre- defined thermal patterns. The thermal feedback mechanism is based on the Peltier effect. The thermal feedback (hot and cold) may be achieved with the help of the several \u201ccouples\u201d of bismuth telluride dices (may be effectively called as a Peltier modules) or, in the alternative, other materials with a high thermoelectric effect, that are layered on one side of the earhook device.\n\nEXAMPLES", "type": "Document"}}
