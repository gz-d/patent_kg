By providing the transistor drain a resistive load at 3fo, the induced third harmonic voltage Vz 3fo can improve the II, fol as shown in FIG. 9B, which can boost the fundamental oscillator amplitude. The improved |V_,_f5| can then increase II, 31, as shown in FIG. 7B, leading to a positive feedback loop for boosting the third harmonic output power. The loop can finally remain stable under a high |V, 3fol because II, 3f, decreases as IV, 3fol increases, as shown in FIG. 9B.\n\n[0178] In addition, from FIG. 8B, it is found that if the second harmonic voltage is induced with the proper phase at the drain, the third harmonic current will be decreased and lead to the third harmonic output power drop. To relieve this effect, the second harmonic current generation can be reduced by simultaneously driving the transistor into cut-o. and triode transition, as shown in FIG. 7B. Shorting the second harmonic or providing reactive loading at 2fo to shift the phase of induced voltage can also relieve 3fo current reduction.\n\n[0179] In summary, large fundamental driving voltages at the transistor gate and drain can improve the third harmonic current generation. Proper resistive loading of the transistor drain at the third harmonic is useful to boost the third harmonic output and extract the harmonic power. Moreover, minimizing second harmonic current can avoid third har- monic current output reduction.", "type": "Document"}}
