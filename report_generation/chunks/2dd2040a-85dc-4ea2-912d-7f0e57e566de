FIGURE 8A shows the average probability of the two groups being in the preference-biased period throughout a trial. FIGURE 8B shows the probability distribution of number of fixations in the exploration period, and number of fixations in the preference- biased period. The vertical bars indicate standard errors.\n\nThe results showed that for both\n\nthe probability of being in the preference-\n\ngroups, biased period increased soon after a trial began. To test the hypothesis that group A and group B had different probabilities across the time segments, a mixed ANOVA on probability of being in the preference-biased period with time segment as the within-subject variable and group as the between-subject variable was conducted. The results showed a significant time segment effect, F(1.384, 30.445) = 339.091, p < .001, mp = 0.939, a significant group effect, F(1 22) = 7.770, p = 0.011, and a significant interaction between group and time segment, F(1.384, 30.445) = 10.064, p = .001, np = 0.314. These results indicated that in general group B had higher probability to be in preference-biased period than group A, especially in the beginning time segments of a trial (FIGURE 8A). Although group A entered the preference- biased period later, group A had a stronger gaze cascade effect. In contrast, group B entered the but had weaker cascade effect.\n\npreference-biased period earlier,\n\na\n\ngaze", "type": "Document"}}
