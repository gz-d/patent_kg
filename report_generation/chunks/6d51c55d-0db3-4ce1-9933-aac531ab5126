The analysis revealed that a variety of biological processes, such as cellular lipid catabolic process and acyl-CoA metabolic process, were significantly enriched.\n\n[0078] These experiments confirm that KPlip is a reliable for chemical proteomics to dissect proteins interacting with lipoylated lysine.\n\n[0073] Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2), a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC), was identi- fied following the analysis as a promising KPlip-binding protein.\n\nExample 5: Delipoylation Study with Probe KTlip\n\n[0079] After confirming the interactions of Sirt2 and the lipoylated peptide of the present invention in a cellular context, the capability of Sirt2 to remove a lipoyl modifi- cation was investigated. To this end, a fluorescent probe of the present invention detected delipoylation activity. Com- pared with mass spectrometry, radioisotopes, specific anti- bodies, and HPLC, fluorescent probes possess prominent advantages in detecting enzyme activity, such as high sen- sitivity and simple procedure. Previously, no single-step fluorescent probe has been developed to report delipoylation activity. It has been difficult to design single-step fluorescent probes for detecting deacylation activity because the ali- phatic amide structure in the Kacy] group does not allow conjugation to a fluorophore.\n\nExample 3: In-Gel Labelling of KPlip", "type": "Document"}}
