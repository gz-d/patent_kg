The substrate of the antenna can be formed by one or more substrate layers, the same or different dielectric constants (\u20ac;s). The dielectric constant of the substrate layer can vary. The shape, form, and size of the substrate; the shape, form, and size of the ground plane; and shape, form, and size of the microstrip network or patch network can be different. The patch network can have any number of (at least one) patches with any of shape and form. The patch(es) need not necessarily be arranged symmetrically. The patches could form an array to give an array antenna (integrated with filter). The feed of the antenna can be non-coaxial feed, such microstrip feed. The feed need not be perpendicular to the face of the substrate, but can be parallel at any other angles to the face of the substrate. The filter-antenna can be made with different form factors. The filter-antenna can be used for other radio frequencies (e.g., microwave)\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nor\n\nspecifically mentioned above.\n\nas\n\nnot\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n1]\n\nCLAIMS\n\nA filter-antenna, comprising:\n\na microstrip antenna integrated with an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy.\n\nThe filter-antenna of claim 1, wherein the microstrip antenna is a patch antenna.\n\nThe\n\nfilter-antenna of claim 1, wherein the absorptive filter is a band-stop filter for absorbing dissipating stopband energy.\n\nor\n\nThe filter-antenna of claim 1, wherein the microstrip antenna includes\n\na substrate,\n\na ground plane arranged a first face of the substrate, and\n\na microstrip network arranged on a second, opposite face of the substrate; and\n\nwherein the absorptive filter includes a filter element at least partly arranged inside substrate.\n\nthe\n\nThe filter-antenna of claim 4, wherein the filter element is arranged substantially completely inside the substrate.", "type": "Document"}}
