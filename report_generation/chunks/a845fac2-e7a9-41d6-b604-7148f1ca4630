A\n\n[0078]\n\nmachine learning algorithm (gkm-SVM) based on gap k-mer is adopted in the present invention to train a prediction model with HTR-SELEX data to evaluate the RNA sequence preference of TAF15. Due to computational power, both positive and negative sequences are randomly downsampled to 100,000 sequences. In order to find the best model, the present invention considers three key parameters of gkm-SVM: 1, the length of the entire word includes spaces; k, the number of positions of information (i.e. no gaps) in each word; d, the maximum allowed Number of mismatches. The present invention uses 5-fold cross-vali- dation for parameter combination search. When 1-7, k=3, and d=4, the highest accuracy of cross-validation is 87.3%. Finally, the present invention uses the best model to score all 7-mers occurred in XIST, and draw a smooth gkm-SVM\n\nprediction score along the XIST transcript.\n\n[0079] FIGS. 9a to 9f show the functional verification and SNF2L on XCI, wherein:\n\nTAF15\n\n[0080] FIG. 9a shows that the cells are fixed with 3% PFA solution and then stained with DAPI. The GFP signal observed on the fluorescence microscope under the FITC channel.\n\n[0081] FIG. 9b shows verification of shRNA knockdown efficiency. The iMEF cells are infected with the lentivirus carrying the indicated shRNA. The gene expression level is detected by RT-qPCR. f-actin is used to normalize RNA expression under different conditions. Data is expressed as mean+SD, n=3, ** p<0.01, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test.\n\n[0082] FIG. 9c shows the TAF15 knockdown recovery experiment. The packaged Tafl5 specific shRNA (shTaf15- 44) and anti-shRNA Taf15 virus are used to infect iMEF cells. The expression level of Taf15 is detected by RT-qPCR, and f-actin is used as an internal control. Data is expressed as mean+SD, n=3, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test.", "type": "Document"}}
