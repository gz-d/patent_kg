The bulk alloy of 0.1 g was put into a test tube containing 30 ml of ethylene glycol solvent and 0.5 g of PVP powders, and stirred for 10 min until the PVP powders dissolved completely. The sealed-tube was then placed into an ultrasonic machine and ultrasonicated at 75\u00b0 C. for either 30 min, 60 min, or 120 min. Note that the power of the ultrasonic machine was set at 120 W with a frequency of 40 kHz or 80 kHz. The test tube was cooled to room temperature, then placed in an ice-water bath at about 0\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes to produce a precipitate. The thus-produced precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum-dried oven for 60 minutes to give the present Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder particles.\n\n[0066] Bonding with Substrate Via the Present Sn \u4e00 Bi in Base Solder Particles\n\n[0067] Pure Cu sheets (99% purity, 10 mmx10 mmx2 mum) were first polished by diamond paste (2.5 and 0.5 jum), the polished Cu sheets were ultrasonically cleaned in sequence with acetone, deionized water, and 5.0 vol % hydrochloric acid to remove residual oil and oxidation, followed by additional ultrasonication in deionized water and absolute ethanol for further 3 minutes. 50 mg of flux and. 50 mg of solder particles were placed on the surface of the copper sheet. The solder joints were fabricated by a reflow process, where the samples were reflowed at 100\u00b0 C. for 5 min to form the solder joints.", "type": "Document"}}
