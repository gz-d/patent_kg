The inventors unexpectedly found that modification of the amino acid residues at the N413 position and optionally one or more mutations at the R245, N419 and/or R654 positions decreased nuclease activity at one or more off-target sites on a target DNA molecule, such that non-specific binding and off-target cleavages were reduced without compromising on-target binding. The modified SaCas9 protein of the invention has advantageously enhanced targeting specificity and thus\n\nThe present invention further pertains to a CRIPSR sys- tem comprising a modified SaCas9 protein as described above or a gene encoding said SaCas9 protein, a gRNA as described above, and optionally an inducible promoter.
