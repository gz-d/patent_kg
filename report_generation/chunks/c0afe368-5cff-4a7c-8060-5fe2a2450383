Ber- bamine or its analogue may be contained in a composition, in particular a pharmaceutical composition, in an effective amount, i.e. an amount suitable to treat or prevent the RNA. virus infection particularly flavivirus infection, enterovirus infection or lentivirus infection in a subject, in particular a mammal, which also depends on the frequency and number of compositions to be administered. In an embodiment, the subject is a mammal and berbamine or its analogue may be administered to the subject at a dose of about 20 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, or above. In other embodiment, the subject is human and berbamine or its analogue may be adminis- tered to the subject at a dose of about 20 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, or above.\n\nFormula (IVb)\n\n[0064] When berbamine or its analogue is provided in a pharmaceutical composition to a subject, the skilled person is able to select suitable pharmaceutically tolerable excipi- ents depending on the form of the pharmaceutical compo- sition and is aware of methods for manufacturing pharma- ceutical compositions as well as able to select a suitable method for preparing the pharmaceutical composition depending on the kind of pharmaceutically tolerable excipi- ents and the form of the pharmaceutical composition.", "type": "Document"}}
