The present 3-tier screening system fulfills the criteria for an ideal quantitative angiogenesis assay listed above and provides an effective screening assay system to identify angiogenic modulating agent with least toxicity. The screening system consists of 3 hierarchical tiers: 1) lead identification; 2) gen- eral toxicity test; 3) organ-specific toxicity test. The preferred model of the present invention is zebrafish or medaka embryos. The advantage of the present invention is that it can rapidly identify potential angiogenic modulating agents at the first tier and these potential angiogenic modulating agents then subject to the tier 2 and 3 safety tests respectively. There- fore, the final candidates of the lead agents which pass all the 3 tiers will have the desirable angiogenic activity with the\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
