In FIG. 2, in each row, an even-mode-shorted coupler (\u201cout-of-phase coupler\u201d) can be used to sustain the out-of-phase coupling mode between the two adjacent negative gm (-gm) cells. The even-mode-shorted coupler may include a transmission line arrangement electrically connected between the two adjacent -gm cells in the same row, and a capacitive arrangement electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement and operable to facilitate shorting of even- mode impedance. In this embodiment, the even-mode- shorted coupler includes a coupling transmission line elec- trically connecting two adjacent -gm cells, and a capacitor C, loaded at the center of the coupling transmission line for shorting the even-mode impedance. In each column, an odd-mode-shorted coupler (\u201cin-phase coupler\u201d) can be used to sustain the in-phase coupling mode between the two adjacent -gm cells in the same column (and in adjacent rows). The odd-mode-shorted coupler may include a trans- mission line arrangement electrically connected between the two adjacent -gm cells in the same column (and in adjacent rows), a first capacitive arrangement electrically connected between the transmission line arrangement and one of the two adjacent -gm cells and operable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode impedance, and a second capacitive arrange- ment electrically connected between the transmission line arrangement and another one of the two adjacent -gm cells and operable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode imped- ance. In this embodiment, the odd-mode-shorted coupler includes a coupling transmission line electrically connecting two adjacent -gm cells in the same column (and in adjacent rows), one capacitor Ci connected between one of the -gm cells and the coupling transmission line, and another capaci- tor Ci connected between the other", "type": "Document"}}
