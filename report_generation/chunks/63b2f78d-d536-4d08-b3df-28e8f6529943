In this embodiment, the AC short termi- nation arrangement includes a grounded capacitor electri- cally connected in series with the transmission line arrange- ment. In this embodiment, the transmission line arrangement includes two straight transmission line portions arranged generally perpendicularly, a first one with an end electrically connected in series with the AC short termination arrange- ment, and a second one extending from the first and elec- trically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. A DC supply voltage may be applied at a node between the first transmission line portion and the AC short termination arrangement.", "type": "Document"}}
