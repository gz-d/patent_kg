In the following description, like numerals to those already employed to describe the typical switched type voltage regulator of FIG. 1 will be used to denote like parts, but preceded by the numeral \u20182\u2019.\n\ncurrent regulator FIG. to 2 in that it comprises a power source v, 212, a power conver- sion stage (PCS) 214, a controller stage 216, a compensator circuit 222 and a passive output component at the output of the current regulator 210. However, the passive component in this example comprises an inductor L 226. The inductor 226 is positioned at the output of the current regulator 210. The inductor 226 is arranged in series with a load impedance *Z,\u201d 220 of the current regulator and with a current source 228 of the compensator circuit 222 connecting its output. The cur- rent source 228 of the compensator circuit 222 is arranged in parallel with the load impedance 220. The inductor 226 serves as a current source to the output load impedance 220. It is used in the illustrated arrangement to help keep the current regulator\u2019s output current generally constant over time, although an output ripple will usually still be present in the output current signal in the absence of any application of\n\nIn the absence of any application of a compensation signal Vcomp from the compensator circuit 122, the voltage regulator 110 of FIG. 2 will have an output voltage signal v,, that generally tracks the constant level of the reference voltage signal v,.. However, due to the operation of the capacitor and/or other circuit effects, a ripple voltage signal is often present in the output voltage signal v,. as illustrated in FIG. 3b. The presence of the ripple voltage signal is undesirable.", "type": "Document"}}
