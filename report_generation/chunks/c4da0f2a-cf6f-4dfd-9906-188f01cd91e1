It would be appreciated that the modulation may be resulted from changes of the neuronal activities such as, but not limited to, an increase in interspike interval and a decrease in neuronal firing after deep brain stimulation. Suitable devices and methods can be used to determine the modulating effect of the deep brain stimulation of the present invention.\n\n[0050] FIG. 8 is a plot of stride length of the control group the DKO group before and after DCN stimulation, determined under the walking track test.\n\n[0051] FIG. 9 is a plot of retention time of the control group and the DKO group before and after DCN stimulation, determined in the rotarod test.\n\n[0052] FIG. 10 is a plot of transverse time of the control group and the DKO group before and after DCN stimulation, determined in the narrow beam walking test.\n\nwill\n\na\n\nthe had\n\na\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nwith\n\ntime\n\nof\n\nand\n\nby\n\none\n\nare\n\nthe\n\na\n\na\n\nDec. 31 , 2020\n\nUS 2020/0406031 A1\n\n3\n\nprocessor 108 is attached on the subject .
