The fabrication of the reactive functional groups can be performed through a pressurized hydrothermal treatment or another PIII&D process. The antimicrobial peptides will then aggregate on the outermost layer of the titanium substrate to form an antimicrobial peptide coating. [0011] The subject titanium alloy modified by PIII&D treatment has the ability to resist bacterial adhesion and growth, and its modified surface is also compatible with mammalian cells. [0012] The release of antimicrobial peptides from the outermost layer is only triggered when bacteria start to attach to the titanium surface, and is thus self-controlla- ble. In contrast, for conventional antibiotic or antimicro- bial peptide coatings, the conventional release mecha- nism of the antibacterial peptide or antibiotics loaded sur- faces is subject to the exposure to the body fluids and therefore uncontrollable. [0013] The present invention can be applied to ortho- paedic implants, but embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, the present invention can be applied to all implantable biomaterials such as cardiovascular im- plants and dental implants.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0014] The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.
