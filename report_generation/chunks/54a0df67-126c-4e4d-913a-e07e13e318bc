That is, the word does not preclude additional or unrecited elements, substances or method steps, in addition to those specifically recited. Thus, the described apparatus, substance or method may have other elements, substances or steps in various embodiments. The term \u201ccomprising\u201d (and its grammatical variations) as used herein are used in the inclusive sense of \u201chaving\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d and not in the sense of \u201cconsisting only of\u201d.\n\n[0098] attaching the p type semiconductor element to portion of the n type semiconductor element to define sensing junction,\n\n[0099] wherein the thermoelectric sensor is configured to detect heat at the sensing junction and generate an electric current and voltage in response to the detected heat.\n\n[0100] In one configuration the p type semiconductor element comprises Tin Telluride (SnTe) or Bismuth Anti- mony Telluride (Bio sSb, ;Te;) , and the n type semicon- ductor element comprises Lead Telluride (PbTe) or Bismuth Telluride(Bi,Te,).", "type": "Document"}}
