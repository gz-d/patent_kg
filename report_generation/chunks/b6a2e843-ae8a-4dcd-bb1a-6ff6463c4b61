The middle portion MP1 of the top insulating layer 112c, the middle portion MP2 of the intermediate insulating layer 1125, and the middle portion MP3 of the bottom insulating layer 112c protrude upwardly to collectively form an annular portion of the ring body 112. The middle portions MP1, MP2, MP3 are concentrically disposed with each other and share the same center C of circle.\n\nThe two side portions SP1 of the top insulating layer 112a extends toward two opposite sides of the ring body 112, respectively. The two side portions SP1 of the top insulating layer 112a make contact with the two side portions SP2 of the insulating layer 1126, respectively. The two side portions SP2 of the intermediate insulating layer 1124 extends toward two opposite sides of the ring body 112, respectively. The two side portions SP2 of the intermediate insulating layer 1124 make contact with the two side portions SP3 of the bottom insulating layer 112c, respectively.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION:\n\nIn the following description, an interactive wearable device, and machine learning based training methods of training the interactive wearable device and the likes are set forth as preferred examples. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications, including additions and/or substitutions may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Specific details may be omitted so as not to obscure the invention; however, the\n\n60\n\n65\n\nThe exemplary materials of the insulating layers 112a, 1124, 112c may include insulating materials, such as poly- vinyl chloride (PVC), and the present invention is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, the insulating layers 112a, 1124, 112c are fabricated using a stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer, and the present invention is not limited thereto.", "type": "Document"}}
