Such correction systems can reduce spinal\n\nVarious correction systems have been used to correct spinal\n\ndeformity by only 60% to 70%, but a full correction is almost\n\ndeformities. For example, the Harrington system, introduced\n\nimpossible. The use of excessive correction forces in attempt\n\nin the early 1950s, employs a distraction rod on the concave\n\nside of the deformed spine. The use of the Harrington system\n\ning a full correction can cause bony fractures or neurological\n\ndeficit due to spinal cord damage.\n\nand spinal fusion in treating idiopathic Scoliosis was found\n\nMoreover, none of the conventional correction systems\n\nuseful for both single and double thoracic contours.
