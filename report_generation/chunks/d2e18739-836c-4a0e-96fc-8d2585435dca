Every thirty minutes the bacteria solution was mixed by vortex an 100 wL aliquots of the bacteria samples were removed, anc used for serial dilution on agar plates. The appropriate numbers of colonies formed were counted and the tota amount of bacteria in the solution was calculated. The experiment was performed independently three times.\n\n[0145] FIG. 9 is a table showing properties of samples of the composition with different amounts of hydrophobic material, i.e. UPi-Co, UP,-C,, UP,-C;. The mechanical properties of the composition samples studied include maxi- mum stress, maximum strain, Young\u2019s modulus-tensile test, storage modulus G'-0.1 rad/s, Young\u2019s modulus-indentation, and glass transition temperature (T,).\n\n[0156] FIG. 8A illustrates time-dependent antimicrobia: activity of sample UP, -Cs and UP,-C, towards S. aureus by analysis of reduction of colony forming units (CFU). FIG. 8B illustrates time-dependent antimicrobial activity o: sample UP,-C, and UP,-C; towards E. coli by analysis o: reduction of CFU. The results illustrated that UP,-C, and UP,-Cs were able to reduce S. aureus and FE. coli colony forming units by more than 5 orders of magnitude after 90 min, corresponding to more than 99.999% reducing effi- ciency.\n\n[0146] FIG. 10 is a scatter diagram showing the frequency sweep in rheology measurement for monomeric units assembled in thymol oil. Over the entire range of frequen- cies storage modulus (GO is higher than loss modulus (G\"), illustrating solid-like properties. FIG. 10 also advanta- geously shows thymol oil as an effective hydrophobic mate- rial for encapsulation in the one or more monomeric units.", "type": "Document"}}
