For example, the hierarchical HMM with two layers contains a high-level HMM and several low-level HMMs. Each low-level HMM acts like a \u201cswitch\u201d that captures the transitions between cognitive states. It does so by learning the transitions between the low-level HMMs. This method of the instant invention is called a Switching HMM (SHMM). The SHMM the invention is used to capture the dynamics in cognitive state and eye movement pattern following an existing EMHMM approach and training one SHMM per participant summarize the participant\u2019s eye movement behavior during a task. The individual SHMMs are then clustered according to their similarities to detect common eye movement patterns task and examine the different movement patterns associated with different decision-\n\nthe\n\nIn\n\nof\n\nto\n\nin\n\nthe\n\neye\n\nmaking behaviors.\n\nApplying the novel EMSHMM of the instant invention, eye movement data were", "type": "Document"}}
