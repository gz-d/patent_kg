In one embodiment, the correction device 1 can comprise a sup- port member 10 of various forms. In an exemplary em- bodiment, the support member 10 can comprise a sup- porting rod 12 of various shapes. For example, the sup- porting rod 12 can have a general curved shape, such as a \"C\" or \"S\" shape, or other shapes depending on the sagittal profile of the spine. In another exemplary embod- iment, the support member 10 can be contoured to con- form to the natural spine curvature(s). For example, the support member 10 can be contoured to assume the nor- mal degree of spine kyphosis and/or lordosis. In an ex- emplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 1b, the sup- port member 10 can comprise a curved portion 14, which can be formed such as by bending the support member 10 to conform to a deformed spine portion 4 to be cor- rected. [0037] The support member 10 can be placed in vari- ous positions in relation to the spine 2. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be positioned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. In another exem- plary embodiment, the curved support member 10 can be positioned on the posterior side of the vertebrae and", "type": "Document"}}
