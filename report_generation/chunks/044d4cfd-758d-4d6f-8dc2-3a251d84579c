Consistently, the RIP-gPCR results shows that XIST IncRNA is significantly correlated with SNF2L (FIG. 2g). SNF2L and SNF2H are two collateral ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes belonging to the ISWI (Imitation Switch) family, which can move nucleosomes along DNA. For more than ten years, IWSI has been known to be associated with cohesin complexes in human cells. Consistent with this, the present invention identified two cohesin subunits SMC1A and RAD21 that interact with XIST (FIG. 1c).\n\n[0110]\n\nIn order to verify the role of these two new RBPs", "type": "Document"}}
