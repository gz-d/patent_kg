The antenna can also be selectively excited to operate as a dielectric resonator antenna alone or as a Fabry-Perot resonator antenna alone, and can be simultane- ously excited to operate as both a dielectric resonator antenna and a Fabry-Perot resonator antenna\n\n[0017] Preferably, the antenna further includes a ground on which the dielectric block is arranged.\n\n[0018] In accordance with a second aspect of the inven- tion, there is provided communication device comprising an antenna of the first aspect. The communication device may include multiple such antennas. The communication device may be operable for 4G and 5G (and subsequent generation) communications. The communication device may be a mobile phone, a computer, a tablet computer, a watch, an\n\n[0008] Preferably, the dielectric block is substantially solid, and may have a generally rectangular form.\n\na\n\nare\n\nby\n\na\n\ncular.\n\na\n\ntor\n\nplane\n\nMar. 4. 2021\n\nUS 2021/0066789 Al\n\n2\n\n[ 0034 ] FIG . 11 is a graph showing the measured total\n\nIoT device , or any information handle system .
