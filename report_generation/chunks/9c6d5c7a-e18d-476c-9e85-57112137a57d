The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated protein (Cas) system enables efficient DNA modification guided by a complementary RNA and in the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). However, non-perfect guide-RNA- target-DNA matching has been known to occur which can result in modifications at genomic loci other than the intended locus. This off-target activity can limit the broad application of this technology. Accordingly, modified pro- teins for altering the genome of a cell with application in editing and therapy are desired.\n\nIn an embodiment, the modified protein comprising sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 homologue thereof further comprises one or more muta- tions at R245, N419 and/or R654 positions.\n\nin an embodiment, the mod mutations at R245, N419 and modified protein comprises defined in SEQ ID NO: 3 or lified protein further comprises R654 positions, preferably the an amino acid sequence as a homologue thereof.\n\nin an embodiment, the mod mutations at R245, N419 an modified protein comprises ified protein further comprises R654 positions, preferably the an amino acid sequence defined in SEQ ID NO: 4 or a homologue thereof.\n\nin an embodiment, the mutation is a single amino substitution.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nin an embodiment, the modified protein comprises alanine the N413 position. In a further embodiment, the modified protein comprises alanine at the N413, R245, N419 and/or R654 positions.\n\nIna first aspect, the invention provides a modified protein. Preferably, the modified protein is a Streptococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) protein with a mutation at an N413 position, and optionally one or more of a nuclear localization sequence, a cell penetrating peptide sequence, an affinity tag and/or a fusion base editor protein.", "type": "Document"}}
