In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area 108 (shaded in Fig.1b). Therefore, this cross-sectional area inust be large enough so that enough flux and energy can be picked up by the second- ary device. It should be noted that this secondary device must be housed inside the electronic equipment to be charged on the charging platform. The thickness of the secondary device is crucial to the applicability and prac- ticality of the device. If it is too thick, it simply cannot be housed in the electronic equipment.
