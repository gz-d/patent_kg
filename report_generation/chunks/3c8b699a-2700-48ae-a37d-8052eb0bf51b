FIG. 5A shows how the wound is induced and the present device is implanted in the rats. An injury (5 mm in length, 2 mm in depth) is created. on the biceps femoris muscle of the two hind limbs on rats. To apply the electrostimulation on the injury, the microneedle patches of the present device are inserted into the two sides of the wound, and the antenna is placed above the gluteus superficialis muscle.
