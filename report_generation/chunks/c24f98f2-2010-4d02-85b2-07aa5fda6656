In order to achieve compression yielding in the plastic hinge 20, the concrete 15 on both sides of the compression yielding zone should be stronger than that of the compression yielding zone. On the other hand, tension yielding of reinforcement should be avoided in order to avoid. breaking of the non-ductile bars 18a. As a result, the plastic deformation takes place on the compression side and is con- fined inside the compression yielding zone. Hence the plastic hinge length 55 is simply the length of the compression yield- ing zone. This makes the determination of the plastic hinge length 55 much simpler than that for conventional reinforced. concrete (RC) members.\n\nL/2 = ae f (f std oo pf2 12 Lp!
