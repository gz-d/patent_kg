However, if the electromagnetic flux is large, a fairly thick layer of soft- magnetic material is needed, defeating the purpose of design- ing a \u201cthin\u201d charging platform and increasing the cost due to the large amount of soft magnetic material required. In addi- tion, the electromagnetic shielding effect of using one layer of soft magnetic material may not be sufficient for electromag- netic compatibility (EMC) requirements. Some flux may still penetrate through the soft magnetic layer and induce current in any conductive surface below the charging platform.\n\nELECTRONIC CONTROL METHOD FOR A PLANAR INDUCTIVE BATTERY CHARGING APPARATUS\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThis invention relates to methods and apparatus for the control of a planar battery charging apparatus.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe increasing popularity of portable consumer electronic products such as mobile phones, MP3 players and PDAs has prompted new concerns on the huge variety and number of battery chargers that are required and which are costly, incon- venient and eventually lead to electronic waste problems. Inductive or wireless charging apparatus that can charge more than one electronic product have been proposed. Two differ- ent approaches to the generation of AC magnetic flux have been proposed, namely \u201chorizontal flux\u201d and \u201cvertical flux\u201d methods.", "type": "Document"}}
