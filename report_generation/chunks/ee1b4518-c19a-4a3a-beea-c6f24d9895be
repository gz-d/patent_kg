Meanwhile, because of the stronger EDL effect relative to the electrostatic interaction between PTFE and ITO, these positive charges initially bound by ITO can be teleased and flow toward the drain electrode (iv). When the water droplet starts to retract (v) until its separation with the drain electrode (vi), the charges on the drain electrode can flow back to ITO, transiting to the switching-off mode again.\n\nvidual TIDE-G device lights up 100 commercial see right portion of figure).\n\n[0026] FIG. 26 is a graph illustrating that under the same conditions such as the size and release height of continuous impinging of individual droplets, the voltage output mea- sured from TIDE-G (in red) is over two orders of magnitude higher than that on the control TENG device. The negligible electricity generation from triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is limited by the interfacial effect, though its PTFE surface is loaded with sufficient charges as in the case o TIDE-G. The frequency of impinging droplets is set at 4.2 Hz.\n\n[0035] FIG. 46 illustrates a MD simulation showing distribution of charges inside the water and on the PTFE surface for the switching-off mode.", "type": "Document"}}
