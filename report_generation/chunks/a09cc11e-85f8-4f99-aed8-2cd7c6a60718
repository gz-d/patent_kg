Thus, to facilitate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of diodes in a bridge rectifier, there can be at least one current-controlled switch in each current path of the circuitry associated with the synchronous rectifier (e.g., the equivalent diode-bridge circuit). In an embodiment, one or more of the switches can be metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) (e.g., power MOSFETs), which each can have inherent body diodes.\n\nconsumes a relatively low amount of power, and can receive portion of the AC voltage source or preferably at least a portion of the rectified signal generated by the multi-phase synchronous rectifier to facilitate powering the SDGD sub- system. In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem, or at least desired portion, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can be employed to facilitate controlling respective switching of the power switches. In another aspect, the SDGD subsystem and associated power switches can be divided into two parts, which can include a high-side portion that includes three (or more) of the switches (e.g., VCSD power switches) and a high-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, and a low-side portion that includes the other three (or more) switches (e.g., CCSD power switches) and a low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, wherein the high-side portion and low-side portion of the system can be symmetrical.", "type": "Document"}}
