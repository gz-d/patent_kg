A battery pack (700, 900, 1600) for an electronic de- vice comprising: battery cells (704, 1602), a battery charging circuit, an energy receiving element (1, 2, 1302, 1604, 1606) adapted to receive power from a planar inductive charging system, said energy re- ceiving element having an inductance (Lr), and a di- ode rectifier (1308) and a DC capacitor (Cdc) con- nected to the energy receiving element to provide a rectified dc voltage that can be fed from the energy receiving element to said battery charging circuit, characterized in that a second capacitor (1306, Cr)\n\n6\n\n11\n\nEP 1 908 159 B1\n\n12\n\nis connected to said energy receiving element and forms a resonant tank therewith, and in that said energy receiving element comprises a generally pla- nar thin soft magnetic sheet (2, 1204, 1604) and a first coil (1, 1207, 1606) wound around the edge of said magnetic sheet (2, 1204, 1604) such that the coil (1, 1207, 1606) lies in a plane defined by said magnetic sheet (2, 1204, 1604).\n\n2. A battery pack as claimed in claim 1 wherein said second capacitor (1306, Cr) is connected in series with said first coil (1302) and forms said resonant tank with said first coil (1, 1207, 1606) and said mag- netic sheet (2, 1204, 1604).\n\n5\n\n10\n\ntifier and a DC capacitor (Cdc) to provide a rectified DC voltage that can be fed from the energy receiving element to a battery charging circuit of said battery pack.\n\n11. An energy receiving element as claimed in claim 10 further comprising a second coil (1200) formed as a spiral in a plane parallel to said soft magnetic sheet (1204) and wherein said second coil (1200) is con- nected in parallel with said first coil (1207).\n\n12. An energy receiving element as claimed in claim 11 wherein said second coil (1200) is formed on a print- ed circuit board (1202).\n\n15", "type": "Document"}}
