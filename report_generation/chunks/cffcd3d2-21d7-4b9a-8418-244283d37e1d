First, Vo is disconnected from pin 1 to create Node A and Node D. Second, the filter capacitor C 118 is disconnected from the ground of the regulator to create Node B and Node C. Finally, Node Eis the voltage reference Vref of the controller. Node C is the actually the common ground of the voltage regulator and compensator circuit.", "type": "Document"}}
