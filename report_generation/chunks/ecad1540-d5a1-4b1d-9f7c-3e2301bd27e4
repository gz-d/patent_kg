The control signal is arranged to control the deflector based on A and B. These predeter- mined equations can be referred to as the first set of equations.\n\n[0037] The method 200 then proceeds to step 204, to process the determined first scanning direction and the determined second scanning direction based on predeter- mined equations. The predetermined equations may be the first and/or the second set illustrated in the description relating to FIG. 1. In one example, in step 204, processing the determined first scanning direction and the determined second scanning direction may include comparing the first scanning direction with a first reference direction, and comparing the second scanning direction with a second reference direction (the first reference direction and the second reference direction are substantially orthogonal).\n\n[0033] Alternatively, or additionally, the predetermined may include\n\n[0038] Subsequently, the method 200 proceeds to step 206, to provide, based on the processing, a control signal to the deflector to adjust one or both of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction such that they are within a required (predetermined) orthogonality limit. The two scanning directions are considered to be substan- tially orthogonal when the angle between the first and second scanning directions are between 85 degrees to 95 degrees, preferably between 89 degrees to 91 degrees, more preferably about 90 degrees.\n\nA=A'Bsin \u4e2d\n\nB-B\u2019", "type": "Document"}}
