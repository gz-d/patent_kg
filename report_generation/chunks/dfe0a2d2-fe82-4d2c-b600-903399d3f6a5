No. 7,164, 255, GB2389767A, WO2007/019806) creates an ac mag- netic field with the flux lines 4 flowing substantially vertically out ofa planar charging surface 5 (FIG. 2(a)). Since the lines of flux leave the charging surface vertically, the entire surface of the load in principle can be used to pick up the flux [S. C. Tang, S. Y.R. Hui and H. Chung, \u201cEvaluation of the Shielding Effects on Printed-Circuit-Board Transformers using Ferrite Plates and Copper Sheets,\u201d JEEE Transactions on Power\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided, in a first aspect, a planar battery charging system comprising a primary power transmission side formed of an array of pri- mary windings adapted to generate magnetic flux substan- tially perpendicular to a charging surface, and a secondary power receiving side comprising a secondary winding asso- ciated with a battery to be charged and being adapted to receive the magnetic flux when placed on the charging sur- face, the secondary winding being provided with electromag-\n\nSYSTEM\n\nelectronic load at a time.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65", "type": "Document"}}
