The p type semiconductor element and n type semiconductor element are appropriately doped to create a p type and n type semiconductor element. In the p type semiconductor ele- ment the primary charge carriers are holes i.e. a movement of positive charges. In the n type semiconductor element the primary charge carriers are electrons ie. movement of electrons. The charges e.g. electrons move from the hot portion to the cold portion of the semiconductor elements i.e. away from the heat source or along the descending temperature gradient. There is a charge build up in the semiconductor elements at one end. The conductor member which may be a metal e.g. copper or gold or aluminium\n\n[0129] FIG. 9 illustrates a method of forming a thermo- electric device of FIG. 7.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION", "type": "Document"}}
