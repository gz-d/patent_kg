For a spiral winding, the number of tums is highest in the centre of the spiral winding and lowest in the edge of the spiral winding. This means that the magnitude of the magnetic field is highest in the centre and decreases from the centre, Fig.1(s) showa a typical single spiral winding. If excited with an ac power source at high frequency (say over 10kHz), an ac magnetic flux is generated. Fig.1(b) shows the measured magnitude plot of the magnetic field distribution of the single spiral winding in Fig.1(a). It can be seen that the magnitude of the magnetic field is highest in the centre of the spiral winding and this magnitude decreases with\n\nincreasing distance from the centre.\n\nIf the secondary element is not placed in the central area of the inductive surface, the magnetic flux it experiences is small and therefore the current induced in it is also small. Consequently, the heating effect is far from satisfactory. This non-uniform magnetic field distribution and its associated non-uniform heating problem limit the performance of many commercial induction heating systems.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided apparatus for the transfer of energy by electrical induction comprising a primary induction unit formed with a planar surface for receiving at Jeast one secondary element to which energy is to be transferred, wherein said primary induction unit comprises an array of primary transformer windings so as to provide a substantially uniform magnetic flux distribution over said planar surface.", "type": "Document"}}
