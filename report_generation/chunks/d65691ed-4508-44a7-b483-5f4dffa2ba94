Furthermore, while other metal complexes (e.g., Ru, Ir, and Rh) which may also exhibit photooxidation ability at their highest oxidation state, it has been found that platinum(IV) complexes containing two axial ligands are easily functionalized. Consequently, during the photoreduc- tion of the platinum(IV) complexes herein, the two axial ligands will typically be released, making the platinum(IV) complexes more flexible to design with multifunctional prodrugs. Accordingly, in an embodiment herein, the releas- able ligand may itself possess anti-cancer and/or drug activ- ity.", "type": "Document"}}
