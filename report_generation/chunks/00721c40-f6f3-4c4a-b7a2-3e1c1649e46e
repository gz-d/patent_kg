The power supply component 420 can comprise a battery compo- nent 422 that can include one or more batteries (e.g., re- chargeable or replaceable batteries). The power supply com- ponent 420 can provide power to various components of the barrier control component 400, barrier component, and/or projector screen component. The power supply component 420 can be electrically and/or communicatively connected to the sensor component 406, and can receive power generated by the cell component 408, and can store that power in the 422.\n\nprocessor component 424 that can work in conjunction with the other components (e.g., communicator component 402, interface component 404, sensor component 406, etc.) to facilitate performing the various functions of the barrier con- trol component 400. The processor component 424 can employ one or more processors, microprocessors, or control- lers that can process data, such as detected signals (e.g., optical signals or patterns) relating to visual images being presented by the projector screen component, mapping infor- mation relating the detected signals and control signals, data relating to parameters associated with the barrier contro component 400 and associated components, etc., to facilitate identifying a desired control signal to transmit to the barrier component in response to a detected signal. The processor component 424 also can control data flow between the barrier control component 400 and other components associated", "type": "Document"}}
