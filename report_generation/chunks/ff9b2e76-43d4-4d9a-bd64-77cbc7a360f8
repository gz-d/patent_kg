The reason for this may be the voltage drop in the bonding wires, as the DC current can be as high as 2.6 A. In this example the supply voltage V, is measured on the printed circuit board (PCB), and the voltage drop in the bonding wires will lead to a smaller voltage applied to the transistor. Apart from inaccuracy of the model, the voltage drop issue may also account for the difference between simulation and measurement in EIRP.\n\nIn this embodiment, tuning the bias voltage of the\n\n[0205]\n\nperipheral subarrays (V, or V4) can effectively change the stable phase relationship, as verified by the simulated phase in FIG. 24A, in which V,, is set at 0.8V and the remaining subarrays are kept at 1V. Thus, the radiation beam in the H-plane can be steered. V,,, and Yes are slightly adjusted in the measurement, and the measured radiation patterns and. corresponding bias configuration are shown in FIGS. 24B and 24C. It is found that in this example the radiation beam in the H plane can be scanned from -45\u00b0 to +450 (5 dB\n\ndegradation).\n\n[0206]\n\nSome of the above embodiments of the invention", "type": "Document"}}
