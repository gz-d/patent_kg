In particular, the present invention relates to the production of nanodrug using an ice template.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0003] Nanodrugs are of great importance in the biomedi- cal field due to several offered merits such as enhanced water dispersibility, bioavailability and improved tumour passive targeting ability.\n\n[0004] Nanodrugs are particles of a drug which are so small that they are measured in the range of nanometres, typically in tens of nanometres. Due to their small size, nanodrugs can be finely dispersed in solvents in which the drugs are not naturally soluble. This provides a new mode of delivery and opens up the possibility of new and exciting properties that were not seen typically in the same drugs.", "type": "Document"}}
