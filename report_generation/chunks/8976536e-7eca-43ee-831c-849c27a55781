In a particular embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 3 or a homologue thereof that includes a mutation at N413, N419, R245 and R654 positions. In a preferred embodiment, the mutation is a single amino acid substitution. In another preferred embodiment, the modified protein includes an alanine at the N413 position, and/or optionally at the N419, R245 and R654 positions.\n\nThe term \u201chomologue\u201d used herein refers to amino acids having a sequence identity of at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or at least 95% to the modified protein according to the present invention. In an embodiment, the homologue of the modified protein has at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% overall sequence identity to the modified protein. In a particular embodiment, the modified protein consists of a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4 or a homologue thereof.\n\nIn some embodiments, the modified protein with a muta- tion at an N413 position further includes three E782K, N968K and R1015H mutations. In a particular embodiment, the modified protein includes an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 2 or a homologue thereof.", "type": "Document"}}
