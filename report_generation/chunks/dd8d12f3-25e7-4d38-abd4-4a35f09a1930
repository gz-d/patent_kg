It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifica- tions and variations will be apparent to the practitioner skilled in the art.\n\nis\n\nUS 2024/0143524 Al\n\n[0137] The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments and with various modifications that are suited to the particular use contemplated.\n\nWhat is claimed is:\n\n1. A processor for a cryptosystem, comprising:\n\na\n\nhybrid processor architecture including a hardware processor, a software processor and an interconnection interface arranged to exchange data between the hard- ware processor and the software processor;\n\nwherein the hardware processor comprises a plurality of hardware accelerator modules arranged to perform computational tasks including at least one of number theoretic transforms (NIT) computation, arithmetic operations which are more time-consuming when being performed instead by the software-processor.\n\n2. The processor of claim 1, wherein the interconnection interface includes a high-performance interface and a gen- eral-purpose low performance interface arranged to exchange difference types of data between the hardware processor and the software processor.\n\n3. The processor of claim 2, wherein the interconnection interface includes an AXI memory interconnect and an AXI lite peripheral interconnect operable as the high-perfor- mance interface and the general-purpose low performance interface respectively.", "type": "Document"}}
