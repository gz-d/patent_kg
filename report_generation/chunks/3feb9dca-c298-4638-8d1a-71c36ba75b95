On a signal processing level, this could be accomplished, for example by enhancing the main melody of the music, enhancing the percussive elements (drums, etc.), using source separation algorithms to enhancing only the vocal or only the bass, reducing the complexity of the music through filtering (e.g., frequency filtering), removing the source music entirely and leaving only the enhanced elements, etc. Some of these signal processing techniques may be based on those dis- closed in Cappotto, D., Xuan, W., Meng, Q., Zhang, C., and Schnupp, J.
