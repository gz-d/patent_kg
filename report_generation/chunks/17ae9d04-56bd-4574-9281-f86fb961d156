The substrate integrated waveguide 404 is operable to receive and guide an in-plane electromagnetic wave (guided wave). The metasurface structure 402 is arranged to extract and modulate the in- plane electromagnetic wave, and radiate an out-of-plane modulated electromagnetic wave (propagating wave). In this embodiment, the metasurface structure 402 is integrated with the substrate integrated waveguide 404.\n\n[0133] In this embodiment, as best shown in FIG. 4B, the substrate integrated waveguide 404 includes a dielectric substrate, an upper electrically conductive layer arranged on top of the dielectric substrate, a lower electrically conductive layer embedded in the dielectric substrate, and multiple parallel rows of metallic via holes arranged in the dielectric substrate and electrically connecting the two electrically conductive layers.\n\n[0134]\n\nIn this embodiment, the metasurface structure 402", "type": "Document"}}
