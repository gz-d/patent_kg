The full coin cell 20\" may be constructed in a similar manner as the device 20' expect that the cathode is cathode 36, i.e., the cathode having the COF as mentioned. herein; and the anode is a presodiated anode 32\". The term \u201cpresodiated anode\u201d generally denotes that the anode is configured to have an excessive amount of sodium ions by way of a presodiation process as compared with the one without subjecting to the presodiation process. It is believed that by enhancing the sodium ion content of the anode, it may reduce/minimize the consumption of sodium ion from the lattice structure of the anode and/or from the electrolyte during cycling operation, thus enhancing the integrity of the anode and/or the stability of the electrolyte during operation, and therefore enhancing the overall electrochemical perfor- mance of the battery. Preferably, the presodiated anode, as compared with the anode without presodiation, may have an excessive/additional amount of sodium ion of at least about 70%, at least 80%, at least about 90%, from about 90% to about 100%, from about 92% to about 100%, from about 95% to about 99%, from about 95% to about 100%, from\n\nabout 98% to about 100%, or about 100%.", "type": "Document"}}
