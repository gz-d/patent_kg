The polymer derived from e-caprolactone (e-CL) alone forms a biodegradable polymeric material referred to as polycapro- lactone (PCL). Other biodegradable polymers can be formed by the copolymerization process using other lactone mono- mers such as y-butyrolactone (y-BL), 6-valerolactone (8-VL), y-valerolactone (y-VL), and y-caprolactone (y-CL). The biodegradable polymer can be a polymer or copolymer of any of these monomers or any combination thereof. The formation process of the polymer can be either with or without catalysts. In an alternative embodiment, instead of chemically synthesizing the polymer from monomers, the\n\nWith the hybrid materials of the subject invention, the mechanical properties of the materials can be modified so as\n\nThe present invention pertains to novel hybrid materials\n\nplastic in consumer goods.\n\nmetallic\n\nhave\n\nrods, tubes, or any combination thereof.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n65\n\nto\n\nThe novel\n\nmaterials\n\nbe formed\n\na biodegradable xylitol-based polymer.\n\nIn an embodiment of the\n\ninvention, the biode-\n\npolymer may be obtained by purchasing a commercially\n\nUS 10,603,412 B2\n\n5\n\n6\n\navailable sample .
