The powder sample was spread in a thin and uniform layer between Kapton tapes (McMaster-Carr), which needs to be homoge- neous and free from pinholes. All the soft and hard XAS data was processed using IFEFFIT program.\n\nSTEM-EELS Characterization\n\n[0038] The STEM-HAADF images and STEM-EELS spectra were performed on an aberration-corrected micro- scope (JEM-ARM 200F, JEOL) operating at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dropping ethanol dispersion of particles onto a carbon-coated copper grid. The STEM imaging conditions were optimized for EELS with a probe size of 0.8 A, a convergence semi-angle of 28.5 mrad, and the collection semi-angle of 88 mrad. The EELS spectra were collected with energy dispersion of 0.25 eV per chan- nel and an energy resolution about 1 eV.\n\nCollection and Analysis of X-Ray PDF\n\n[0039] The PDF was extracted from high energy synchro- tron X-ray total scattering by direct Fourier transform of reduced structure function (F(Q), up to Q=24.7 A) using 11-ID-C beamline at APS of ANL (X-ray wavelength 0.1173 A). The NCM811 powders were loaded into a 2 mm capillary with data acquisition time of 15 minutes for each sample. The background scattering from the empty capillary was extracted. G(r) functions, G(r)=4ar[p(r)-p,], where p(r) and p, are the local and average atomic number densities, were computed with PDFgetX3 software. The PDF refine- ments were carried out using PDF gui software package. The structural models were defined in hexagonal (R-3m) unit cell for the pristine NCM811, and monoclinic (C2/m) unit cell for the PGE-NCM811 sample. The parameters, including lattice constants, atomic positions and anisotropic thermal ellipsoids, are allowed to vary using a least squares approach until a best-fit of the PDF was obtained.\n\nComputational Methods", "type": "Document"}}
