Each of the plurality of biasing circuit portions is respectively operably coupled with a respective one the plurality of subwavelength units of the metasurface structure. The biasing circuit portions may bias the first and second semiconductor elements of the first control arrangement in the same bias state. The biasing circuit portions may bias the first and second semiconductor elements of the second control arrangement in the same bias state.\n\n[0036] In some embodiments, the waveguide is operable to guide the electromagnetic wave, and the metasurface structure is operable to radiate the modulated electromag- netic wave away from the waveguide into free space.\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\n[0037] In some embodiments, the waveguide is generally\n\nplanar.\n\n\u00b0\n\n[0038] In some embodiments, the electromagnetic wave comprises an in-plane wave (e.g., in-plane guided wave), and the modulated electromagnetic wave comprises an out- -plane wave (e.g., out-of-plane propagating wave).\n\n[0039] In some embodiments, the first and second semi- conductor elements of the first control arrangements and the first and second semiconductor elements of the second control arrangements of the plurality of subwavelength units of the metasurface structure are arranged to be controlled by a controller to respectively selectively operate in ON state and OFF state, to operate each respective one of the plurality of subwavelength units accordingly (e.g., radiating state and. non-radiation state; first and second radiating states; etc.).", "type": "Document"}}
