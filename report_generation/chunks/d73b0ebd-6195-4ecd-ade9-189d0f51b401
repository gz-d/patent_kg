The chemical crosslink may include at least one covalent ond that is formed in different ways. In one example, the chemical crosslink may include at least one covalent bond formed at a bonding site 204 between the adjacent pair o polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202.\n\n[0153] The battery 100' may also include an encapsulating layer 112 located at the outer surface of the battery. The encapsulating layer may be a polymeric layer such as an elastomeric layer encapsulating the battery. The elastomeric layer may form at least one crosslinked structure with the electrolyte 106 such that the elastomeric layer is directly coated on surface of the hydrogel electrolyte 106. In this example, the elastomeric layer 112 may form at least one crosslinked structure, such as a chemical crosslinked struc- ture with the encapsulation 130, which has the same com- position as the electrolyte 106, thereby encapsulating the 100'.\n\n[0161] For example, the chemical crosslink may include a first crosslinking agent 206, such as methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA) crosslinker, which forms at least one kind o covalent bonds with each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202 or PAAm. Preferably, the crosslinking agent may act as an anchor for bonding the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material together so as to strengthen the robust- ness of the structure. That is, the second crosslinked struc- ture comprises a plurality of polymer chains of the secon polymeric material covalently bonded together via the first 206.", "type": "Document"}}
