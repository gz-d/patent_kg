These algorithmic descriptions and/or representations are the means employed by those cognizant in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others equally skilled. An algorithm is here, generally, conceived to be a self-con- sistent sequence of acts leading to a desired result. The acts are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quan- tities. Typically, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical and/or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and/or other- wise manipulated.\n\nDC output voltage is ready to power up the control circuitry (e.g., SDGD system) for the switches (e.g., MOSFETs), the body diodes of the switches, which are arranged in relation to each other to form the traditional diode bridge rectifier circuit, can provide the initial rectification function. During the initial start-up stage (prior to steady-state operation of the SDSR), the conduction loss can be equivalent to that of a power diode bridge, however, the start-up stage lasts for only a short period of time. Once the rectified DC output voltage is available to power the control circuitry for the switches, the normal syn- chronous rectification of the SDSR with the relatively low conduction loss (as compared to conventional rectifier bridges) can begin. It is noted that, for a single-phase SDSR, the diagonal pair of switches can be turned on and off together to form a conducting path. For instance, with regard briefly to FIG. 1, switches 102 and 108 can form one pair, and switches 104 and 106 can form the other pair. However, these two pairs respective pairs of switches can be turned on and off in a complementary manner. That is, when switch 102 and switch 108 are turned on, switch 104 and switch 106 are turned off,", "type": "Document"}}
