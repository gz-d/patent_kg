As shown in FIGS. 12A and 128, it is obvious that significant distri- bution difference can be found between two cell lines in both nuclear diameter and nuclear elasticity. For nuclear diameter distributions, NP460 cells centralize in the group ranging from 8 jum to 12 hm while NPC43 cells tend to distribute in\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\ngroup ranging from 12 hm to 14 um. If nuclear diameter value of 12 hm is taken as the nuclear size separating boundary, there will be 64.6% NPC43 cells in the \u2018larger\u2019 domain and 87.2% NP460 cells in the \u2018smaller\u2019 domain. When considering the nuclear elasticity, majority of mea- sured NPC43 cells have nuclear elasticities ranging from 2 kPa to 4 kPa, while a large number of measured NP460 cells have nuclear elasticity ranging from 4 kPa to 6 kPa. If nuclear elastic modulus value of 4 kPa is taken as the nuclear stiffness separating boundary, there will be 62.5% NPC43 cells in \u2018softer\u2019 domain and 78.7% NP460 cells in \u2018stiffer\u2019 domain.\n\nDevice Fabrication\n\nThe microfluidic device is fabricated mainly based\n\n[0130]", "type": "Document"}}
