This element is a component of the element 113 in FIG. 1. The processed structured data 307 is from the structured data pre-processing process 300, and the processed textual data 405 is from the textual data pre-processing process 400. Element 701 is a combination filter, which can screen out the samples that only have one of structured data and textual data. All the data passing through the filter element 701 are mixed data 703, where the structured data and textual data are filtered structured data 702 and filtered textual data 704, respectively. The filtered structured data needs to go through machine learning and deep learning pipelines. The data are first randomly divided into training set 705, validation set 706 and testing set 707. The training set 705 and the validation set 706 are used to train various machine learning and deep learning models, and then the testing set 707 is added for model verification 702, and finally trained machine learning and deep learning models are obtained and saved into element 715. As for the filtered textual data 704, the data is first divided into training set 708, validation set 709 and testing set 710. The training set 708 and the validation set 709 are used to train various machine learning and deep learning models, and then the testing set 714 is added for model verification 710, and finally trained deep learning models are obtained and saved into element 716. The input data of ensemble models 717 is mixed data 703. All the ensemble models have a structure of two or more layers, the first layer is the\n\ncombination of trained models from element 715 and 716, the ensemble methods\n\n30\n\ninclude, but are not limited to, various voting models and stacking models.\n\nDocket No. UM1104HK00\n\n14\n\nHK 30057394 A\n\n[0050]", "type": "Document"}}
