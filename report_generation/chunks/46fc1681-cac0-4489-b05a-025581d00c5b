Such delay period is closely relevant to the process time of the receiver. For example, the process time may include a sampling time period of an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver end, which also defines the symbol rate of the wireless signal receiver.\n\n[0055] In one example embodiment, a low-complexity precoder may be constructed with an analogue delay-line. Preferably, the precoder does not require high speed memory to store the blocking signal, nor an analogue-to-digital convertor (ADC) and memory module to operate at the same rate of the transmit symbol rate.\n\n[0056] Preferably, the sub-channel analogue signals may be sampled at rate P before feeding into the analogue delay-line with constant time delay At per adjacent sub- channel. In addition, the delay element may be provided in the output stage of the transmitter end, i.e. just before the signal is transmitted using the antenna(s) in the transmitter.\n\n[0048] Preferably, the modulated signal in each of the sub-channels will be passed to the antennas through the switches and the delay components in each of the individual channels. By introducing a delay component, between the switches and the antennas, the sub-channel signals reach the antenna and therefore are placed in a transmission queue according to the different delay periods placed in the output stage in each channel.", "type": "Document"}}
