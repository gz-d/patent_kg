The radiator 2700 includes multiple radiator units 2700-1, 2700-2, 2700-3 operably coupled with each other. While FIG. 27 only shows three radiator units 2700-1, 2700-2, 2700-3, it should be appreciated that the radiator 2700 can include any number of (at least one) radiator units.\n\n[0120] In some embodiments, each of the radiator units 2700-1, 2700-2, 2700-3 may be the radiator unit 2500 or the radiator unit 2600. Each of the radiator units 2700-1, 2700-2, 2700-3 respectively includes an oscillator arrangement 2702-1, 2702-2, 2702-3 operable to generate third harmonic power (e.g., in the form of electric current or voltage) and a patch antenna arrangement 2704-1, 2704-2, 2704-3 operably coupled with the corresponding oscillator arrangement 2702-1, 2702-2, 2702-3 for radiating terahertz electromag- netic radiation based on the third harmonic power generated\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nby the corresponding oscillator arrangement 2702-1, 2702- 2702-3. In some embodiments, the radiator units 2700-1, 2700-2, 2700-3 are operably coupled to operate coherently.\n\n2,\n\nthe\n\nradiator\n\n[0121] In some embodiments, 2700 may include multiple radiator units arranged in an array with one or more rows. In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 may include multiple radiator units arranged in an array with multiple rows each including at least one radiator unit, and. all of the oscillators of all the radiator units form multiple rows and multiple columns of oscillators. In some embodi- ments, the array (of multiple radiator units) can be divided into multiple subarrays each having multiple rows, and each subarray may be subjected to a respective bias voltage, which can be controlled to affect one or more properties (e.g., radiation pattern, direction, etc.) of the terahertz elec- tromagnetic radiation provided by the radiator 2700.", "type": "Document"}}
