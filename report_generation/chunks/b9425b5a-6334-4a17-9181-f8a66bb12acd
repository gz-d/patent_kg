As depicted in FIG. 46, in the case o switching-off state, negative and positive ions are randomly distributed in the bulk water layer and the amount of EDL formed at the water/PFFE is insignificant. In contrast, when the TIDE-G is in the switching-on mode, there is a prefer- ential separation in the positive and negative charges, thus avoiding the screening effect dominated in the switching-off state FIG. 4c. In this condition, the number of positive- negative charges at the water/PTFE interface is two orders of magnitude larger than its counterpart (FIG. 4d).\n\n[0072] Fundamentally, the electricity generation of our devices according to the present invention is governed by the bulk effect rather than the interfacial effect. The coop- eration between the virtual source, source, drain and the configurable gating droplet allows a reversible, efficient and sustainable conversion of the hydrodynamic energy, which is usually not utilized for power generation. The configur- able and soft nature of the impinging water droplets ensures high liquid/solid contact area, promoting the effective charge transfer, which is also in striking contrast to solid/ solid contact electrification which suffers from limited point contact. In addition to advantages such as enhanced perfor- mances, optical transparency and cost-effectiveness, the transistor-like design can also be constructed on flexible substrates. This design principle represents a potentially paradigm-shift solution to solving inherent power-density limitation imposed by the interfacial effect, and could open new pathways for the efficient harvesting abundant hydro- in the form of", "type": "Document"}}
