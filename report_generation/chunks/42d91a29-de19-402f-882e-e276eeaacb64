In accordance with one aspect, the stroke assessment system comprises a clinical data collection module, a mortality prediction module, an accurate stroke subtypes classification (ICD-9 prediction) module, a treatment decision module, and a\n\nLVO patient\u2019s classification module.\n\n20\n\n[0006] In accordance with various embodiments, the stroke assessment system uses structured data, image data, textual report data as input to each of the modules, through data pre-processing and data analysis steps, to complete the function of each of the module.\n\n25\n\n[0007] The mortality prediction module predicts the mortality of one or more stroke\n\npatients. The module receives structured data (including diagnosis information, biological test data, etc.) and textual data (including patient clinical reports, radiology test reports, etc.) of the stroke patients as the module's input, processes the structured data through one or more networks of multi-level machine learning model, deep learning model, and/or ensemble models thereof, then generates and outputs short-term\n\nor long-term probabilities of deaths of the stroke patients.\n\n30\n\n[0008] The accurate stroke subtypes classification module predicts specific subtypes of\n\nstroke for the stroke patients. The module receives clinical data of the stroke patients as\n\nDocket No. UM1104HK00\n\n2\n\nHK 30057394 A\n\nthe module's input, processes the clinical data through one or more networks of machine learning model and deep learning model, then generates and outputs specific subtypes\n\nof the stroke.\n\n5", "type": "Document"}}
