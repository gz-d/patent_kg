These algorithmic descriptions and/or representations are the means employed by those cognizant in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others equally skilled. An algorithm is here, generally, conceived to be a self-con- sistent sequence of acts leading to a desired result. The acts are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quan- tities. Typically, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical and/or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and/or other- wise", "type": "Document"}}
