The planar battery charging system as claimed in claim rein said second-stage power inverter comprises a reso- nant tank that sets the frequency of said AC current supplied said winding.\n\nThe first-stage power converter may be selected from boost, buck, flyback, Cuk and Sepic type converters but is not restricted thereto. The second-stage power inverter can be a full-bridge, half-bridge, or Class-D and Z-source type con- verter but again is not restricted thereto. The second-stage power inverter can use a step-down transformer so that a relatively high DC-link voltage can be used in order to reduce the current in the resonant capacitor for a given power requirement.\n\n7. The planar battery charging system as claimed in claim wherein said second-stage power inverter is switched at constant frequency that is equal to the frequency of the reso- nant tank.\n\n8. The planar battery charging system as claimed wherein the secondary side is adapted to receive excitation frequency of the primary winding. in claim power\n\n9. The planar battery charging system as claimed in claim wherein the first-stage power converter comprises one of boost converter, a buck converter, a flyback converter, a Cuk converter, and a Sepic converter.", "type": "Document"}}
