The required cost is 15.7.\n\n[0173] The linear programming problem may be setup follows:\n\n[0187] These embodiments may be advantageous in that the color coding system uses codes which are simpler than some other coding system such as the hexadecimal repre- sentation and eight-digital representation. Based on the prime-number theory, the numerical codes are compact digits which may include richer information of colors.\n\nMIN obj=!255-17,-E 3 w,c,|41255-g,-E Fwyn,|+1255\u2014 6,- Pwy;|, where w,, wz W320\n\n(the symbol \u201cIQ|\u201d means the absolute term of Q)\n\n[0174] In Example 1, the color fitting module determines the mixing weights based on a minimum difference between each of the basic colors of the first color and equivalent color components in the first color representation of the second color obtained by a combination of the two or more available colors, i.e. to find the weights on the mixture of three CMYK colors thus to minimize the difference between the target RGB colors and the mixed CMYK colors.\n\n[0188] Advantageously, the numerical codes provide manipulability of the mapped colors. It is convenient to find related colors and to mix/segregate colors using simple conversion functions. Manipulating tools may be used to merge, edit, and mix colors precisely.\n\ncolors 3,0.\n\n2,\n\n0),\n\nis\n\nas\n\na\n\n\u5165\n\nDaye\n\nof", "type": "Document"}}
