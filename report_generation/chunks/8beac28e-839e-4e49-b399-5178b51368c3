An electrolyte for use in an electrical energy storage comprising:\n\n[0243] With reference to FIG. 27, an alternative embodi- ment of the present invention is provided. In this example, the energy storage is a supercapacitor, such as a symmetrical supercapacitor 2700. The capacitor 2700 comprises the AD-gel electrolyte and a pair of carbon nanotube paper/ polypyrrole (CNT@PPy) electrodes was fabricated. Capaci- tive behaviors of the supercapacitor 2700 were investigat- eded over the temperature range from -20\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C. through CV and GCD profiles (FIGS. 28A and 28B). As shown in FIG. 28A, all the CV curves were of close- rectangular shape in all temperature scale, suggesting good ionic conductivity of the AD-gel electrolyte at extreme temperatures.\n\nhydrogel and an electrolytic solution retained by the hydrogel; and\n\npolymeric layer substantially encapsulating the hydro- gel and forming at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel;\n\nwherein the polymeric layer is arranged to prevent water escaping from the hydrogel structure.\n\n2. The electrolyte for use in an electrical energy storage device according to claim 1, wherein the at least one crosslinked structure of the polymeric layer includes a first crosslinked structure defined by a plurality of polymer chains of a first polymeric material that form at least one covalent bond with the hydrogel.\n\n[0244] The capacitance of the supercapacitor 2700 after subjecting to heating and cooling cycles between -20\u00b0 C., 25\u00b0 C., and 80\u00b0 C., appeared to be almost same as the one at 25\u00b0 C. (FIG. 28C). These results demonstrated the prom- ising applications of AD-gel electrolyte in diverse electrical energy storage devices.", "type": "Document"}}
