Even the device is surrounded by 4 cm-thick animal tissues (e.g., pork), the voltage on the resistor can reach 6.6 V under the 1 W power input from a 6-cm coil. FIG. 7 shows an in vitro test result for energy transfer capabilities of the present device activated by coils with different size and turns shows that among three different transmission coil configurations: (a) coil A (diameter=4.5 cm, 8 turns); (b) coil B (diameter=6 cm, 5 turns); and (c) coil C (diameter=6 cm, 4 turns), when they are disposed adjacent to slices of pig tissue, including skin, fat and muscle, with a thickness between 5 and 40 mm (d-f), the device with coil C can deliver a power up to 121 mW (i) (input power=5 W, resonance frequency=6.5 MHz, load resistance=5 KQ at a distance up to 4 cm), which is higher than other two coils (g and h), thus coil C is preferred among the three for further testing its transfer efficiency of coil C with different load resistances. FIG. 2E shows that the high voltage can accelerate the degradation process of Mg oils, though the antenna can receive high power and output the high voltage. Since a small voltage is enough for initiating most of the tissue regeneration therapies, an elec- tric pulse of several hundred microvolts is thereby utilized or electrostimulation therapy (inset in FIG. 2F) in the present device for avoiding tissue carbonization at a pro- longed stimulation, while the lifespan of the device can be enhanced. The electric current from the electrostimulation also improves release of charged drug/substance from the\n\nmicroneedles due to the electromotive force.", "type": "Document"}}
