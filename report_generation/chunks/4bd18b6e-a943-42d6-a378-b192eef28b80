Such condition information may include any information that relates to or otherwise associated with the condition of the device before, during and after operation or the performance of any tasks. Such condition information or device data may be specific to the device itself, including operations status, health checks, operation duration, operat- ing rates, temperature, surrounding conditions ete or any information that is associated with the status or health of the device itself. As the person skilled in the art would appre- ciate, such condition information will depend on the specific device that is being monitored as condition information will be different for a range of different devices.\n\n[0049] FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an example group- ing of operation information into a source domain set and a target domain set for training the conditions monitoring engine of FIG. 2;\n\n[0050] FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating an example method of training one or more learning networks;\n\n[0051] FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating an example training process of a learning network for use with the device modelling engine of FIG. 3;\n\n[0052] FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating method steps of the training process of the learning network of FIG. 7; and,\n\n[0053] FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating method steps of the training process of the learning network of FIG. 7.", "type": "Document"}}
