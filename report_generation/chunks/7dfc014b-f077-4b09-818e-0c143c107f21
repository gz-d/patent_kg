For example, a component can be a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and a compo- nent can be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers.\n\nWhat is claimed is:\n\nmented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof to control a computer to implement the disclosed. subject matter. The term \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d as used herein can encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer readable media can include, but is not limited to, magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips . . . ), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD)... ), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., card, stick, key drive .. .). Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed. to carry computer-readable electronic data such as those used. in transmitting and receiving electronic mail or in accessing a 55\n\n1.
