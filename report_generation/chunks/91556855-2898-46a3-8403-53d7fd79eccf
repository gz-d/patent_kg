For wearers who have a higher ratio of a wearer\u2019s thumb width to his/her index finger length (Le., large thumb over short index finger), the moving range is smaller, and the sensor signal range is also smaller, and vice versa. To reduce the effect of this problem, in some embodiments, a personalized model is a normalized/calibrated generic model with the aforesaid parameters taken into consideration.\n\nFIG. 14 shows a result of mean squared error (MSE) of each regression model. To examine the smoothness of the simulated real-time tracking, the 2nd derivative of the regression result after applying our customized Kalman Filter. A smaller 2nd derivative value reveals a smoother regression result. Tables (a), (b) in the FIG. 14 show result of our experiments on the generic models and the person- alized models respectively. For the generic models, e-SVR. model shows the smallest MSE, while MLP model has the smoothest prediction. Although MLP model shows the best smoothness, it relies on large data for a better convergence. In practice, it is reasonable to collect a small amount of data from a new wearer for calibration. Such calibration data may also be used for training a personalized model for a better\n\nperformance.\n\nBy the assistance of the classification ML model, a first and a second ML models, the interactive wearable device analyzes a movement event caused by two fingers of an wearer. The analysis process is fully described as follows.\n\nFIG. 15 depicts a step flow chart of an analysis process the interactive wearable device 100.", "type": "Document"}}
