Positive current direction means that the PV device being operated in a generative mode. Negative current direction means that the PV device being operated in a diagnosis mode. When the sensed current direction is positive, the current sensing signal V_Isen has a high-level value representing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d. When the sensed current direction is negative, the current sensing signal V_Isen has a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d.\n\nBy making use of the PV effect that voltage across a PV device rises when the PV device is illuminated, the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen may be provided by a voltage sensor (not shown) configured to detect a change in voltage across the PV device in response to illumination by an artificial light when the PV device is forward-biased. In particular, when a change in voltage across the PV device is detected, the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen has a high-level value representing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d. When no change in voltage across the PV device is detected, the voltage sensing signal V_Vsen has a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d.", "type": "Document"}}
