FIG. 11 depicts a diagram of an example graph 1100 of input voltage and input current for the diode bridge when associated with a capacitive-resistive load. As can be seen in graph 1100, input current pulses are observed as expected for a capacitive-resistive load. FIG. 12 illustrates a diagram of an example graph 1200 of example gate-source voltage signals (Vgs) of the high-side portion switches (e.g., switches 202 and 204, which can be (VCSD) MOSFETs) (represented respectively as a pink-colored. waveform and a green-colored waveform) of the SDSR and. the input voltage (represented as a blue-colored waveform) in relation to a capacitive-resistive load (e.g., when the system 200 is subject to a capacitive-resistive load), wherein the capacitive-load is the same as that for the conventional diode bridge. In relation to the graph 1200, FIG. 13 depicts a dia- gram of an example graph 1300 comprising corresponding gate-source voltage signals (Vgs) for the low-side portion switches (e.g., switches 206 and 208 (CCSD) MOSFETs) (represented respectively as a pink-colored waveform and a green-colored waveform) of the SDSR, the input voltage (represented as a blue-colored waveform), and the input cur- rent (represented as a green-colored waveform), in relation to the same capacitive-resistive load, in accordance with an aspect. It is noted that, with regard to FIG. 13, the input current (green-colored waveform in FIG. 13) looks the same as, or at least substantially the same as, a typical expected current waveform for a conventional diode bridge with a", "type": "Document"}}
