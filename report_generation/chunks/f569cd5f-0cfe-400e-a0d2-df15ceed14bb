In particular the flexural member may comprise concrete, for example FRP bar or steel bar reinforced concrete, such as a concrete structural member such as a beam or column. Pref- erably the ductile compressive material comprises elasto- plastic or nearly elasto-plastic material. Possible materials for the ductile compressive material include metallic materials such as steel and alloys, cementitious material, plastics, elas- tomeric materials such as rubber, rubber cement material, composite material or combinations thereof.\n\nProviding confinement to concrete. Confinement increases ductility/deformability of concrete, however, this method cannot avoid the rupture of non-ductile bars for under-rein- forced beams. For over-reinforced beams or columns with significant axial load, heavy and excessive confinement rein- forcement is usually needed to achieve the ductility require- ment;\n\nAnother method of producing a very ductile compression zone is by providing or forming holes (such as voids bubbles) inside normal concrete or inside other materials such as plastic materials, metallic materials, composite mate- rials or other materials.\n\nPlacing prestressed reinforcement in layers and design the effective prestress in each layer so as to provide a step-by-step progressive failure with increasing deformation.
