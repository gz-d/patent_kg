A aspect the building block of modern electronics, field effect transistor, consisting of four major componerts, |.e., the gate, source, drain and substrate, respectively, which can dynamically gate transport of carriers between the source and the drain when an external voltage is applied gate. Please see Fig. 1a. Fig. 16 shows the schematic drawing of our transistor-like electricity generator, termed as TIDE-G, in which the source is made of a transparent ITO and the drain of an Al electrode.\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nin\n\nconsists\n\nA second aspect is concerned with behavior of continuous droplet impinging serving as\n\na\n\nfacile method to induce high charge density on PTFE. PTEE has been found to be a promising electret material with high charge storage capability and stability. As shown in Fig. Tc and Fig. there is a gradual increase in the surface charge with the progression in the times of droplet impinging. Experiments leading to the present invention nave shown that the PTFE surface serve as arich charge reservoir to electrostatically Induce opposite charges of the same amount and ensure a continuous and reversible charge transfer. Since PTFE electret is associated high charge storage density whose stability can be also preserved by continuous droplet Impinging, It serves as a virtual source. When a falling droplet spreads on the PTFE surface, induces the charge transfer between the ITO source and drain, bridging the originally disconnected terminals into a closed-system, a process reminiscence of the formation of gate channel under action of gate voltage in the case of FET. The dynamic formation of the gate-like channel in TIDE-G is also accompanied by the concurrent building of electrical double layers (EDLs) at both\n\nITO\n\nwith\n\n1,\n\ncan\n\non\n\nIt\n\nthe\n\nour", "type": "Document"}}
