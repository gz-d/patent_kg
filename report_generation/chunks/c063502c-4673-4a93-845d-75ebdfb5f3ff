Dual microprocessors and other multiprocessor architectures also can be employed as processing unit 1414.\n\nunit 1414 through the system bus 1418 via interface port(s) 1438. Interface port(s) 1438 include, for example, a serial port, a parallel port, a game port, and a universal serial bus (USB). Output device(s) 1440 use some of the same type of ports as input device(s) 1436. Thus, for example, a USB port may be used to provide input to computer 1412, and to output information from computer 1412 to an output device 1440. Output adapter 1442 is provided to illustrate that there are some output devices 1440 like monitors, speakers, and print- ers, among other output devices 1440, which require special adapters. The output adapters 1442 include, by way of illus- tration and not limitation, video and sound cards that provide a means of connection between the output device 1440 and the system bus 1418. It should be noted that other devices and/or systems of devices provide both input and output capa-\n\nThe system bus 1418 can be any of several types of bus structure(s) including the memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus or external bus, and/or a local bus using any variety of available bus architectures including, but not lim- ited to, Industrial Standard Architecture (ISA), Micro-Chan- nel Architecture (MSA), Extended ISA (EISA), Intelligent Drive Electronics (IDE), VESA Local Bus (VLB), Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Card Bus, Universal Serial Bus (USB), Advanced Graphics Port (AGP), Personal Com- puter Memory Card International Association bus (PCM- CIA), Firewire (IEEE 1394), and Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI).", "type": "Document"}}
