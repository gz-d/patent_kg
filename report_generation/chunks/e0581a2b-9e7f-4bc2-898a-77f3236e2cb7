For example, non-limiting implementation of a GA 500 can fabricated and tested using, for example, exemplary SPA elements 102 and a plurality of Wilkinson power dividers 1400. In addition, ground plane 504 of exemplary non-limit- ing embodiment of GA 300 can comprise conducting plates (e.g., 3 pieces of conducting plates each with a size of L,xW,). Thus, it can be understood that the area of ground lane 504 is larger than that of ground plane 304 ofexemplary non-limiting embodiment of GA 300 by approximately 50%.\n\nIn yet other exemplary implementations of methodologies 2000, a portion of the incident solar radiation can be con- verted into an electrical potential for use by the communica- tions antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.) at 2008. For instance, meth- odologies 2000 can further include converting a portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., such incident light 322 (522),\n\n1706 tion\n\nopera-\n\nor\n\netc.\n\n15\n\n40\n\n45\n\nmat-\n\nter\n\n2\n\nUS 8,599,081 B2\n\n17\n\n18\n\n(0\u201310) 2908 and flat (0\u20130) ground 2906 planes.
