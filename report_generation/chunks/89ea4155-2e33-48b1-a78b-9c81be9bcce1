In the illustrated form p type semiconductor element 712 is attached to an inner surface of the first substrate 702. The p type semicon- ductor element 712 is in the form of a flexible planar film or a flexible planar sheet disposed on the substrate 702. The n type semiconductor element 714 is a planar member dis- posed on the second substrate 703. In the illustrated form the n type semiconductor element 714 is attached on an inner surface of the second substrate 703. The n type semicon- ductor element 714 is in the form of a flexible planar film or a flexible planar sheet disposed on the second substrate 703.\n\n[0180] FIG. 8B shows a plot of a single electrical pulse 810 i.e. a current pulse from the plot 800 of FIG. 8A. The current signal has a 0 current or low current region 812 which represents a non-contact time. When a finger contact is detected a voltage is induced and current flows through the thermoelectric modules. The pulse comprises a heating cycle 814 i.e. a period of rise time of the current signal. The time the pulse remains high indicates the contact time 816 between the sensor and the finger. Once the finger is lifted off the sensor 700 i.e. no contact or no heat the current is dissipated through a dissipation cycle 818.", "type": "Document"}}
