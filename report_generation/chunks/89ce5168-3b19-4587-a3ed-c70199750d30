The disks with coatings (10 mg of samples of different weight ratios UP,-Cy, UP,-C, UPi-Cs) were put on the center of the LB agar plates after bacteria seeding. These plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and the photographs of the inhibition zones were recorded by Leica camera.\n\nin the results of the nano-indentation test whereby composition UP,-C, had an elastic modulus of 420 MPa, composition UP,-C, had an elastic modulus of 210 MPa, and composition UP, -Cs had an elastic modulus of 85 MPa.\n\n[0142] Further, with reference to FIG. 3, for composition UPi-Cz, temperature-dependent dynamic mechanical analy- sis (DMA) analysis showed that the elastic modulus dropped rapidly from 110 MPa at room temperature to 0.9 MPa at 100\u00b0 C., showing that the composition exhibits high strength at room temperature and exhibits healable characteristics at temperatures higher than 60\u00b0 C.\n\n[0152] FIGS. 7A-7C are the results from the antimicrobial test on gram-positive bacteria for UP,-C;, UP,-C,, UP,-Co, respectively.
