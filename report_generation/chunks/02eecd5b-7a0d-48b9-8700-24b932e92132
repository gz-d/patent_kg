In one embodiment, when two isosbestic wavelengths, ie. 532 nm and 545 nm, are used, the absorp- tion coefficients at the two wavelengths will be independent of oxygen saturation and Hi/ is a known constant. In the second photoacoustic excitation, AT is modelled as\n\nAT=aF yu, et (2)\n\nwhere a and b are constant coeflicients, Ph is proportional to the first photoacoustic excitation, the exponential decay describes the thermal clearance related to thermal conduc- tion and convection, Tu is a time constant related to thermal conduction, v is the flow speed.

In superficial tissue, the ratio of F, to F, can be approximated from the tissue surface fluences. To calibrate A, Tu\u3002 and b, the flow speed v and time delays dt can be set to different values and then the three coeflicients can be fit from the photoacoustic measurements. If a different St equals to xdt, other parameters (e.g. surface fluence) remain the same and. flow speed is set to zero, then equation (3) can be simplified as m=Ae~*** and n=Ae\u201c*\u2122\" respectively for time delays dt and dt\u2019.
