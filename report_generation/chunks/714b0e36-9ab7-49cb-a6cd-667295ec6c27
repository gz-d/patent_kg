The module contains only one butterfly unit, which consumes two DSPs. The cycle counts of length n NTT/INTT mainly includes n/2x2 cycles for FIFOs reading and writing, n/2xlog,n cycles for NTT calculation and 15xlog,n cycles for pipeline delay in different NTT stages. The hybrid structure uses the same computing cycles for both NIT and INTT computation, which is 1405 cycles in Dilithium of n=256 and g=8380417. The critical path in this module lies in the modular reduction unit.\n\neters, it could also multiply a variable-length polynomial- vector by a polynomial. There are two modular multiplication units in the PWM module to match the transmission speed of input and output FIFOs. The PWM module needs n/2 cycles to read the first polynomial. The reading time of the later polynomials is buried into the pipeline computation. There are n/2xk cycles for point-wise multiplication and 8 cycles for modular multiplication in the pipeline. When the polynomial vector length k under test is set to 6 (i.e. the length of NIST security level 3), the cycle cost is 911.
