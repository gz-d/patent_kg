Prefer- ably, the Sn, Bi and In are mixed at a weight ratio ranging from about 1:1:2 to about 1:3:5; more preferably, the Sn, Bi and In are mixed at a weight ratio of about 1:3:3. The mixture is sintered via procedures and/or tools well known in the art, as long as the process involves a thermal and pressured environment where atoms of the materials diffuse across the particle boundaries and fuse together into one piece. In one working example, the mixture is sintered at 600-800\u00b0 C. for 1 to 3 hours. According to some embodi- ments of the present disclosure, the thus produced bulk alloy has a melting point of about 60-such as about 60\u00b0 C. In one preferred embodiment, the bulk alloy is produced by mixing Sn, Bi, and In at the weight ratio of about 1:3:3, and has a of about 62\u00b0 C.\n\nmelting point\n\n[0051] In an alternative or optional embodiment of the present disclosure, in step (a), the mixture may further comprise an element other than Sn, Bi, or In. Specifically, one or more additional elements can be added with Sn, Bi, and In, to form the mixture. The element may be selected from the group consisting of Pb, Zn, and Ag. Preferably, the element is Pb, in such case, Sn, Bi, In and Pb are mixed at a weight ratio of 1:1:2:0.1 to 1:3:5:0.5 to form a mixture.", "type": "Document"}}
