The dimen- sions of the PCB transformer under test are detailed in Table I. The primary and secondary windings are printed on the opposite sides of a PCB. The PCB laminate is made of FR4 material. The dielectric breakdown voltage of typical FR4 laminates range from 15 kV to 40 kV. Insulating layers between the copper windings and the ferrite plates should have high thermal conductivity in order to facilitate heat transfer from the transformer windings to the ferrite plates and the ambient. The insulating layer should also be a good electrical insulator to isolate the ferrite plates from the printed transformer windings. A thermally conductive sili- cone rubber compound coated onto a layer of woven glass fibre, which has breakdown voltage of 4.5 kV and thermal conductivity of 0.79 Wm7'K\"', is used to provide high dielectric strength and facilitate heat transfer. The ferrite plates placed on the insulating layers are made of 4F1\n\nFIG. 10 shows measured magnetic field intensity of a PCB transformer without shielding and in no load condition,\n\nFIG. 11 shows simulated magnetic field intensity of PCB transformer with ferrite shielding in accordance with prior art and in no load condition,\n\nFIG. 12 shows measured magnetic fie!
