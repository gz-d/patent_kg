As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, both diction- aries were learned with the same training sequences and learning parameters. The difference is that the spatial dic- tionary was learned from the conventional image patches while the temporal dictionary was learned from the patches extracted from temporal layers. It is observed from FIGS. 7A and 7B that the learned temporal dictionary, when compared with the spatial dictionary, has more regular and sharper edges which reflect the motion information of the objects in the video. The atom with the vertical edges represents a motionless pattern while atoms with straight edges of other directions represent uniform motion patterns, and atoms with bending edges denote motion patterns with variable velocity. Therefore, the learned temporal dictionary is suitable to capture the temporal activity of the video. The goal of temporal dictionary learning is to learn the normal temporal activity non-flicker distortion. Thus, when the learned dictionary is employed upon the original and dis- torted synthesized videos via the sparse representation, the flicker distortion existing in the distorted videos could be\n\nkell, ih\n\naveragely merged, and the integral similarity for patches locating (u, v) at\n\nFisk (10) Guys a (aoe. \u5929 \u751f, \u5c0f SDH1\n\nwhere h is the number of temporal layers for averaging, k is an index of U;,, and a and b are parameters denoting weights of amplitude and phase distortion.
