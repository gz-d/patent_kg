Some embodiments of the invention may have one or more additional or alternative functions and/or applications not described or illustrated. For example, some embodi- ments of the metasurface antenna can dynamically, simul- taneously, independently, and precisely manipulate all of the fundamental properties of EM waves, including amplitude, phase, momentum, frequency, and polarization. For example, some embodiments of the metasurface antenna can facilitate information manipulations by directly generating the modulated waveforms with animate wave properties, which may lead to a paradigm shift for new information- transmitting architectures. For example, some embodiments of the metasurface antenna can enable control of angular momentum (e.g., for the 2D case). For example, some embodiments of the metasurface antenna can include one or more of the following merits, including full-dimensional wave controllability, inherent information directional modu- lation, simplified coding scheme (e.g., 1 bit), free of side- band pollution, and potential on-chip integration, making the metasurface antenna an appealing enabler for applica- tions in the next-generation large-capacity and high-security\n\ninformation systems, cognitive sensing, imaging, etc.", "type": "Document"}}
