For example, in one cycle, the second transistor of the first oscillator may provide third harmonic power to the second patch element for about half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously), and the second transistor of the second oscil- lator may provide third harmonic power to the second patch element for about another half of the cycle (cumulatively or continuously).\n\n[0029] In some embodiments, the first patch element belongs to a portion (e.g., half) of a larger patch.\n\n[0030] In some embodiments, the second patch element belongs to a portion (e.g., half) of a larger patch.\n\nis\n\nis\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nIn\n\nin\n\nthe transmis-\n\n[0031] some embodiments, plan view, sion line of the even-mode-shorted coupler is disposed between the first patch element and the second patch ele- ment.\n\n[0032] In some embodiments, in plan view, the first patch element and the second patch element are generally sym- metrically disposed about an axis of reflection symmetry.
