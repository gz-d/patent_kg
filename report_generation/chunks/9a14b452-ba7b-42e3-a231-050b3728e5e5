The cyclic group may be aromatic or non-aromatic.\n\n[0078] As used herein, \u201ccomprising\u201d means including the following elements but not excluding others. \u201cEssentially consisting of\u2019 means that the material consists of the respec- tive element along with usually and unavoidable impurities such as side products and components usually resulting from the respective preparation or method for obtaining the material such as traces of further components or solvents. \u201cConsisting of\u201d means that the material solely consists of, i.e. is formed by the respective element.\n\n[0086] The term \u201csubstituted\u201d as used herein includes all substituents of compounds permissible in the context of the chemical rules of valence known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some cases, substituted may generally refer to replacement of a hydrogen atom with a substituent as\n\n[0079] present provides a composition includes one or more monomeric units. The monomeric unit has a structure of Formula (I):\n\nee N XQ XQ N. \u540c \u548c XQ HN\u2019 \u4e00 \u52a0 - na TT Ne. PR \u4e0b Nab, Nw NH O 0 0 \u4eba \u4eba N H", "type": "Document"}}
