An exponential model can be used to quantify the blood flow speed from two photoacoustic measurements. Based on the exponential model, the error in sO, quantification can also be compensated for. Simultane- ous multi-parameter imaging can be achieved. Dual-pulse flowmetry of the above embodiments can accurately, quickly, and efficiently measure blood flow speed. It requires only two photoacoustic measurements in sub-microseconds. Unlike conventional functional OR-PAM, the dual-pulse lowmetry and three- -wavelength OR-PAM do not need multiple repeated A-line imaging at one spot, which saves imaging time, increases throughput, and may mitigate poten- tial motion artifacts. This technical advance enables functional at the sub-microseconds scale.\n\ndynamic\n\nimaging\n\n[0098] Compared with the existing systems and methods, system(s) and method(s) in the above embodiments include one or more of the following advantages:\n\nthe\n\n[0099] 1. Conventional flowmetry measurement is at dozens of millisecond scale; the flow measurement method/system of the above embodiment(s) is at sub- microsecond scale, which can realize the real-time flowmetry measurement considering the normal blood flow is at several millisecond scale.\n\nspeed\n\n[0100] 2. Conventional method/system calculates the flow speed from hundreds of measurements; the flow measurement method/system of the above embodiment (s) can obtain flow speed from a single-shot.\n\n[0101] 3. Conventional method/system can hardly simultaneously measure multiple physiological param- eters, in particular hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and blood flow; the method/system of the above embodiment(s) can simultaneous imaging of multiple physiological parameters, in particular hemo- globin concentration, oxygen saturation, and blood flow with a single raster scan.\n\n[0102]\n\n4.
