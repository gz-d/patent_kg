Within the category of building energy consumption, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) generally accounts for the largest proportion. Energy saving and emission mitigation by utilizing renew- able energy and waste heat in HVAC have been widely encouraged.\n\n[0003] Cooling, heating, and dehumidification by renew- able/waste energy are promising for building energy usage reduction and emission mitigation. However, the intermit- tent nature of renewable/waste energy results in inefficient and under-utilization of these energy sources.\n\nThermal\n\nis able\n\n[0004] energy storage to play a significant role in balancing the energy supply and energy demand. Thermal energy storage may be considered as temporarily maintaining thermal energy in the form of hot or cold substances, phase changes of phase change materials, or chemical reactions. By reversing the energy storage (for example changing phase from liquid to solid), the stored energy is released at a later time for use. Thermal energy storage can increase the efficiency of building energy sys- tems by storing energy between the time when thermal energy is produced and the time when the stored energy can be used by the building. For example, a peak load demand can be shifted to off-peak hours by utilizing stored heat from thermal unit.\n\nenergy\n\na\n\nenergy storage", "type": "Document"}}
