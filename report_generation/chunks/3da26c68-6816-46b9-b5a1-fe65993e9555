The preference decision-making task was a two-alternative-forced-choice task, which contained two parts. In part 1, participants were presented with 120 (female and male) computer generated, bald faces. They were asked to rate, from 1 to 7, how attractive the faces were. These ratings were used for pairing stimuli for part 2 and the eye movements were not analyzed. After part 1 was finished, the faces of the same gender that received similar ratings were paired to form 60 pairs as the stimuli In part 2. In part 2, in each trial, each pair of faces was shown on the screen with one on the left and one on the nght. Participants were required indicate which face they preferred. There was no time limit. Participants could move their eyes freely to compare the two images. They were told to press a button to indicate which face (left or right) they preferred once they had made their decision.
