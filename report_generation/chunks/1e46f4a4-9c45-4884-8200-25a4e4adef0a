As explained previ- ously, the use of the input inductor of a reasonably large size is to reduce the LED power sensitivity against input voltage variation. The relationship of the variation of the output cur- rent (which affects the LED power) with the input voltage variation has been shown as:\n\nfthe valley-fill circuit in FIG. 18 is not used, the front-end diode rectifier provides a rectified output voltage as shown in FIG. 27. It can be seen that the rectified DC voltage peaks at the maximum value of the input sinusoidal voltage and then rops to zero. However, when the valley-fill circuit is pro- vided with C1=C2=220 uF, the output DC voltage feeding the filter inductor L and LED load has a much reduced voltage ripple as displayed in FIG. 28(a). In this case, the maximum voltage is close to 180V and minimum voltage is close to 90V.\n\nAVs 0574 als Al, =\n\nThe output de current can be expressed as:\n\ntt should be noted that smaller capacitors such as C1=C2=22 HEF can also be used. For capacitance of this low magnitude, electrolytic capacitors which have short lifetimes are not needed. FIG. 28(4) shows the output DC voltage of the valley-fill circuit with these smaller capacitors. Also voltage charging and discharging in the capacitors becomes obvious, as shown in FIG. 28(4), but the average voltage is close to that in FIG. 28(a).\n\nwa \u4e00 59574075\n\nThis equation means that the size of the input inductor can affect the power of the LED load. If the inductance of the input inductor Ls can be changed, a dimming function becomes possible. By using a variable inductor Ls as shown. in FIG. 24, the power control of the LED load can be achieved.", "type": "Document"}}
