The control circuit 200 includes five resistors 202-210 connected in series. The first resistor 202 includes a resistance R' the second resistor 204 includes a resistance R, the third resistor 206 includes a resistance 2R, the fourth resistor 208 includes a resistance 4R, and the fifth resistor 210 includes a resistance 8R. The second to fourth resistors 204-210 are each respective connected with a respective switch 214-220 in the form of a photo-relay. The photo- relays are connected to a controller 230, which indepen- dently control the on/off of each of the switches 214-220, to adjust an equivalent resistance across the nodes A and B. The resulting equivalent resistances at different configurations (different on/off of the switches 214-220) are shown in FIG. 3.
