For example, each may include a para- magnetic material that can be magnetized and induced by an external applied magnetic field. For example, each may include DT4E material, low carbon steel (1008 steel, 1010 steel), pure iron, or cast iron, or the like.\n\nFIGS. 3A-3B illustrates\n\n[0057] 300\n\nan electromagnetic according to certain embodiments of the present inven- tion. The electromagnetic device 300, for example, can be specific implementation of electromagnetic device 102 104 with reference to FIG. 1.\n\ndevice\n\na\n\nor\n\n[0058] Compared with the electromagnetic device 200, the electromagnetic device 300 additionally includes actuation means for actuating a relative movement between the mag- netic core 320 and the elongated sleeve 310 of the electro- magnetic device 300 such that the workspace can be modi- fied or adjusted.\n\n[0059] By way of example and as illustrated, the actuation means includes a motor 350, such as a servo motor, that is coupled to one end (such as the second end) of the magnetic core 320 via a connector 360. Specifically, one end of the connector 360 connects to the magnetic core 320, while the other end of the connector 360 connects to a lead screw shaft 352. The motor 350 can be electrically powered so as to drive the lead screw shaft 352. The output of the lead screw shaft 352, via the connector 360, drives the magnetic core 320 to move linearly relative to the elongated sleeve 310.\n\nboundary of\n\nAs the core tip 326 is located on the\n\n[0060]", "type": "Document"}}
