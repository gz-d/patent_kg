During the start-up phase, the capaci- tors C,, C4 and C, will be charged up as the power supplies of the first-stage. Before the capacitors C,,C, and C, have been charged up to an applicable predefined threshold voltage (e.g., 10V), the driving logic in the SDGD subsystem will not be ready to fully function to facilitate controlling respective switching of the switches 2102 through 2112.\n\nThe SDGD subsystem is designed to consume a relatively low amount of power, and can be powered by and receive power from the output rectified DC signal from the SDSR. In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem can be formed as an integrated circuit. In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can be divided into a desired number of parts, such as, for example, two parts comprising a high-side portion and low-side por- tion. The high-side portion and low-side portion can be sym- metrical.", "type": "Document"}}
