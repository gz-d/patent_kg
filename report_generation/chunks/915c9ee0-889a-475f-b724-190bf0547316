The locking elements 62 can be made of various mate- such as an NiTi alloy.\n\nThe locking elements 62 can be used in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more locking elements 62 can be set in a closed position at the time of surgery to retain the support members 10, 10a, and 104 in an appropriate position while other locking elements 62 can be set at an open. position. When the spine correction comes to finish or satis- factory, the closed locking elements 62 can be opened and the open locking element 62 can be closed. In another exemplary embodiment, the locking elements 62 can be set in an open position at the time of surgery to retain the support members 10, 10a, and 104 in an appropriate position. When the correc- tion comes to a full or substantially full completion, the locking elements 62 can then be tightened.\n\nIn another exemplary embodiment, one or more transverse traction members 32 can be provided to generate an indepen- dent constant or substantially constant correction force. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in FIG. 4, the trans- verse traction members 32 can be provided to join between the first and second support members 10a and 106. In one exemplary embodiment, the transverse traction members 32 are capable of adjusting the magnitude of the correction force generated by the second support member 10. For example, each transverse traction member 32 can provide an indepen- dent correction force to reinforce or reduce the value of the constant correction force so that the correction device 1 is capable of providing a constant correction force of a different value than that generated by the second support member 105. Exemplary transverse traction members 32 can include, but are not limited to, superelastic spring members, adjustable internal boxes, and the like.", "type": "Document"}}
