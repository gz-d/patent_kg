The electrodes positioned at opposing ends of the substrate 102.\n\n[0152] As shown in FIG. 1A, the thermoelectric modules 110 are arranged in an in-plane layout i.e. the semiconductor elements 112, 114 are arranged in an in-plane layout on the flexible substrate 102. Each of the semiconductor legs 112, 114 are positioned on a first face, face X. Face X is a flat face and is parallel to a horizontal plane that extends across the face X. The thermoelectric modules 110 are positioned on the face X i.e. the semiconductor elements 112, 114 are positioned flat on the face X. The first face (face X) is a user facing side and is an opposing face to a second face (face Y). In use, heat is applied to the second face (face Y). Face Y is in contact with a heat source e.g. face Y is in contact with a limb of a user. In-plane layout means the semiconductor elements and conductor elements are positioned such that they form a substantially planar layout on the face X of the substrate 102.\n\n[0148] The thermoelectric modules 110-110C are inter- connected to form a series electrical connection i.e. a series arrangement. The conductor members 116 define a conduc- tive path for the generated current to flow. The first electrode 104 and second electrode 106 are positioned at opposing ends of the flexible substrate 102. The first electrode 104 and the second electrode 106 are connected to the conductor members 116. An electrical path i.e. a conductive path is defined between the first electrode 104 and the second electrode 106 via the thermoelectric modules 110-110C.", "type": "Document"}}
