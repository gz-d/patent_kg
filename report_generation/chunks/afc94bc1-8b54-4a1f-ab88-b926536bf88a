Tris(2-carboxyethy])phos- phine (0.4 mM), tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine (40 uM), and CuSO 4 (0.4 mM) were then added. The reaction was kept at room temperature for 2 h.\n\n[0095] Affinity Enrichment of Biotinylated Proteins. After click chemistry reaction of KPlip or KPlip-C using biotin-azide (Bio-N,), chilled acetone was added to precipi- tate the proteins. The pellets were then washed with cold methanol and air-dried. The obtained pellets were redis- solved in PBS buffer containing less than 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) by heating and vortexing. Streptavi- din magnetic beads were then added and shaken gently at room temperature for 4 h. The beads were collected by a magnet and washed with 0.1% SDS/PBS once and PBS twice. The beads were redissolved in Ix SDS loading buffer, and proteins were released/denatured by boiling at 95\u00b0 C. for 20 min.\n\n[0096] In-Gel Digestion by Trypsin.\n\nThe pull-down sample was separated on 12% SOS-PAGE gel and stained with the Ruby protein staining method. The gel was cut into pieces. The collected gel was washed by 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, reduced by DTT (5 mM) at 50-60\u00b0 C. for 30 min, alkylated by iodoacetamide (25 mM) at room temperature for 45 min, dehydrated by 95% ethanol, and digested by sequencing grade modified trypsin at 37\u00b0 C. overnight. After that, the digested solution was collected. The gel was further extracted twice using 50% acetonitrile containing 5% formic acid. The combined solu- tion was dried by speed vacuum for LC-MS/MS analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
