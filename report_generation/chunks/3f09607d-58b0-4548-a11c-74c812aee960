In one embodiment of the first aspect, the metallic arrangement comprises a plurality of layers of metallic coating at the tip. The plurality of layers of metallic coating can be of the same metallic material or of different metallic materials.\n\n[0001] The invention relates to a device for providing electrons and its method of making.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Electron microscopes generally include a device for providing electrons. The device for providing electrons may be a thermionic tungsten filament that is resistively heated to release electrons, or may be a solid tungsten tip that is irradiated with an energy source (e.g., laser source) to provide electron beams. The electron or electron beams provided by the latter is generally more coherent and brighter. Problematically, however, accurately irradiating the tungsten tip, especially when the tip size is small, can be quite challenging.", "type": "Document"}}
