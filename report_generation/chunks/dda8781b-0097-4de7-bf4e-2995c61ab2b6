The method comprises combining a water-soluble salt precursor of nickel and a water-soluble salt precursor of the one or more M metals with one or more oxidizing agents to form an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution is alkalized to a selected pH value to produce precipitated precursors. The precipitated precursors are mixed with a lithium precursor to form a lithiated precursor. The lithiated precursor is calcined to form the nickel-rich lithium ion battery cathode material having a composition of LiNi,M,_,O,, where 0.6<x<0.9, and M is one or more metals selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn, Fe, Ti, Zr, V, and Cr.\n\n[0007] In another aspect, the invention provides a nickel- rich lithium ion battery cathode material having a compo- sition of LiNi,M,.,O,, where 0.6<x<0.9, and where M is one or more metals selected from the group consisting of Co, Mn, Fe, Ti, Zr, V, and Cr. The cathode material has a microstructure comprising primary particles with secondary particles formed on the surfaces of the primary particles, the primary particles having manipulated primary grain inter- faces with nickel ions on surfaces of the primary particles being oxidized from a 2+ to a 3+ state. The secondary particles are formed on the surfaces of the primary particles with a diameter of approximately 5-20 nm. The secondary particles are agglomerated with primary grains with mono- clinic grain boundaries, so there is a three-dimensional monoclinic grain boundary network spreading over each entire secondary particle.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0008] FIG. 1 shows XRD patterns for precursors pristine and oxidized Ni-rich materials.", "type": "Document"}}
