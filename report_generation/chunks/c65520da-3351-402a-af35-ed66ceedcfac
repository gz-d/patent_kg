The control unit of claim 1, wherein the control unit arranged to determine the first scanning direction and second scanning direction by determining an extent orthogonality of the first scanning direction and the second. scanning direction.\n\nspe- cifically described in the above embodiments, the inventions concerning the control unit and its method of operation can be applied in another imaging apparatus in another embodi- ment. The imaging apparatus would generally include an electron gun arranged to provide electron beam to scan a specimen and a deflector arranged to move the electron beam in a first scanning direction and a second scanning direction that are in the same plane for scanning the speci- men. The deflector may be formed by one or more deflective coils energized by a power source or a signal source (e.g., provided by the control unit). The equations presented above may be implemented or expressed in a different way, pro- vided they serve the same function to assist in processing the scanning directions and to determine a suitable control\n\n9.
