The interactions between substrate\n\nFabrication of TIDE - G Device . To fabricate the TIDE - G , a\n\natoms and NaCl water solution were described by 12-6 LJ\n\npiece of ITO glass slide of 30 mmx30 mmx0.4 mm was first\n\npotential ( Oxa - sub = 3.021 \u00c5 , Na - sub = 0.4785 kJ / mol , oa\n\nultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol for 10 mins ,\n\nsub = 3.476 \u00c5 ,\n\nEC1 - sub = 0.4785 kJ / mol , Oo - sub = 3.458 \u00c5 ,\n\nrespectively .
