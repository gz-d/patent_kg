An FSM is designed to indicate the computing state of Keccak core unit in FIG. 6C. If the Keccak core unit produce a valid output, the state will go to the output_state. In the output_state, when the 1-bit output_ready signal is high, the 1344-bit output from Keccak core unit is saved and the sampling process starts. In stage 1, the number selection block selects the bits of the sampled number and an address counter is used to generate the number address. There are two 23-bit output number from the samplers. The valid bit for each sampler is 4 bits in rej_eta sampling and 23 bits in rej_uniform sampling. Only the outputs of the SHAKE128 need to be sampled, while for the SHAKE256 output, the 64-bit number is sent to the output FIFO directly. In stage 2, two combined samplers are used for sampling. One 23-bit temporary number is the previously saved sampled numbers while the other two 23-bit numbers are the current sampled number. In stage 3, two 23-bit numbers will be selected to output if these numbers meet the requirements. In stage 4, the post transform computation is performed for the two selected numbers in rej_eta sampling. Since the two sam- plers accept two 4-bit numbers in one cycle during rej_eta sampling process, they need at least 168 cycles to complete the sampling, which is far more than 48 cycles in permuta- tion. Therefore, in rej_eta sampling, the output cycles may be extended to wait for the completion of the sampling process. This is because if the bit width of the sampler unit\n\nis enlarged, the used logic resources would be increased\n\nUS 2024/0143524 Al\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n12\n\nsignificantly. As long as the size of the short vector that needs to be sampled is relatively small, the extension of clock cycle is a better trade-off.", "type": "Document"}}
