The LED lighting system of claim 13, wherein said means for varying the AC input power comprises a variable inductor provided in series between the AC input and the diode rectification circuit.\n\nThus, specifying C1>C2 further reduces the output voltage ripple in the valley-fill circuit so as to reduce the ripple in the output inductor current and/or the size of the filter inductor.\n\n15. The LED lighting system of claim 14, wherein said variable inductor is provided with tapping control.\n\nIt will be noted that any capacitors, including electrolytic capacitors, can be used. However, non-electrolytic capacitors are preferred since these lead to longer lifetimes and higher reliability.\n\n16. The LED lighting system of claim 14, wherein said variable inductor is provided with an auxiliary winding hav- a DC current to alter a magnetic property of the core order to vary the inductance value of said variable inductor.\n\nAlthough the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention can be embodied in many other forms. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the features of the various examples described can be combined in other combinations.\n\n17.
