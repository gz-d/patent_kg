The resonator element may be hemispherical in shape with a surface defining the hemi- spherical shape comprising the light impinging surface, although any suitable lens shape that acts to focus light may be utilised. The resonator element may be shaped such that light impinging on a surface of said resonator element is focused by the resonator element towards a selected region of another surface of the resonator element. The resonator ele- ment may be a resonator element of a dielectric resonator antenna (DRA), said DRA comprising one of a plurality of DRAs arranged in a DRA array or a DRA reflect-array. An antenna array is a matrix of antennas used to increase the gain of an antenna system.\n\nThe electronic device preferably includes a device for gen- erating power from light impinging on said device, wherein said power generating device is located such that light impinging upon said device travels through at least a part of the DR element of the DRA. Preferably, the power generating device comprises a solar cell device. The gain of the DRA according to the invention is virtually not affected by the solar cell panel. Also, there is no need to remove any parts of the panel. Preferably, the DR element is shaped such that light impinging on a surface of said DR element is focused by the DR element towards a light receiving part of said solar cell.\n\nPreferably, the power generating device generates power said electronic device from light impinging on said elec- tronic device and conveyed to said power generating device the DR element of the DRA.", "type": "Document"}}
