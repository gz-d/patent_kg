However they are often considered either complicated, too time consuming, overly expensive, not very effective (i.e. limited increase in ductility).\n\nCurvature, and hence flexural deformation, are due to ten- sile and compression straining at a cross-section. When ten- sion yielding/deformation is unavailable, another avenue of achieving ductility/deformability is by compression yielding/ deformation. In principle, all the methods of achieving flex- ural ductility/deformability of RC members must fall into these two categories.\n\nConventional RC members reinforced with ductile bars also have ductility problems when the failure is caused by the compressive crushing of concrete in which the tensile rein- forcement does not yield. This occurs in over-reinforced RC beams and RC columns with a high axial load level. In this case the ductility and deformability of RC members are sig- nificantly reduced, although significant confinement to con- crete can partially offset this reduction. The more the tensile reinforcement in an RC beam, the less the tensile reinforce- ment deforms and hence the lower the deformability and ductility of the member. Similarly, the higher the axial load level in an RC column, the lower the ductility. Furthermore, the use of more brittle high strength concrete (HSC), which has been increasing in a fast rate over the last two decades, has a similar detrimental side-effect on the ductility of reinforced. concrete members especially for concrete columns.\n\nIt would be desirable to produce improved or alternative flexural members that overcame the problems associated with flexural members in the prior art.\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
