The power sup- ply component 322 can provide power to various components of the barrier control component 310, barrier component 308, and/or projector screen component 302. The power supply component 322 can be electrically and/or communicatively connected to the sensor component 316, and can receive power generated by the cell component 320, and can store that power in the battery component 324.\n\nIn other embodiments, the barrier control component 310 can have an external power supply that can be separate from the power supply component 322 (or can displace the power supply component 322) and can provide power to the barrier control component 310, and/or the barrier component 308 and/or projector screen component can be associated with an external power supply that can provide power to the respec- tive components.\n\nThe barrier control component 400 also can include an analyzer component 410 that can analyze information, such as optical signals obtained from the display screen compo- nent, mapping information, or other information, to facilitate identifying a control signal that corresponds to a detected optical signal, wherein the control signal can be sent to the associated barrier component to control switching of the bar- rier component.", "type": "Document"}}
