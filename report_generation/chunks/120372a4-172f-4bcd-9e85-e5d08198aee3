This is a typical feature of valley-fill circuits where C1 and C2 are identical. When the voltage V, is at its peak, the output volt- age of the valley-fill circuit, which is clamped by the voltage across the LED load, will reach its maximum value. The rectified input current charges the two identical capacitors C1 and C2 through the diode D, equally and hence the two capacitor voltages are equal at this moment. Note that this voltage for C2 (half of the maximum DC voltage) is the maximum voltage of C2. Therefore, only full maximum volt- age or half maximum voltage levels appear in the output voltage of the valley-fill circuit ifC1 and C2 are large enough and of equal capacitance. Note that the lower DC voltage is actually the voltage across C2. With a voltage ripple reduced\n\nThe variable inductor can be implemented in various forms. For example, FIG. 25 shows an inductor with tapping control. By controlling the switch or switches, labeled as S1 and S2 in the present embodiment, to determine the number of turns in the inductor, the inductance value can be con- trolled. FIG. 26 shows another implementation of a variable inductor using a DC current in an auxiliary winding to alter the magnetic property (such as saturation level) of the core in order to vary the inductance value.", "type": "Document"}}
