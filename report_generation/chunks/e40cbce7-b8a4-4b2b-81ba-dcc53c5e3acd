In addition to the coordi- nate efforts in operating such equipment efliciently, there is also a need to operate these plants and equipment safely as safety standards have improved over time.\n\n[0019] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the one or more hidden layers inserted by adding one or more hidden nodes into the hidden layers.\n\n[0020] In an embodiment of the first aspect, weights biases of the deep neural network are manipulated when neural network is adjusted.", "type": "Document"}}
