One example is described in GB2399225A which generates an AC electromagnetic flux 1 with the flux lines flowing \"hori- zontally\" along the charging surface 2 as shown in Fig.1A. A distributed winding is used in this charging platform for generating the AC flux. This principle is in fact similar to the AC electromagnetic flux generated in a cylindrical motor, except that the cylindrical structure is compressed into a flat pancake shape. As the flux needs to flow hor- izontally along the upper and lower surfaces, two inherent limitations arise. [0004] Firstly, an electromagnetic flux guide must be used to guide the flux along the bottom surface. This is usually a layer of soft magnetic material such as ferrite or amorphous alloy. In order to provide sufficient flux, this layer must be \"thick\" enough so that the flux can flow along the layer of soft magnetic material without magnetic saturation. Secondly, a similar problem applies to the secondary device that has to pick up to flux (and energy) on the upper surface of the charging platform. [0005] Fig.1B shows the device required for the charg- ing platform of Fig.1A. This consists of a magnetic core 3 and a winding. In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area (shaded in Fig.1B). Therefore, this cross-sectional area must be large enough so that enough flux and energy can be picked up by the secondary device. It should be noted that this secondary device must be housed inside the electronic equipment to be charged on the charging platform. The thickness of the secondary device is crucial to the applicability and practicality of the device. If it is too thick, it simply cannot be housed in the electronic equipment.
