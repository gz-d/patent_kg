In some embodiments, the apparatus 500A may be connected across a pair bus-bars (terminal+ and terminal-) on front side and back sides of a generic crystalline PV cell as shown in to FIG. 9.\n\nReferring back to FIG. 8, an apparatus 500B according to the present invention may be connected in parallel with a bypass diode as well as a substring of PV cells. In some embodiments, the apparatus 500B and the bypass diode may be connected in parallel to form a junction box module as shown in FIG. 10, which is to be installed in parallel with the substring of PV cells. The junction box may be placed on the back side of the PV module.\n\nReferring back to FIG. 8, an apparatus 500C according resent invention may be connected across a PV module uding two or more substrings of PV cells.\n\nto\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nWhat is claimed is:\n\n1. An apparatus for facilitating a photovoltaic device to provide a wireless communication channel, comprising:\n\na\n\nswitch connected in parallel with the photovoltaic device and configured for driving the photovoltaic device to produce optical signals carrying sensed data to be transmitted; and\n\ncontrol module connected with the switch and config- ured for receiving electrical sensing signals and gen- erate a control signal to control the switch.\n\na\n\n2. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein:\n\nwhen the control signal has a high-level value represent- ing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d, the switch is controlled to be at a close state for conducting current; and\n\nwhen the control signal has a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d, the switch is controlled to be an open state for blocking current.", "type": "Document"}}
