The released peptides can then terminate the incoming microorganisms. This de- fense mechanism is comparatively long lasting and more stable than the conventional approaches. This combined mechanism can be applied to various medical implants made of metals, alloys, ceramics, polymers, composites and hybrid materials, and even the medical implants with irregular shapes. [0022] In accordance with embodiments, implantable Ti alloys are provided with controllable antimicrobial and biocompatible properties for reducing post-operative im- plant-related bacterial infections. Certain embodiments having these controllable properties can resist infections both short term and long term (6 months or more) post- operatively. [0023] It should be noted that when the substrate ma- terial and/or location of application are altered, an option- al optimization of the sources and/or parameters of the surface techniques can be performed. For instance, an optimization of the plasma source, application frequency, voltage and duration of implantation can be involved when applying the PIII&D technique. Furthermore, the antimicrobial ability of implantable titanium alloy may in- volve an optimization of the sources and/or parameters of PIII&D, e.g. plasma source, application frequency, voltage, and duration of implantation. The parameters of the PIII&D include using a plasma source of at least one of water, oxygen, ammonia, fluorine, nitrogen, gold, sil- ver, copper, silicon-carbine, iridium oxide, carbon, and diamond like carbon; an implantation voltage in a range of 1kV - 100kV; a frequency in a range of 1 Hz - 1,000Hz; and a period of time in a range of 1 min - 100 hours.
