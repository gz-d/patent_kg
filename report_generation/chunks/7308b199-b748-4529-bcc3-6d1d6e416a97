The ring body includes a top insulating layer, a bottom insulating layer, and an interme- diate insulating layer disposed in between the top and the bottom insulating layers. The detector includes a receiving electrode layer disposed in between the top and the inter- mediate insulating layers, a transmitting electrode layer disposed in between the intermediate and the bottom insu- lating layers, and a ground electrode layer embedding in the bottom insulating layer and electrically coupled to an elec- trical ground. The receiving electrode layer has a plurality of receiving electrode portions separated from each other, and the receiving electrode portions thereof are arranged in a matrix and along a curve path. The interactive wearable\n\nIn accordance with another embodiment, the ring body is configured to wear on the first finger, such that the receiving electrode portions of the receiving electrode layer are arranged around the first finger along the curved path during the movement event.\n\nIn accordance with a second aspect of the present inven- tion, a machine learning (ML) based training method to train a wearable device for recognizing one or more known microgestures by two different fingers includes the follow- ing steps.\n\n15\n\nStep 1: One or more microgesture training data sets in response to the known one or more microgestures is mea- sured by a plurality of separated receiving electrode portions of the wearable device arranged in a matrix and along a curve path.\n\nStep 2: a channel-wise gradient operation is performed, a processor of the wearable device, on each of microgesture training data sets, so as to extract a channel- wise gradient feature set in response to the corresponding known microgesture.\n\nby\n\n25", "type": "Document"}}
