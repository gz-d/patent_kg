As shown in FIG. 2G, when the hydrophobic nanofibers face up, the liquid-solid-gas three-phase contact line (TCL) will go lower toward an equilibrium position after dipping water and form the convex surface between the hydrophobic fibers as the initiating surface. The convex surface is then sub- jected to an upward force (AP) calculated by the following 2\n\nEq.\n\n2ysin [Oy \u2014 @) Ap=2= - R r+2Rol\u2014siny)\n\nv\n\nwhere r is the pore diameter between the hydrophobic fibers, is the local geometrical angle, and Ro is the fiber radius. AP corresponds to the value of FH when TCL reaches equilibrium state.\n\nan\n\n[0092]\n\nThe TCL goes lower with the increase in F,,, and\n\nthe vertical distance h between the bottom of the hydropho- bic nanofibers and the convex apex increases. The distance between hydrophobic and superhydrophilic nanofibers is H. To achieve directional water transfer, h=H must be satisfied so that the liquid can reach the superhydrophilic fibers. Then, the reverse hydrophobic force (F,) and strong Fe of hydrophilic layer can induce the push-pull effect to drag the liquid to the pores of the hydrophilic nanofibers. Neverthe- less, when the thickness of hydrophobic nanofibers increases, AP will increase because of the decreased r value by mutual stacking of nanofibers; hence. h will decrease accordingly. The h will be much smaller than H in this case, so directional water transport cannot be implemented. When the hydrophilic layer is on top (FIG. 2H), water droplets will not drip down from under the hydrophobic fibers, because the air can be regarded as absolutely superhydrophobic and h is infinitely less than H. Herein, the directional moisture- wicking multilayered nanofibers membrane can meet the\n\nfollowing four requirements:", "type": "Document"}}
