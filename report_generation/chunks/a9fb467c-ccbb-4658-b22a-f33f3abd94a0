These components comprise important parts many wireless systems and devices, although their uses are confined to wireless applications.\n\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\n\nAn object of the invention is to provide a circuit including transparent resonator component mounted in the circuit to occupy at least a part of or the same footprint as another component of the circuit whilst allowing light impinging the resonator component to reach said another component.\n\na resonator (DR) can as a circuit element in oscillator and filter circuits, or as an effective radiator that is now commonly known as a DR antenna (DRA). In the past two decades, the DRA has been studied extensively due to a number of advantages it provides suchas its small size, low loss, low cost, light weight, and ease of excitation. DRAs are miniaturized antennas of ceramics or other dielectric media for microwave frequencies. DRAs are fabricated entirely from low loss dielectric materials and are typically mounted on ground planes. Their radiation charac- teristics are a function of the mode of operation excited in the DRA. The mode is generally chosen based upon operational requirements. DRAs offer several advantages over other antennas, such as small size, high radiation efficiency, and. simplified coupling schemes for various transmission lines. The bandwidth can be controlled over a wide range by the choice of dielectric constant, and the geometric parameters of", "type": "Document"}}
