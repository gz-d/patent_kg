The filter-antenna 20 1s operably connected with a signal (e.g., energy) source 10 such as a power amplifier to receive a signal (e.g., energy) from the signal source 10. The filter-antenna 20 includes a bandpass channel 22BP and a band-stop channel 22BS. The bandpass channel 22BP is connected with an antenna element 24. The band-stop channel 22BS is connected with a filter element 26 illustrated as a resistor. The energy in the passband received at the bandpass channel 22BP is transmitted to the antenna element 24; the energy in the stopband received at the band-stop channel 22BS is absorbed or dissipated by the resistor 26.
