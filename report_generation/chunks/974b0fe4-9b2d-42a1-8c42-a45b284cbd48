Each of SDGD component 212 and SDGD component 214 (e.g., each upper gate drive) can include three driving stages. For example, the SDGD com- ponent 212, which is associated with switch 202, can com- prise, for example, transistor Q, and transistor Q;, switch Ms and switch Mg, and transistor Q, and transistor Q,, which can form the three driving stages. Transistors Qa and Q, can be employed for signal amplifying and providing a charging path for the power supplies of the driving circuit of switch 204 (M.,), switches Ms and Me can form an inverter, and transis- tors Q, and Q;, which can be associated with resistor Rs (e.g., 10.02), can be employed for desirably fast driving of the switch 202 (e.g., power MOSFET M1). Similarly, the SDGD component 214, which is associated with switch 204, can comprise, for example, transistor Q, and transistor Qs, switch M, and switch Ma, and transistor Q, and transistor Qio, which can form the three driving stages. Transistors Q, and Q, can be employed for signal amplifying and providing acharging path for the power supplies of the driving circuit of switch 202 (M,), switches M7 and Mg, which can be respec-\n\nand\n\nas\n\nis\n\nsystem In accordance with an embodiment, with regard to the\n\ntively connected to R, (e.g., 5.1 kQ) and Ra (e.g., 5.1 kQ), can form an inverter, and transistors Q, and Qio, which can be\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nfor\n\nIn an aspect, capacitors Ci and C, can be charged up as the\n\nstate (e.g., steady state operation).\n\nReferring briefly to FIGS. 3A through 3I (along with FIG.", "type": "Document"}}
