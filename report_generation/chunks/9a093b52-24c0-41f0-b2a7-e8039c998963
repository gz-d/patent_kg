It is stronger than its cross-polar counterpart by more than 22 dB. The measured H-plane radiation pattern (yz-plane, \u00a2 = 90\u00b0) is not symmetric although the filter-antenna 400 is symmetric about the xz-plane. This may be caused by experimental imperfections including assembly errors. It was found that the radiation patterns are stable over the targeted ISM band (5.725\u20145.875 GHz) (results not illustrated).\n\nFigure 7 shows the measured and simulated realized antenna gains in the boresight direction (9 = 0\u00b0). With reference to Figure 7, the measured and simulated results are in good agreement. The measured maximum realized gain is 7.28 dBi at 5.8 GHz, which is 0.78 dB lower than the simulated peak gain (8.06 dBi) at 5.94 GHz due to experimental tolerances. The measured realized antenna gain is higher than 7 dBi from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a measured 1-dB gain bandwidth (gain > 6.28 dBi) of 5.86% (5.63\u2014-5.97 GHz). In the upper stopband, two measured radiation nulls with low antenna gains of around -23.5 dBi, along with a sharp roll-off rate for the upper band-edge, are observed. The measured out-of-band suppression level is more than 20.5 dB in the upper stopband (6.12\u20146.50 GHz). In the lower stopband (5.00-\u20145.44 GHz), another two radiation nulls are measured at 5.41 GHz and below 5.0 GHz, respectively, leading to a suppression level of more than 17.4 dB. The antenna gain of the reference antenna is also shown in the same figure to highlight the filtering characteristic of the filter-antenna 400 of the above embodiment.", "type": "Document"}}
