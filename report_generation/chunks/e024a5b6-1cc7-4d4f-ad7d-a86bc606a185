It can be applied to text input, mobile interaction, drone controlling, Internet of Things (IoT), and AR/VR interaction. Thumb gesturing on an index-finger pad is akin to operating a touchable surface (e.g., touch screen) with an index finger. Compared with performing gestures in suspension or on other large surfaces, T2] microgesture interaction could potentially support more simple and pri- vacy-preserving wearer-machine interactions with less physical demand.\n\nAttracting increasing research interest in recent years, detecting T2I microgestures is considered to be a challeng- ing problem due to the small range and the occlusion problem associated with thumb motions. Recent researches have proposed to use different sensors and recognition methods to support such type of wearer inputs, including millimeter-wave radar, front-facing passive infrared (PIR) sensors, RGB Camera, on-thumb motion sensors, magnetic sensors, and touch-sensitive foils.\n\nHowever, some of these existing detectors for detecting T2I microgestures are not suitable for wearers due to their large size and/or insufficient accuracy. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new detector to address the aforesaid issues.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:\n\nIt is an objective of the present invention to provide an interactive wearable device for recognizing and analyzing a movement event caused by two or more fingers of a wearer of the interactive wearable device, and machine learning (ML) based methods to train the interactive wearable device.", "type": "Document"}}
