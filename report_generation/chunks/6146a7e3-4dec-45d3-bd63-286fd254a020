It is known that factors such as nucleus extraction procedures, the cell viability and the surrounding conditions may alter nuclear properties. For comparison purposes, an experiment is con- ducted to quantify elastic modulus of chemically extracted. nuclei of NP460 and NPC43 cells using the microfluidic channel 502. The experimental procedures are similar to the method for quantifying mechanical properties of whole cells, except that only one driving pressure level is applied. As the extracted nuclei are smaller than the whole cells in size, the applied pressure level is set at 300 Pa to deform the extracted nuclei. The nuclear moduli are then calculated directly using Equation (4) above. The elastic modulus values of the extracted nuclei are 4.25+SE 0.31 kPa (N=30) for NP460 cell and 3.34+SE 0.15 kPa (N=40) for NPC43\n\nof\n\ncell.\n\n[0095] FIG. 5E illustrates a bar graph showing the values of nuclear moduli E,,,,.ze2- obtained based on parameters of the chemically extracted nuclei and the values of nuclear moduli E,,,,ciear obtained based on parameters of the whole cells (unextracted nuclei).

Such difference implicates that the nuclear properties may be altered by the chemical nucleus extraction procedures.", "type": "Document"}}
