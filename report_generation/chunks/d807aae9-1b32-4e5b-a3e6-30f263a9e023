The method comprises determining a value ofa parallel parasitic effect associated with a capacitor in the electronic circuit, sensing a voltage signal across the capaci- tor, determining from the sensed voltage signal and the value of the parallel parasitic effect a parasitic voltage associated. with the capacitor, and adding a voltage source in series with the capacitor, the voltage source being adapted to deliver a compensating voltage of generally equal magnitude but gen- erally opposite phase to the determined parasitic voltage.\n\nFIG. 154 is a graph of the ac component of the steady-state inductor current and output voltage waveforms of the buck converter with the active cancellation technique of the inven-\n\nFIG. 16a is a graph of the ac component of the transient inductor current and output voltage waveforms of the buc! converter without the active cancellation technique of the invention; and\n\nFIG. 166 is a graph of the ac component of the transient inductor current and output voltage waveforms of the buc! converter with the active cancellation technique of the inven- tion.", "type": "Document"}}
