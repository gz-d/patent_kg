Then 3 mL 30% H,Q, is added to reflux for 4 h. Cool the solution to room temperature, using HCI to adjust the pH to 2.0. Extract the crude compound by 100 mL ethyl acetate, and purify the compound by silica column, eluent by petroleum ether/ethyl acetate. Remove the solvent, compound 2 is collected as a pink power (yield: 65%, purity: 97%).\n\n[0110] FIG. 4 shows a 'H NMR analysis of compound DMSO-d6.
