For instance, switch 2002 can include body diode 2034, switch 2004 can include body diode 2036, switch 2006 can include body diode 2038, switch 2008 can include body diode 2040, switch 2010 can include body diode 2042, and switch 2012 can include body diode 2044, wherein the arrangement of the switches 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012, and thus, the body diodes 2034, 2036, 2038, 2040, 2042, and 2044 in the circuit can be such that the body diodes 2034, 2036, 2038, 2040, 2042, and 2044 can be structured and can inherently function as a bridge- rectifier including during initial start-up of the SDSR (e.g., prior to the rectified DC voltage providing at least a portion of the desired power to the switches of the SDSR). That is, the six body diodes 2034, 2036, 2038, 2040, 2042, and 2044 of the six switches 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 can form a three-phase diode rectifier when all the switches 2002", "type": "Document"}}
