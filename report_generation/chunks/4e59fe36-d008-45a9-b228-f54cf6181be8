The structured data, textual data, and image data used in Treatment module 106 are received from data collection module 104. The data in data pre-processing element 111 includes, but is not limited to, stroke patients\u2019 demographics, diagnosis, family medical history, laboratory results, CT / MRI images, drug use, and medical procedures, all of which are then used as input in the reinforcement learning model 115. The demographics data may contain gender, age, weight, and height etc. The family medical history data may contain indications of new symptoms or illnesses in a family through mapping of ICPC Codes or other standard codes such as ICD-9 code. The laboratory result data includes the results from chemical pathology test, haematology test, immunology test, microbiology, test and virology test.

The CT Brain for brain\n\nplain are in the format of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and may contain computed and compressed tomography images, wherein the image compression may be made under a lossy-compression ratio, which means that the quality of the images may be affected. The drug use and medical procedures should provide the item code defined by government or hospital, drug name, dosage, and strength of the item for the drug. Also, dispensing date, duration, and the route form of the drug intake by the patient should also be included in the data of the data pre-\n\nprocessing element 111.\n\n10\n\n15", "type": "Document"}}
