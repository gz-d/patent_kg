The electronic device can comprise any known type of device that employs a voltage regulator, but is preferably embodied in a mobile communi- cations device, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant or the like.\n\nWhilst many of the examples hereinbefore described relate to voltage regulators, it will be understood, as illustrated by the current regulator example of FIG. 4, that the various circuit arrangements of the examples depicting voltage regu- lators are equally applicable to current regulators and thus such examples are considered as also comprising current regulators replacing said voltage regulators.", "type": "Document"}}
