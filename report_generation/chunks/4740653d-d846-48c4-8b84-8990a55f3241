Consequently, the transistor Qa can be turned to an on state, and the transistor Q; can be turned to an off state. The voltage vacs can begin to increase from a zero voltage level. At or near the end of this time interval (e.g., time period of t, to time t,), the voltage vacs can reach (e.g., increase to) the predefined gate threshold switching voltage of the switch Mg.", "type": "Document"}}
