To counter this potential problem, the subject speci- fication (e.g., system 2100, system 2100) can include a zero- crossing controller component to that can facilitate desired switching of an associated power switch at zero-crossing points.\n\nReferring to FIG. 25G, depicted is operation of the system 2500 (and the system 2100 in FIG. 21) during the time period. of time t, to t,. At or near time t,, the voltage vascio can drop down below the applicable predefined gate threshold switch- ing voltage of the switch Mio, and, as a result, the switch Mio can be turned from an on state to an off state, and voltage Vecio can continue to decrease. The time period of time ts to t, can end when voltage vz-)9 reaches zero voltage.", "type": "Document"}}
