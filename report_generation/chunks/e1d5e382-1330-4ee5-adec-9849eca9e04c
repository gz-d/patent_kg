The anchor member is capable of joining a portion of the support member with the spine. For example, upon the completion of spinal correction surgery, the anchor member can mount the support member onto the deformed spine portion to lock the support member in place. Exemplary anchor members can include, but not limited to, hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the anchor member can be partially formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, such as NiTi, or other materials with similar prop- erties.\n\nIn one embodiment, the correction device can comprise one or more support members in various forms. For example, the support member can comprise one or more supporting rods of various shapes depending on the sagittal profile of the spine. In one exemplary embodiment, the supporting rod can be contoured to assume the normal degrees of spine kyphosis and lordosis. In another exemplary embodiment, the support- ing rod can have such a length to span across the deformed. spine portion. In a further exemplary embodiment, the sup- porting rod can have various cross-sections. For example, the supporting rod can have circular, oval, square, hexagonal, or other shapes or a combination thereof. It will be appreciated that other forms of the supporting rod and the support member are also within the scope of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
