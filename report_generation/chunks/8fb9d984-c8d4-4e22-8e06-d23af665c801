The anchor members 30 can be in various forms. For example, various bone anchors can be used to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine por- tion 4. Exemplary anchor members 30 can include, but are not limited to, wires, threads, hooks, screws, clamps and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more anchor members 30 used can be the same as the securing elements 20 discussed above. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more anchor members 30 can be in the form ofa transverse traction member 32 (see FIG. 2). Such transverse traction member 32 is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant force for correcting various spinal deformities as will be discussed in detail below.\n\nVarious embodiments of the correction device and the cor- rection method will be described in great detail below.\n\nFIGS. 1a and 14 show a first embodiment of the correction device 1 for correcting various spinal deformities, such as scoliosis.
