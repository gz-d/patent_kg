The two substrate layers 104A, 104B have the same thickness of t, radius o R,, and dielectric constant \u00a2,,. A feeding network 106, formed by metals (e.g., copper), in the form of patches/ strips, is arranged between the first substrate layer 104A and the dielectric resonator element 102. As will be described in further detail below, the feeding network 106 is arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element 102 to produce (or receive), selectively or simultaneously, a first linearly-po- larized omnidirectional radiation pattern at a first resonant mode and a second linearly-polarized omnidirectional radia- tion pattern. The first and second radiation patterns are generally the same but the polarizations are different (or- thogonal to each other); the first and second resonant modes are different. In this example, the first resonant mode is TM,,5 mode and the second resonant mode is TE,,5,;\n\naspect there is provided a wireless communication device including the antenna of the first aspect. The communication device may be a satellite communication device, a Wi-Fi commu- nication device (e.g., Wi-Fi router), etc.\n\n[0027] In accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a wireless communication device including the antenna of the second aspect. The communication device may be a satellite communication device, a Wi-Fi commu- nication device (e.g., Wi-Fi router), etc.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0028] Embodiments of the invention will now described, by way of example, with reference to the accom- drawings in which:\n\n[0029] FIG. 1A is a perspective view of a dielectric resonator antenna in one embodiment of the invention;", "type": "Document"}}
