The resistors, RA and RB, and capaci- tors, CA and CB, are connected to the error amplifier pro- ided by pins 15 and 16 to form a Type-II feedback network. he values of the components are designed, for example, by ollowing the method described in \u201cDoug Mattingly, \u201cDesigning Stable Compensation Networks for Single Phase Voltage Mode Buck Regulators,\u201d /ntersil Technical Brief TB 417.1, December 2003,\u201d incorporated herein by reference. is\n\nFIGS. 11 through to 14 demonstrate the ability of the present invention to at least provide a compensator circuit for a voltage regulator having: means for sensing an output volt- age signal at a passive component at an output of the voltage regulator; means for generating a compensating signal based on a difference signal, said difference signal comprising a difference between a level ofa reference voltage signal for the voltage regulator and the sensed output voltage signal; and means for applying said compensating signal to said passive output component to reduce said difference between the level of the reference voltage signal and the sensed output voltage signal.\n\nThe output voltage Vo of the regulator is connected to pin 1\u2014the non-inverting input of the error amplifier (1). The error amplifier compares Vo with the voltage reference Vref and generates the error signal output at pin 3. After subse- quent operation of pulsewidth modulation inside the control- Jer, the controller will give the gate signal to pins 8 and 11, i.e., C1 and C2, for driving the transistor T, so that Vo will be regulated to Vref.", "type": "Document"}}
