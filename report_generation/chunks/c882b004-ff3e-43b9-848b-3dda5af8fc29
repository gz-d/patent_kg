For a dose response study in tier 2, the range of concentrations to be tested covers from the lowest at which no adverse effect is observed to the highest concentration at which all embryos are killed.\n\nAfter staining for 12 minutes, all the blood vessels in the fish embryo are labeled. The staining reaction is stopped by wash- ing three times in PBT and embryos are fixed in 4% paraform- aldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes. The embryos are then washed briefly in PBT twice and 10 minutes 4 times. After washing, embryos should be immersed in 70% glycerol in PBS before examination and image capturing on a CCD camera.", "type": "Document"}}
