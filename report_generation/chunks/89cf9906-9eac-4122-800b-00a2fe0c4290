Further, the cap includes an integrally formed secondary winding to surround the body portion when present, the secondary winding being adapted to receive magnetic flux extending from a planar charging surface when present, and a layer of magnetic material situ- ated such that when the cap is removably fitted over the body portion, the layer of magnetic material is disposed between the secondary winding and the body portion of the electrical device for reducing current induced in the body of the elec- trical device. The cap is configured for placing in contact with the planar charging surface when present and to support the electrical device on the planar charging surface during charg- ing of the electrical device, and the secondary winding is arranged to be substantially parallel to the planar charging surface when present so that lines of magnetic flux extending from the planar charging surface pass substantially perpen- dicularly through the secondary winding during charging of\n\nFIG. 2 shows a variation of the example of FIG. 1, but where the secondary winding 12 comprises at least one coil, and preferably multiple, that is provided in a cap 6 that may be used to cover and protect the head portion 13 of the flashlight. Insucha case, the secondary winding 12 may be connected to the rechargeable battery using a charging cable (not shown), which may be fixed if the cap 6 is designed to be permanently attached to the flashlight 1, or may plug into the flashlight body 14 to connect to a charging circuit ifthe cap is designed. to be removed completely from the flashlight.\n\n45\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:", "type": "Document"}}
