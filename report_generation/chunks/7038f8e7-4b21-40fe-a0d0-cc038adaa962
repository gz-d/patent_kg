The capacitor 118 is positioned at an output of the voltage regulator 110 in series with a voltage source 124 of the compensator circuit 122. The capacitor 118 is arranged in parallel with a load impedance \u201cZ, 120 of the voltage regulator. Together with an inductor 119, the capacitor 118 forms an LC filter circuit at the output of the voltage regulator 110. The capacitor 118 is used to help keep the voltage regulator\u2019s output voltage v, generally con- stant over time, although an output ripple will usually still be\n\ntor\n\nals regulator\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n60\n\n65\n\nalready employed to\n\nvoltage regulator\n\nUS 8,169,201 B2\n\n13\n\n14\n\ncontroller V load current i, and compensator output V\n\nexample of the invention depicted by FIGS. 2, 5, 6, 8 and 10\n\ncomp\n\nwith and without the compensator.\n\nwill be used to denote like parts.\n\nIn FIG. 12 shows a steady state waveform at heavy load\n\nThe compensator circuit 122 of FIG. 11e has been applied\n\nusing a timebase of 20 us with V-10 mV/div, V-2V/div,\n\nto a known 7W voltage-mode buck regulator as shown in\n\nv=50 mV/div and i. 2 A/div.
