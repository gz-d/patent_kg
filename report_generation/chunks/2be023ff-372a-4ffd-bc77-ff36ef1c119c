It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, however, that the invention could equally be applied to other types of electrical devices. One other example of a device to which the invention could be applied is a camera with the secondary coil being integrated into the lens or into a lens cap, the camera could then be charged by placing the lens or lens cap (coupled to the battery in some manner) on the charging surface.\n\nflux that extend generally perpendicular to the planar charg- surface is disposed beneath the planar charging surface.\n\n4.

Without necessarily being limited thereto, the invention is particularly suitable for use with devices having at least a part that is formed of a generally circular cross-section (such as the head portion of a flashlight or the lens of a camera) such that the secondary winding can easily be formed as part of the circular cross- section (or a cap or protective device that is adapted to cover that circular portion), and where the device may then easily be charged by standing the device on the charging surface by means of the circular portion. The invention could also be applied, however, to electrical devices having portions with differently shaped cross-sections, such as for example square", "type": "Document"}}
