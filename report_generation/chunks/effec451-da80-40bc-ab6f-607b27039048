FIG. 5 shows the simulated and measured reflection coeffi- cients of the configuration. As can be observed from the figure, the measured and simulated resonant frequencies of the DRA 112 are 1.94 GHz and 1.89 GHz, respectively, with an error of 2.65%. The measured and simulated impedance bandwidths are given by 16.5% and 22.8%, respectively. Although the DR 116 in this case also has a displacement of 2 mm from the substrate as for the previous one with the airgap, its measured resonant frequency (1.94 GHz) is lower than that of the airgap case (2.26 GHz). This is because the solar cell 114 increases the effective dielectric constant of the DR 116. It is interesting to note that the measured resonant frequency (1.94 GHz) is quite close to that of the DRA (1.92 GHz) resting on the ground plane (g=0). With reference to the figure, a small resonant mode was measured at 2.25 GHz. This mode is caused by the solar cell, which can be verified by the fact that it was still observed when the rectangular DR was used. The simulated result does not predict this resonance mode, which is not surprising because the exact dielectric\n\nThe dual or multi-function transparent hemispherical DRA 112 made of Borosilicate Crown Glass simultaneously func- tions as a radiating element and an optical focusing lens. The DR 116 can also serve as a protective cover for its underlaid solar cell 114. Since the DR 116 is transparent, the light can ass through it and illuminate on the underlaid solar cell. Because of the focusing effect of the DR 116, the voltage and current outputs of the solar cell can be increased. The system", "type": "Document"}}
