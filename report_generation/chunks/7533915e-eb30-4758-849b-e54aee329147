The encapsulation layer may be disposed over the thermoelectric modules (i.e. over the semiconductor ele- ments and conductor members). The encapsulation layer may encapsulate the device 100 or device 200. In one example the encapsulation layer may comprise a thin layer of polyimide that surrounds the substrate, the thermoelectric modules, electrodes and bridging members. The encapsula- tion layer provides protection to the devices 100 and 200 from environmental damage.\n\n[0162] The thermoelectric device 100, 200 is also advan- tageous because the thermoelectric generator 100, 200 power output capacity is not limited. The device 100, 200 is advantageous because the devices continuously harvests waste heat. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 as described provides a flexible, potable and wearable device that gen- erates electrical current and electrical power. The device 100, 200 provides a longer lifespan than batteries because the device simply harvests body heat rather than generating power due to chemical processes.", "type": "Document"}}
