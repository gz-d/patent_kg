The porous layer may act as a support or a substrate allowing the receptors to accommodate thereon. The porous layer may be of any size that allows it to be fitted into the solution chamber 102. Preferably, the porous layer may be a polymeric layer or a metallic layer with nanopores. The nanopores may be introduced to the polymeric layer or metallic layer by reported techniques such as track-etching, ion bean sculpting, electron beam sculpting and the like. Advantageously, with the presence of the nanopores, the porous layer provides a large surface area for accommodat- ing a large amount of receptors, which may increase the chance of the target substance being captured by the recep-\n\n[0045] In this embodiment, the electrochemical detector 100 may be used for detecting a cancer biomarker in a sample.
