Preferably, although not necessarily, the device 102 would operate with a plurality of other associated devices 102 to perform a certain task or goal. Such devices 102 may include any equipment, fixture, plant, vehicle or apparatus that may be arranged to operate, individually, partially or completely together to perform one or more tasks. Examples of such devices may include wind turbines in a wind farm, as illustrated in some of the example embodiments described below. Other devices, such as coal powered generators, nuclear power generators, trains, drill- ing/boring machines, transportation systems, signalling sys- tems, oil rigs, pumps, radar arrays, radio transmitters, lifts/ escalators, air conditioning systems, telecommunication equipment and exchanges, computer servers, may also oper- ate with examples of the systems for monitoring a device 100.\n\n[0043] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the device conditions gateway is a SCADA system.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0044] Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accom- panying drawings in which:\n\n[0045] FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a system for monitoring a device in accordance with one embodiment present invention;\n\n[0046] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example conditions monitoring engine as used in the system of FIG. 1;\n\n[0047] FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example device engine of the monitoring engine of FIG. 2;\n\n[0048] FIG. 4 is a data flow diagram of an example method for monitoring a device in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention;", "type": "Document"}}
