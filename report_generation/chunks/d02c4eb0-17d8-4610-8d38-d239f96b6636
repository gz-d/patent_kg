The processor component 622 can employ one or more processors, microprocessors, or controllers that can process data, such as signals (e.g., optical signals or patterns) relating to video content being presented by a projector screen component 600, video content, audio content, map- ping information relating the optical signals, type of video content and/or types/modes of barrier patterns, data relating to parameters associated with the projector screen component 600 and associated components, etc., to facilitate presenting or identifying a desired signal to transmit to the barrier control component in associated with video content being presented. The processor component 622 can control data flow between the projector screen component 600 and other components\n\nIn some embodiments, component 606 can operate in conjunction with a control region component 608 to present the signal to the barrier control component. The control region component 608 can include a control region and/or can be employed to create a control region in or on the projector screen 604 for presentation of the signal in relation to presentation of visual images being presented by the pro- jector screen 604, wherein the control region can have a specified size and shape, as desired. The control region com- ponent 608 can present the signal associated with a visual image(s) in the control region to facilitate presentation of the signal to the barrier control component when video content is the", "type": "Document"}}
