The compensator senses an output signal at a passive compo- nent at an output of the regulator; generates a compensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference being a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regu- lator and the sensed output signal; and applies the compen- sating signal to the passive output component to reduce the difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal. The passive output component may be, for example, a capacitor or an inductor, depending on the operation of the regulator.\n\n(52) .SC 323/268; 323/312", "type": "Document"}}
