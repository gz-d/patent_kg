In accordance with various embodiments, the illuminator com- ponent 618 can be a mechanical component, an electronic component, and/or a combination thereof.\n\nThe projector screen component 600 can contain a power supply component 620 that can employ an internal power supply to power the projector screen component 600 or can receive power from an external power supply to power the projector screen component 600. In some implementations, the power supply component 620 can receive power from the barrier control component, wherein the barrier control com- ponent can produce power using one or more solar cells that can generate power based at least in part on the light from detected optical signals associated with visual images and presented in the control region of the projector screen com-\n\nThe projector screen component 600 can include a control component 606 that can control the presentation of video and audio content, and further can control the presentation (e.g., transmission, emission) of a signal, such as an optical signal, to an associated barrier control component. At a given time when video content is being presented by the projector screen component 600, the signal can be one of a plurality of avail- able signals, wherein the signal can comprise information (e.g., specified optical pattern, bits of data having a specified data value) that can indicate, to the barrier control component, the type of video content, the desired type of barrier pattern and barrier pattern mode to be used in processing the video content for presentation to the viewer, and/or the desired control signal the barrier control component is to send to the barrier", "type": "Document"}}
