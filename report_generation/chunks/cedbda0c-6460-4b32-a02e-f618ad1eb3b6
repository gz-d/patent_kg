While the invention has been described with reference to a number of preferred embodiments it should be appreciated that the invention can be embodied in many other forms.\n\n[0131] The present disclosure relates to a thermoelectric device that converts heat i.e. thermal energy to electricity. Expressed another way the thermoelectric device generates electricity i.e. an electrical current when the thermoelectric device is exposed to a temperature gradient i.e. temperature difference. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a wearable thermoelectric device that can be worn by a user. The thermoelectric device described herein generates an electric current and due to an induced voltage when exposed to a heat source e.g. body heat.", "type": "Document"}}
