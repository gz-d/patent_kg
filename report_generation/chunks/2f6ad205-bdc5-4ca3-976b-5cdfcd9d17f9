Therefore, the fore- going statements of object are not exhaustive and serve merely to illustrate some of the many objects of the present invention. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will understand that the embodiments of the present invention as hereinafter described may address one, some or all of said objects, but may do so only to a limited degree. The statements of objects are defined merely by way of example and are not to be regarded as being requiring to be satisfied by each and every embodiment.\n\nparasitic comprises a inductive effect and a series resistive effect, the steps of deter- mining from said sensed voltage signal and said value of the series parasitic effect a parasitic voltage associated with said part of the electronic circuit or system and adding a voltage source in series with said part of the electronic circuit or system may comprise using a differentiator circuit to differ- entiate the sensed voltage signal to determine a first compen- sating voltage for the series inductive effect, using a multi- plier circuit to determine a second compensating voltage from the sensed voltage signal for the series resistive effect and using a single voltage driver circuit to generate a com- bined compensating voltage comprising said first and second\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided method and apparatus for suppressing or at least reducing the effect of the series parasitic inductance and resistance of an electrical component, particularly a capacitive network, or circuit, on the frequency response of the component and. circuit.", "type": "Document"}}
