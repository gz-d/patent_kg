The communication device 210 may be a modem, a Network Interface Card (NIC), an integrated network interface, a radio frequency transceiver, an optical port, an infrared port, a USB connection, or other wired or wireless communication interfaces. The communication links may be wired or wireless for communicating com- mands, instructions, information and/or data. Preferably, the processor 202, the memory unit 204, and optionally the input devices 206, the output devices 208, the communica- tion device 210 and the disk drives 212 are connected with each other through a bus (e.g., a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) such as PCI Express, a Universal Serial Bus (USB), an optical bus, or other like bus structure). In one embodiment, some of these components may be con- nected through a network such as the Internet or a cloud computing network. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that the audio processing system 200 shown in FIG. 7 is merely exemplary and different audio processing system 200 with different configurations may be applicable\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\na\n\n7.
