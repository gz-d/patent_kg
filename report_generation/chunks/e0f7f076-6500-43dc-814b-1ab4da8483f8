The step of assembling may include the following steps in sequential order: pressing the anode 32 against the spacer 30, placing and pressing the o-ring 26 onto the smaller case 24, placing the spring 28 on top and then the spacer 30 and anode 32 (with the anode 32 facing upwards), placing the separator 34 on top as centered as possible, dropping the electrolyte (e.g., about 100 pL to about 300 LL) onto the separator 34, placing the cathode 36 on top (with the cast film facing the anode 32), and placing the larger case 22\n\non top.\n\n[0061] Without intending to be limited by theory, the inventors have, through their own researches, trials, and experiments, devised that the COF as mentioned herein may be further used as an anode for the energy storage device, such as the sodium-ion battery or the lithium-ion battery as mentioned herein. The energy storage device may be in form of, for example, a coin/button cell, a coin pouch cell, a pouch cell, a cylindrical cell, prismatic cell and the like. In one embodiment, the energy storage device may be in form of a coin cell, such as a half coin cell or a full coin cell.\n\nTurning now again to FIG. 2, there is an example\n\n[0062]", "type": "Document"}}
