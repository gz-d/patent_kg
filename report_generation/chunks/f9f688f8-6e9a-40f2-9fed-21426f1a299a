Zebrafish in vivo bioassay combines the advan- tages of high throughput, as compared to mammalian in vivo assays, and high relevance, as compared to in vitro assays. Recently, two articles have been published demonstrating similar physiological responses of zebrafish to well-know compounds that induce cardiac arrhythmia in humans (Langheinrich et al. 2003; Milan et al. 2003). Furthermore, the ortholog of hERG was cloned and showed high simi- larity in protein sequence in the pore region and the cyclic- nucleotide binding region to which some cardiac toxic compounds bind (Langheinrich et al. 2003). In addition, mutation in ZERG exhibits similar phenotype of cardiac arrhythmia as in human. These results suggest zebrafish may be used as a model for screening compounds with cardiac\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\narrhythmia, a group heart beat is going too fast (tachyrhythmia), too slow or irregularly (bradyrhythmia), is a life-threatening medical emergency that causes cardiac arrest and sudden death (Kleber and Rudy. 2004). The common causes for both congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmia are genetic and chemical- or disease-induced perturbations of cardiac rhythm. Over 50 therapeutic compounds have shown the potential to induce unexpected cardiac arrhythmia and some of them were withdrawn from market. Cardiac arrhythmia is now considered a significant risk factor for predicting human safety of new therapeutic compounds. Therefore, drug regulatory authorities now have increased concerns regarding arrhythmic potential of therapeutic compounds and regulatory advice on evaluation of promoting arrhyth-", "type": "Document"}}
