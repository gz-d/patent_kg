The samples were prepared using a customized dumbbell mold (the narrow region is 5-mm wide and 2-mm thick). The separation rate during the tests was 500 mm/min. The strain at which fracture occurred (indicated by arrows) is defined as the elongation at break.\n\n[0055] FIG. 5C shows Young\u2019s modulus of the PDMS with various mixing ratios of Part A (prepolymer) to Part (crosslinker) in Phase I and II.\n\n[0056] FIG. 6A shows failure cases of true 3D molding resulted from the inobservance of CECE principle where the elastic cracks were totally out of control during casting when PDMS was directly enhanced to Phase II.\n\n[0057] FIG. 6B shows failure cases of true 3D molding resulted from the inobservance of CECE principle where thin membranes were observed in the otherwise closed loops replicated from PDMS mold in Phase I during molding, suggesting the unsealed elastic cracks without introducing Phase II.\n\nFIG. 7A shows geometry parameters of the model.\n\n[0072] Revealing New Elastic Material Physics\n\n[0059] FIG. 7B shows the condition for releasing PDMS mold during crack formation in Phase I.\n\n[0073] Whereas studies have shown that proper control of crack formation in rigid materials (e.g., hexagonal BN, SiN, and Si) can give rise to useful functionalities such as atomic-scale pattern formation, there generally lacks under- standing whether the formation and configuration of cracks\n\n[0060] FIG. 7C shows the condition for releasing the PDMS mold during configurable seal/open in Phase II.\n\n[0061] FIG. 8A shows experiments results for selected geometries covered in the prediction map in FIG. 2B.\n\nimage\n\nskin.\n\ntion.\n\non\n\ntion.\n\nan\n\nof\n\nwith\n\nat\n\nB\n\nthe\n\n[0058] lation\n\nsimu-\n\nthe\n\n[0062] geometries\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\ncrack\n\nfor\n\nyield\n\npoint.\n\nof\n\n[0071]", "type": "Document"}}
