A series of data points is obtained from each video frame from a part of the video or from the whole video. Power spectral analysis is then applied to analyze the series of data points, by which heart rate and quantitative parameter of heart beat rhythm are obtained. Our experimental results showed that the heart rate calculated by the present invention is equivalent to the heart rate determined by direct examination of heart. Fur- thermore, our results also showed that the quantitative parameter of heart beat rhythm, the cardiac rhythmicity index calculated by the present invention, is inversely cor- related with the regularity of heart beat rhythm.", "type": "Document"}}
