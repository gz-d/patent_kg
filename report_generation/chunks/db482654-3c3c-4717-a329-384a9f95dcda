The 2-D visual image(s) can be presented on the projector screen component. The signal embedded in the 2-D visual image(s) can be presented in the control region of the projector screen component. The sensor component can detect or sense the signal presented (e.g., emitted) in the control region of the projector screen component.\n\nsignal can be processed using the identified barrier pattern, in the identified barrier pattern mode, to generate processed video content comprising a generated or reconstructed 2-D or 3-D scene. For example, normal 2-D video content can be processed using a transparent barrier pattern (e.g., barrier pattern in transparent barrier pattern mode) that will pass the normal 2-D video content through without affecting or alter- ing the normal 2-D video content. As another example, enhanced 2-D video content, which can be used to reconstruct a 3-D scene, can be processed using an applicable 3-D type barrier pattern (e.g., barrier pattern for 3-D stereoscopic video content, barrier pattern for 3-D autostereoscopic video con- tent) while in the corresponding barrier pattern mode, as more fully disclosed herein, to generate or reconstruct 3-D video", "type": "Document"}}
