Similar to Metalens #1, a local coordinate reference system (L2) is also defined, whose origin Or> is located at the geometric center of Metalens #2. Again, the local coordinate system L2 is synchronous co-rotation of Metalens #2. Met- alens #2 has a reverse functionality of Metalens #1, ie., focusing the incident plane waves from Metalens #1 into a specific focal point as shown in FIG. 13(c). Metalens #2 has an identical diameter of 15 mm to that of Metalens #1 and has a focal length of f,=20 mm To concentrate the incident waves into the focal point, Metalens #2 should firstly compensate for the incident progressive phase distribution from Metalens #1 (phase conjugation to the incident waves as shown in FIG. 17(a)) and provide a quadratic phase distribution above the lens aperture (see FIG. 17(4)). Then the desired aperture phase distribution of Metalens #2 is the sum of progressive phase distribution and quadratic phase distribution (see FIG. 17(c)). The metasurface designed using this method is denoted as single-focus metalens since the designed Metalens #2 can only concentrate the incident waves into its focal point at the center. When the focus steers away from the center by synchronous counter rotation of the metalens pair, large phase errors occur on the lens aperture and the transmitted waves cannot be perfectly superposed in phase at the desired position of the focal point, resulting in\n\noff-axis aberration as shown in FIG. 13(e).", "type": "Document"}}
