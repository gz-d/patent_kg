All the insets in 2a-2d are the corresponding low-magnification images. 2e shows mapping of energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for Ni, Co and Mn in PGE-NCM811.\n\n[0010] FIG. 3a- are Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns for 3a pristine and 3b PGE-NCMB811 materials. The raw experimental data is shown with hollow circles. The calculated patterns are shown in lines.
