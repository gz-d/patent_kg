The integrated circuit may be included in a device. The device with the radiator may also include a thermal management device thermally coupled with the radiator for regulating temperature of the radiator (e.g., for facilitating heat dissipation from the radia- tor). For example, the thermal management device may be coupled to a side (e.g., back side) of the integrated circuit. For example, the thermal management device may include a passive thermal management device (e.g., heat sink with fins, pins, etc.) and/or an active thermal management device (e.g., a fan, a liquid-based heat exchange device, an evapo- rative heat exchanger, etc.). The device with the radiator may lack any lens disposed relative to the radiator for affecting (e.g., boosting) directivity of the terahertz electro- magnetic radiation provided by the radiator. The radiator, the integrated circuit, or the device may be included in a system for providing terahertz electromagnetic radiation. The sys-\n\ntem may be a sensing system, a communication system, a\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\netc. The\n\nspectroscopic system, an imaging system, system may be an active terahertz imaging system arranged to illuminate objects (e.g., targeted objects). The system may be a cellular (e.g., 5G, 6G, above 6G, or the like) commu- nication system.", "type": "Document"}}
