The presence of the gRNA and the\n\nmodified Cas9 protein provides suitable conditions for alter\n\nenable the direct conversion or editing of bases .\n\nIn a preferred embodiment , the modified protein with a\n\ning the target gene in that particular cell .\n\nmutation at the N413 position and at least one additional\n\nPreferably , the kit further comprises an inducible pro\n\nmutation at the R245 , N419 and / or R654 positions decrease 55 moter . The term \u201c inducible promoter \u201d as used herein refers\n\nnuclease activity at one or more sites on a target DNA to a chemical or molecule that can control gene expression\n\nmolecule . In a preferred embodiment , the sites are off - target\n\nof a particular gene , in particular inducing a target gene to\n\nsites . Preferably , the mutation changes the wild - type amino\n\nexpress in a system . The inducible promoter may include a\n\ntetracycline including tetracycline - type antibiotic or its\n\nacid to alanine .\n\nThe modified SaCas9 protein of the present invention is 60 derivative which is capable of inducing the expression of a\n\nderived from an isolated SaCas9 protein . The isolated\n\ntarget gene .\n\nSaCas9 protein may be commercially available or artificially\n\nIt would be appreciated that the kit may further comprise\n\nsynthesized .
