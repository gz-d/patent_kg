During the start-up stage, the capacitors C,, Cs and C,, which can be respectively associated with resistors R,, Ry and R,, for use by capacitors C,, Cs and Ca, can be designed to be charged up more quickly than the capacitors C,, C, and Cy, until the capacitors C,, C; and Cs respectively reach a predefined voltage, wherein the predefined voltage can be determined based at least in part on the respective zener diodes Dz,, Dz, and Dz,. Instill another aspect, bipolar transistors Q,, Qs, and Qis can be used to facilitate ensuring the capacitors C3, C, and Cy will not be charged (e.g., fully charged to a predefined voltage level) before a time that the capacitors C,, C, and C, have been charged up to a voltage level that is higher than the voltage level of the capacitors C3, C,andC,. As a result, the power switches, switch 2102 (M,), switch 2104 (M,), and switch 2106 (M,), will not switch before the driving logic of the SDGD subsystem has been initialized and set up to operate at a desired steady-state", "type": "Document"}}
