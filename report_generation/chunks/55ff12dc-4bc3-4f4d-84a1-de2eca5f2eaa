The composition of LiNiO, was employed, and the struc- tural parameters of the original R-3m and distorted C2/m cells utilized the results from the experimental PDF refine- ments (Table 2). The calculated partial density of states (PDOS, FIG. 14) shows a strong hybridization between the O-2p and Ni-3d states in the valance band (VB), and the octahedral crystal field splits the VB into two characters (be and e,). For the typical R-3m cell, the half-filled e band lying on the Fermi level implies conducting behavior. Inter- estingly, when the octahedra are elongated, both spin-up and spin-down electrons may contribute to the conduction through jumping into the holes. This means the distorted monoclinic grain surfaces in PGE-NCM811 provide a higher concentration of donors that facilitate the electronic transfer. In other word, the three-dimensional boundaries spreading over the secondary particles could act as a con- ducting network, which accounts for the high rate capability\n\nof the PGE-NCM811 material.\n\n[0056] The enhanced cycling performance could be explained by the structural stability of the monoclinic grain surfaces during charge-discharge process, which constrains the internal grain lattice from cyclic structural changes. For the pristine material, the interlayer distance along c-axis is governed by the O\u2014O repulsion. Upon deep delithiation, especially, this O\u2014O repulsion could be weakened by the charge compensation between the highly hybridized Ni-3d and O-2p states, leading to the abrupt contraction of the interlayer distance during the H2-H3 transition. In the case of PGE-NCM81], the Jahn-Teller distortion of the octahedra\n\nApr. 14, 2022", "type": "Document"}}
