Referring to FIG. 3A, illustrated is operation of the system 300 (and the system 200 and FIG. 2) during a time prior to time t,. With regard to system 300, the respective voltages, vaca and Vgce; can represent the base-collector voltages of the transistors Q, and Q, (e.g., bipolar junction transistors (BJT)), respectively. At a time before time t,, the input voltage signal, v,,,, can be at a higher voltage level than voltage V,. At this point in time, both the current directions in resistors R, (e.g., 1.3 MQ) and R; (e.g., 1.3 MQ) can be from left to right as illustrated in FIG. 3A. The voltage vscs can be clamped to zero voltage, or at least substantially close to a zero voltage, by a p-n junction between the collector and base of the transistor Q;. As a result, the switch Ms\u3002 (e.g., p-channel MOSFET) can be turned or switched to an on state and the switch Me (e.g., the n-channel MOSFET) can be turned or switched to an off state, and such condition can maintain the gate-source voltage of the switch 202 at high level, which can thereby turn or switch the switch 202 to an on state. Meanwhile, with regard to the SDGD component 214, the current flowing through the resis- tor R, can flow through the p-n junction between the base and collector of the transistor Q,, which can clamp the voltage Vacs to voltage V,. As a result, the switch M, can be turned or switched to an off state and the switch Mg can be turned or switched maintain the of", "type": "Document"}}
