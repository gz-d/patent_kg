Then, the measured radiated power of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array is calculated and shown in FIG. 23A. The peak radiated power is 9.1 dBm at 674.9 GHz. The simulated and measured power consumption of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array is shown in\n\n[0207] Some embodiments of the invention have provided a large-scale coherent terahertz (THz) source array with multiple coupled oscillator elements. Some embodiments of the invention have provided a 2D scalable coupling topology suitable for large array formation to enable the desired coherent oscillation mode, in which a differential patch antenna can be incorporated, radiating the third harmonic for\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nhigh output frequency beyond 600 GHz without requiring a lens. Some of the disclosure relates to the study on the nonlinear operation of a transistor for finding optimum operating state for boosting the third harmonic output. Some of the disclosure relates to design of the oscillator based on the determined optimum condition. In some embodiments of the invention, the input impedance of the antenna is matched to the optimum value for harmonic boost and high-efliciency harmonic power extraction from the transistor. The design in some embodiments of the invention is capable of beam steering by changing the bias voltage to establish different phase gradients across the array.", "type": "Document"}}
