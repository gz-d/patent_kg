In one exemplary embodiment, the restraining ele- ment can comprise one or more locking elements, such as lockable clamps, which are capable of preventing the support member from further movement. Additionally or alternatively, the restraining element can comprise a stopper element to prevent the support member from ro- tating beyond a pre-defined position. The restraining el- ement can be operated in various manners. In an exem- plary embodiment, the restraining element can be oper- ated by a direct access tool, such as a screw driver. In another exemplary embodiment, the restraining element can be operated by a remote access tool, such as an electromagnetic heating device. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the restraining element are also within the scope of the present invention. [0034] If desired, the correction device can be provided with additional components to reinforce, reduce, termi- nate, or otherwise adjust the correction force. For exam- ple, the correction device can further comprise one or more of the following components: (a) means for alter- nating the diameter of the support member to control re- covery force; (b) one or more internal motor, gear boxes, and the like; and (c) springs or coils or wires made from a superelastic material or other materials with similar properties. [0035] Various embodiments of the correction device will be described in great detail below. [0036] Figs. 1a and 1b show a first embodiment of the correction device 1 for correcting various spinal deform- ities, such as scoliosis. The correction device 1 can be in various forms and be mounted onto at least a portion of the spine 2. For example, the correction device 1 can be either applied to the vertebral body anteriorly or ap- plied to elements of the neural arch posteriorly. In one embodiment, the correction device 1 can comprise a sup- port member", "type": "Document"}}
