The porous layer may be modified with a layer of active material, which allows seeding a plurality of coupling agents thereon. The coupling agent may have one or more functional groups that can form at least one covalent bond with the receptors and the porous layer, thereby anchoring the receptors onto the porous layer. For example, the coupling agent may have at least one of a hydroxyl group, a sulfhydryl group, an amino group, a siloxane group or a carboxyl group forming at least one covalent bond with the receptors and the porous layer. Detailed structural arrangement of the substance selection structure will be discussed in later part of this disclosure.\n\n[0059] In this example, the porous layer 202 may be a polycarbonate (PC) membrane or an aluminium membrane with a plurality of nanopores. The membrane 202 may have a morphology as shown in FIG. 3A. As shown, the nanopo- res are distributed non-uniformly on a smooth membrane surface. The membrane 202 may have a thickness of about 7 hm and its pores may have a pore size of about 50 nm. It is appreciated that a skilled person may vary the thickness and pore size of the membrane according to their needs.\n\n[0052] In operation, the electrochemical detector 100 may be implemented as a solution chamber 102 including a first portion 102A and a second portion 102B. The first and the second portions may be detachably connecting with each other to form an enclosed chamber 102. The first and the second portions may be connected with each other by any suitable external means. For example, the two portions may be connected with each other by screwing them together with a plurality of screws.", "type": "Document"}}
