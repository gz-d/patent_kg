The reactor 10 includes plural chan- nels for solution (refrigerant/absorbent mixture), refrigerant, and heat source/sink liquids. The heat source/sink liquids, which may be hot water, conduction oil, cooling water, chilled water, antifreeze, etc. depending on the role of the fluid in different operation modes, flow through liquid channel 20 and liquid channel 30, respectively. The refrig- erant channel 40 is positioned adjacent to the solution channel 50 and is separated by a porous membrane 45 and optional hollow membrane support plate 47. Note that the depiction of the reactor 10 is schematic only; the cross- sections of the various channels may be arbitrarily selected to be square, rectangular, circular, curved, and other selected shapes.", "type": "Document"}}
