The SANs 10 are readily coated with a layer of densely packed Ag nanospheres 22, which are either uniform in size or at least has a very narrow size distribution.\n\n[0084] Embodiments of the present invention can applied to various applications and fields, for example:\n\n[0085] SERS substrates\n\n[0086] Embodiments of the present invention can be used to produce Ag needle with tailorable advanced nanostructures, making them attractive SERS sub- strates. Especially, such novel SERS substrate can be readily inserted into sample, facilitating sampling pro- cess, which is favorable for fast analysis.\n\n[0074] The treated needle 10 is then applied as an enhanced SERS substrate for trace analysis and detection of 4-nitrothiophenol (4-NTP), a commonly used Raman reporter/label. After soaking in 10-* M 4-NTP for 10 min- utes, Raman signals of 4-NTP absorbed at SAN from different spots on the substrate and the mapping images (2 um stepwise) were recorded, showing excellent reproduc- ibility (FIG. 4). The detection limit was found to be as low as 10-* M. Thus, the present method exhibited a detection limit five orders of magnitude lower and shows enhanced Raman signals with a much improved reproducibility/re- peatability (SD<15%) for trace detection of 4-NTP over untreated ones. Thus, the SERS substrate is conspicuously superior to the common commercial SERS substrates.\n\n[0087] Industrial Catalyst", "type": "Document"}}
