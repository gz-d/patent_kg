This is denoted as \u201cmulti-view video plus depth (MVD)\u201d. In these cases, the depth video file (or reference depth video file) is part of the 3D video file.\n\n[0006] In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer-implemented method for deter- mining a quality of a synthesized video file. The method including: processing a reference video file and a synthe- sized video file associated with the reference video file to compare the reference video file and the synthesized video file; and determining an extent of flicker distortion of the synthesized video file based on the processing. The synthe- sized video file may be a 3D video file containing 3D video data, or it may be a virtual reality video file containing virtual reality video data.", "type": "Document"}}
