In the following description, like numerals to those already employed to describe the first example of the voltage regulator of FIGS. 2 and 5 will be used to denote like arts.\n\nThe output voltage signal summing point 130 shown in FIG. 5 is realized by connecting a voltage signal sourcey 124 in series with the output capacitor 118. By using the superposition theorem, it can be seen from FIG. 6 how v,, and Vo2 are added together to give vy. FIG. 7a shows the equiva- lent circuit of the entire system, in which the voltage regulator 110 is modeled by a current source I,,,, driving the load 120. FIGS. 76 and 7c show the equivalent circuits with I,,,-0 and VeompO; respectively. icon\n\nIt can be seen therefore that the first and second examples of a voltage/current regulator in accordance with the inven- tion provide at least a method of compensating an output signal ofa regulator, wherein said method comprises the steps of sensing an output signal at a passive component at an output of the regulator; generating a compensating signal based on a difference signal, said difference signal compris- ing a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regulator and the sensed output signal; and applying said compensating signal to said passive output component to reduce said difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal.\n\nThe compensator circuit 122 compares v, with Verto give an error or difference voltage signal v, which is then amplified y an amplifier G_(S) 134 to provide v,,,,,, for compensating v,. The voltage signal v,., whichis derived from v,,,,,, in FIG. 7c, is obtained by the transfer function G,,,(S)-\u00a5,.(1S V0 omp (s). The compensator circuit 122 derives a modified output voltage v,, from v, and v,, for the controller stage 116.", "type": "Document"}}
