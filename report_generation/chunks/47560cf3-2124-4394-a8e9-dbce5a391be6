The first input device is electrically connected to the first processor. The first input device is configured to generate a first controlling signal to the first processor, and the first processor adjusts the enhancement weight based on the first controlling signal and the hearing profile.\n\nIn\n\n20\n\n20\n\nprocessing techniques may be based on those disclosed in Cappotto, D., Xuan, W., Meng, Q., Zhang, C., and Schnupp, J., \u201cDominant Melody Enhancement in Cochlear Implants,\u201d 2018 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Asso- ciation Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)\u2014 Proceedings (pp. 398-402), [8659661] (Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference\u2014Proceedings), IEEE, 2018; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\nVarious embodiments of the present invention provide a modification of audio signals by signal processing of the original audio source or by the generation of new audio content based on features extracted from the original. The auditory stimulus can be played back by one or more loudspeakers, such as consumer headphones or earphones, or used to modify settings (e.g., hardware settings) of a cochlear implant. The above can be used to personalize the auditory stimulus produced by such devices in order to adjust for the unique characteristics of a user\u2019s perception of musical features and the limitations of their cochlear implant.", "type": "Document"}}
