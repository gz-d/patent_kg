More specifically the present invention relates to a biomimetic, nanofiber-based and direc- tional moisture-wicking electronic skin and a fabrication method thereof.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\ninterest\n\nThe global\n\nwearable bioelectronics,\n\nin\n\n[0003]\n\ncapable of detecting and quantifying physiological data arising from human movements, has surged. Conventional rigid electrodes, typically affixed to the skin or organs using tapes or clips, often yield incompatible contact with the human body, leading to distorted or highly noisy physical signals. Recent advancements in flexible electronic skins address these issues, offering characteristics such as light- weight, ultra-thinness, and comfort. These innovations find applications in personalized health management, man-ma- chine interfaces, and artificial intelligence. However, many flexible bioelectronics with impressive acquisition perfor- mance are constructed using impermeable polymer mem- branes or gels, impeding gas or moisture exchange between the human skin and the ambient environment. This limita- tion can result in interference from externally induced thermal or moisture effects. Extended contact periods can lead to sweat deposition, causing discomfort and signal\n\ndistortion.\n\n[0004] Electrospinning technology has rapidly evolved for large-scale manufacturing of fibrous membranes. Nanofiber networks created through electrospinning exhibit a high specific surface area, excellent flexibility, and diverse pore sizes, making them promising candidates for highly sensi- tive and breathable electronic skins. Recent studies have focused on developing high-performance, monofunctional pressure sensors or nanogenerators using nanofibrous mem- branes, demonstrating good conductivity or energy harvest- ing in specific applications.", "type": "Document"}}
