In an aspect, to facili- tate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, a first type of switch (e.g., a power switch, which can be a voltage-controlled self-driven (VCSD) switch) can be asso- ciated with a high-side portion of a self-driven gate-drive (SDGD) subsystem, and can be turned on (e.g., placed in or transitioned to an on state) when the voltage across such switch is forward-biased; and there can be another of\n\nSynchronous rectifiers, based on the use of power metal- oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) to\n\naims at low-voltage applications, it is not suitable for mains voltage operations.
