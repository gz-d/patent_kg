The device includes a body having a portion formed with a circumference extending about an axis, a rechargeable battery housed within the body, a first connec- tion circuit in connection with the rechargeable battery dis- posed within the body, and a removable cap adapted to fit over and at least partly surround the body portion. The cap includes an integrally formed secondary winding surrounding the body portion about the axis, the secondary winding being adapted to receive magnetic flux extending from a planar charging surface. The cap further includes a layer of magnetic material disposed between the secondary winding and the body portion for reducing current induced in the body of the electrical device, anda second connection circuit for connect- ing the secondary winding to the first connection circuit so as to charge the rechargeable battery in the body. The cap is arranged to be in contact with the planar charging surface and to support the electrical device on the planar charging surface during charging of the electrical device, and the secondary winding is arranged to be substantially parallel to the planar charging surface so that lines of magnetic flux extending from the planar charging surface pass substantially perpendicu- larly through the secondary winding during charging of the\n\nA disadvantage with such conventional arrangements, however, is that with the proliferation in various types of portable electrical devices most users of such devices have to have a corresponding number of charging adaptors which may be mutually incompatible. Many charging adaptors may be designed to work with one device only.", "type": "Document"}}
