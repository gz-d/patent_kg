Each participant\u2019s eye movements for viewing each stimulus were summarized using HMM. Individual HMMs for viewing each stimulus were clustered to discover representative strategies among the participants. Co-clustering was then used to cluster participants into 2 groups according to whether they used similar eye movement strategies across the stimuli (FIGURE 2). To examine whether natural or man-made images could induce larger individual differences in eye movement pattern, the difference between group strategies for each stimulus were quantified via the symmetric KL (SKL) divergence between the two group HMMs. The SKL is given by (KLj2+KL21)/2, where KL}, 1s the KL divergence between the Group 1 HMM and the Group 2 HMM using Group 1 data (Chuk, Chan, Hsiao, 2014), and vice-versa for KL; (KL 1s not symmetric). SKL measures were compared for natural and man-made images and the characteristics of the images that typically led\n\nlarger SKL were determined.\n\nIt was also examined whether the 2 groups of participants differed in performance in foreground object recognition and the cognitive tasks. To examine the correlations between eye movement pattern and recognition performance/cognitive abilities, the similarity of a participant\u2019s pattern to the group strategies were examined using a cluster score, CS = (|Li|- ILo}) / (Li|+|L2|), where Li and L are the log-likelihoods of a participant\u2019s data being generated under Group | and Group 2 strategy, respectively (Chan et al., 2018). Larger positive values of CS indicate higher similarity to Group 1, and smaller negative values indicate similarity to Group 2.", "type": "Document"}}
