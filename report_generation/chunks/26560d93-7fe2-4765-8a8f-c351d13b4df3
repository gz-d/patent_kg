Preferably, the layer 20 includes a plurality of uniform and densely packed nanoparticles 22, together forming different surface morphologies at nanoscale level on the surface region of the metallic struc- ture 10. The morphologies of nanoparticles 22 may be presented in various forms of nanostructures such as but not limited to nanospheres, nanospindles, nanoplates, nanopy- ramids, nanowires, nanocones, nanoshuttles, and dendrites etc. Preferably, the nano-structured metallic layer 20 may be made of the first metallic material i.e. Silver or the second metallic material selected from Copper, Cobalt, Iron or Nickel.\n\n[0045] FIG. 34 is the SEM image of topological nanotex- at Ag surface generated in 0.1 M nitric solution with second potential extreme (P1, P2);\n\n[0046] FIG. 3c is the SEM image of Cu nanomaterials formed at Ag surface by adding Cu salts to nitric solution;\n\n[0047] FIG. 3d is the SEM image of Cu nanomaterials formed at Ag surface by adding Cu salts to nitric solution;", "type": "Document"}}
