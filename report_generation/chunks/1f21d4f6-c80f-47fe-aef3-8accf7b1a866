In still another aspect, the system can include a zero-cross controller component(s) that can facili- tate providing a desired positive voltage signal to a compara- tor(s) associated with a switch(es) (e.g., low-side switch) to facilitate ensuring that the associated switch(es) is in an off state at or near zero-crossing points during half-cycles of the signal.
