Accordingly, the present invention may further relate to a method of inhibiting the entry of an enterovirus and/or a lentivirus into host cells, comprising contacting the host cells with an effective amount of ber-\n\noO\n\nthe its\n\nhost\n\nat\n\nleast\n\nUS 2021/0060002 A1\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\n8\n\nbamine or its analogue as described above .
