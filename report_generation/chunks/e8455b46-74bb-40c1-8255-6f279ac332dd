Notable examples of lysine PTMs include methylation, acetylation, lipidation, ubiq- uitination, sumoylation, and others. Recently the discovery of numerous new lysine acylations, such as succinylation (Ksucc), crontonylation (Ker), 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib), and f-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), has further expanded the landscapes of lysine PTMs. Deciphering the mechanisms of these new lysine PTMs is important to further elucidate their biological functions. Research in this field has therefore seen tremendous development and\n\nExample 2: Chemical Proteomic Profiling Using the Probe KPlip\n\ncal proteomics experiments were performed. An overview of the chemical proteomics methodology is shown in FIG. 3. The chemical proteomics sought to identify potential inter- acting proteins of KPlip in the cellular environment. To minimize \u201cfalse hits\u201d produced by nonspecific protein bind- ing, probe KPlip-C was used in parallel as a negative control. The probes (10 1M) were incubated with live HEK 293 cells or cell lysates for 2 h. Following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the KPlip/KPlip-C-labelled proteomes were clicked with biotin azide, enriched by affinity purification, tesolved by SDS-PAGE, and finally analysed by LC-MS/ MS. Upon removal of nonspecific binding proteins identi- fied from the control probe KPlip-C, only the proteins that were positively identified in both lysate and live-cell experi- ments were chosen as potential targets. This led to a probe-", "type": "Document"}}
