The correction device can comprise one or more support members in various forms. For example, the support member can comprise one or more support- ing rods of various shapes depending on the sagittal pro- file of the spine. In one exemplary embodiment, the sup- porting rod can be contoured to assume the normal de- grees of spine kyphosis and lordosis. In another exem- plary embodiment, the supporting rod can have such a length to span across the deformed spine portion. In a further exemplary embodiment, the supporting rod can have various cross-sections. For example, the support- ing rod can have circular, oval, square, hexagonal, or other shapes or a combination thereof. It will be appre- ciated that other forms of the supporting rod and the sup- port member are also within the scope of the present invention. [0025] The support member can be placed at various positions in relation to the spine. In an exemplary em- bodiment, the support member can be provided to extend along at least a portion of the spine. For example, the support member can have such a length to span across the deformed spine portion and bridge the intact verte- brae. Additionally or alternatively, the support member can be placed in the posterior or anterior aspect of the", "type": "Document"}}
