The flexible substrate 102 is flexible and bendable such that it can be wrapped around a curved surface. The flexible substrate 102 does not permanently deform i.e. plastically deform when it is bent or twisted e.g. wrapped around an arm of a user or wrapped a portion of a user\u2019s body. The flexible substrate 102 further does not crack or break when bent. In one example the flexible substrate 102 comprises polyimide. In one example the flexible substrate 102 comprises a flexible polyimide sheet. As shown in FIG. 1A the flexible substrate 102 is a sheet. The flexible substrate 102 is a rectangular shaped sheet, as shown in FIG. 1. The flexible substrate 102 is quite thin to allow it to be flexible. The flexible substrate 102 comprises a thickness between 250 micrometres to 750 micrometres. In one example construction the thickness of\n\n[0142] The p type semiconductor element 112 and the n type semiconductor element 114 are elongate legs i.e. elon- gate members. Each leg comprises a longitudinal axis A that is longer than a transverse axis B of the leg. The legs 112, 114 are positioned on the flexible substrate sheet 102 in a manner that the longitudinal axis A of each leg 112, 114 is arranged substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis C of the flexible substrate 102 sheet, as shown in FIG. 1A.\n\n[0143] The semiconductor elements 112, 114 are formed from a thermoelectric material i.e. a material that responds to eat or a temperature gradient. A thermoelectric material is formed from a semiconductor material, in which, charges move i.e. a current is caused due to a heat ie. due to a temperature gradient. The p type semiconductor element 112 comprises a semiconductor that is doped to be a p type semiconductor i.e. a semiconductor where the main charge carriers are holes.", "type": "Document"}}
