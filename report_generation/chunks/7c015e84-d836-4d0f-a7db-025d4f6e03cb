It would be appreciated that the treatment of flavivirus infection may involve inhibition of the viral proteins in the infected subject, killing of the virus, allevi- ating symptoms caused by the virus, and/or inhibiting the synthesis of the virus, or the combinations thereof.\n\n[0062] The term \u201csubject\u201d in particular refers to an animal or human, in particular a mammal and most preferably human. In an embodiment, the subject is susceptible to a flavivirus infection, or is suffering from a flavivirus infec- tion. In a further embodiment, the subject is suffering from two different types of RNA virus infections. In an example embodiment, the subject is susceptible to or suffering from an enterovirus infection, lentivirus infection or a combina- tion thereof.\n\nNO)\n\nof\n\n\u2018oO\n\nUS 2021/0060002 A1\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\n6\n\ncontinued\n\ncontinued\n\nOH\n\nBr\n\nO , and\n\n0 ,\n\n[ 0067 ] The above compounds were identified and consid\n\nered to have a similar 3D conformation with berbamine .\n\nParticularly , these compounds were identified using berbam\n\nBr ,\n\nine as reference and therefore it is believed that they can\n\nachieve similar or identical inhibitory effect as berbamine .
