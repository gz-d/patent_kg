To compensate for voltage sag caused. by a reduction in the flux generated by the first winding, a second winding is located within an area defined by the first winding for generating an auxiliary magnetic flux generally perpendicular to the charging surface.\n\n(30) Foreign Application Priority Data\n\nAug. 19, 2005 (GB) 0517082.4\n\nGD) Int.
