Implementa- tion results show that the system could compute Dilithium security level 2 Key generation, Sign, and Verify in 1.10 ms, 5.93 ms, and 1.17 ms, respectively. Compared with the pure software implementation, the software/hardware co-design achieves a speedup of 6.3-33.2 times.\n\n[0129] Advantageously, the hybrid processor consumes reasonable amount of hardware resources and obtains high acceleration results, and it is observed that software/hard-\n\nof\n\na\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nware co-design achieves a good balance in speed, resources, and flexibility compared with existing pure software an hardware designs. A summary of the present invention provided as follows:\n\n[0130] In pursuit of configurability, a flexible SoC architecture is designed for both software and hardware computation. A fully parameterized versatile design o: hardware accelerator enables a run-time configuration to adjust the computation for Dilithium of different security levels.\n\n[0131] In order to maintain a good speed-area trade-off, ahybrid NTT/INTT module is design for both NTT anc INTT. The separated NTT and INTT algorithms are combined and the hybrid architecture is able to reused hardware resources for NTT/INTT computation. More- over, hardware accelerators for the time-consuming SHAKE and point-wise addition/multiplication are designed to speed up the whole Dilithium system. The SHAKE module supports high speed SHA-3 related PRNG functions and sampling functions.", "type": "Document"}}
