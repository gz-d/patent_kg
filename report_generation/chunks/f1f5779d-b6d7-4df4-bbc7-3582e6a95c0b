Any of the alternative embodiments and features in the alternative embodiments can be used in combination with each other or with the embodiments described with respect to the figures.\n\n[0249] The foregoing describes only a preferred embodi- ment of the present invention and modifications, obvious to those skilled in the art, can be made thereto without depart- ing from the scope of the present invention. While the invention has been described with reference to a number of preferred embodiments it should be appreciated that the invention can be embodied in many other forms.\n\n[0241] The AC impedance spectra given in FIGS. 25A to 25D indicated that the AD-gel electrolyte exhibited high ionic conductivity when containing different ions, such as Zn**, Li*, H*, and Na*ions, implying the promising com- patibility of the AD-gel electrolyte to other energy storage devices. As an demonstration, the AD-gel electrolyte was integrated into another battery system of Zn\u2014LiMn,O, battery (Zn-LMO battery).\n\n[0242] As shown in FIG. 26A, the Zn-LMO battery exhib- ited evident reversible redox peaks with higher potential than those of Zn\u2014-MnO, battery system. For cycling perfor- mance of the ZN-LMO battery at different temperatures, it delivered a capacity of 90 mA h g\u2122! at 0.3 A g\u2122! with a retention of 97.56% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles at 25\u00b0 C. A high cycling stability to temperature is also manifested for the Zn-LMO battery with 89.52% (80\u00b0 C.) and 91.17% (-20\u00b0 C.) capacity retentions after 100 cycles at 0.3 A g\u2122', respectively (FIGS. 26B to 26D).", "type": "Document"}}
