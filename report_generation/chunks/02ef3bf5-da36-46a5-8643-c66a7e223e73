Additionally, a metal salt, specifically lithium chloride or sodium chloride, is integrated into the conductive coating layer to enhance its overall performance.\n\n[0068] This biomimetic electronic fabric demonstrates high levels of directional moisture-wicking, offering a com- bination of sensitivity, rapid response times, and reliable recovery eriods when used as a pressure sensor or as an energy harvester/nanogenerator. The materials and fabrica- tion methods employed contribute to a versatile, cost-effec- tive, and scalable solution for various applications, including wearable electronics and smart textiles.\n\n[0069] In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, a method of fabricating the biomimetic, nanofi- ber-based, and directional moisture-wicking wearable elec- tronic fabric is provided. It incorporates several sequential steps. Initially, either the hydrophobic nanofiber layer or the superhydrophilic nanofiber layer is formed by utilizing the electrospinning technique. Following this, the conductive coating layer is electrosprayed onto a side of either the\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nhydrophobic or the superhydrophilic layer. Subsequently, the remaining layer, whether it be the hydrophobic or superhydrophilic nanofiber layer, is formed on the conduc- tive coating layer, thus establishing the multilayer composite structure with the conductive coating layer positioned as the middle layer. The final step involves the drying of the fabricated layers, resulting in the biomimetic, nanofiber- based, and directional moisture-wicking wearable electronic fabric.", "type": "Document"}}
