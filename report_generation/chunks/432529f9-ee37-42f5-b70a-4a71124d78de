Electrochemical tests based on ASTM G5-94 (1999) and G61-86 (1998) were performed by a potentiostat (VersaStat II EG&G, USA) using a standard simulated body fluid (SBF) at a pH of 7.42 and temperature of 3770.5 1C (37.5\u00b0 C.). The ion concentrations in the SBF are shown in Table 4. A cyclic potential spanning between -400 and +1600 mV was applied at a scanning rate of 600 mV/h. Before the electrochemical tests, the medium was purged with nitrogen for 1 h to remove dissolved oxygen and nitrogen purging continued throughout the measurements. The SBF taken from each sample after the corrosion test was analyzed for Ni and Ti employing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) (Perkin Elmer, PE SCIEX ELAN6100, USA). The amounts of Ni leached from all treated samples were signifi- cantly reduced. The magnitudes were only about 0.03 to 0.04% of that of the control samples. The ion concentrations\n\nThe treatment methods for acetylene, nitrogen and oxygen implantation the sample were ground, polished to a shiny surface texture, and then ultrasonically cleaned with acetone and ethanol before deposition or implantation was conducted in the plasma immersion ion implanter. The deposition and implantation parameters of acetylene, nitrogen and oxygen implantation samples were displayed in Table 1. The elemen- tal depth profiles as shown in FIG. 1 were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Physical Electron- ics PHI 5802, Minnesota, USA).\n\nTABLE 1", "type": "Document"}}
