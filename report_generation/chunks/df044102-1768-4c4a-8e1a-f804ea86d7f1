The coupled windings 11a, 114 will give an equivalent negative inductance in series with the capacitor. Although the ESL can be canceled, the structure will produce an additional inductance in series with the load 36. Moreover, it cannot cancel the ESR effect. This will affect the dynamic behavior of the output voltage across the load 36. Such struc- ture is more suitable for input filter design. Nevertheless, the coupling effect is highly dependent on the magnetic proper- ties of the core materials of the coupled windings.\n\nThere are many electronic circuit or system designs where parasitic inductance is a significant element that restricts cir- cuit performance. Given an applied voltage, the parasitic inductance limits the rate at which the current can change. At high frequencies, parasitic inductance can have a major impact on chip performance and can cause chip failure if inductance is not properly detected and corrected. Self induc- tance is a property of a circuit whereby a change in current causes a change in voltage especially in circuit designs con- taining long paths or board traces. Mutual inductance com- prises the full electromagnetic effect of one current loop over another especially in circuit designs containing long paths that shielded.\n\nA prior-art method using the second approach is based on adding passive circuits. The parasitic effects are canceled at the circuit level. By extending the first approach, a coupled. winding that can cancel parasitic inductance of capacitors in an electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter has been pro- posed. In other approaches, some active noise cancellation circuits that can cancel the undesired effects caused by the parasitic elements have been proposed.\n\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
