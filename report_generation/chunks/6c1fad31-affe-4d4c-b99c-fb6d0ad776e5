The depth videos employed can be the original depth video or the synthesized depth video at the virtual viewpoint. The advantage of using the original depth video is it has better picture quality as compared with using the synthesized depth video. However, the disadvan- tage is the original depth video at the virtual viewpoint may not available. Using the synthesized depth video may be more practical in some applications.\n\nlyze the influence from different reference depth videos used. in the method of the present embodiment. Since sequence \u201cLovebirds\u201d and \u201cNewspaper\u201d do not have corresponding original depth video at the virtual viewpoint, all the rest eight sequences in the database were used for comparison. Similarly, the testing database is also categorized as four datasets, U;C,, CrUp: C;C,, and ALL dataset. The PLCC, SROCC, RMSE results are demonstrated in FIG. 17. To distinguish these reduced datasets from those in Section III subsection B, they are marked with \u201c*\u201d. The left three columns are the results from the synthesized depth video. As shown in FIG. 17, the values of most PLCC, SROCC and RMSE on the test datasets are a little better than the results of using the original depth video. Basically, they are com- parable. It indicates that although the original depth video has more precise depth values, the synthesized depth video, which are generated through DIBR from two original depth videos, is comparable or a little better in the synthesized video quality prediction. Moreover, using the synthesized depth video is more practical. The main reason is the depth video is used to help locate the flicker area by using edge detection and dilation. The original depth video has more precise depth values but may have geometrical misalign- ment with the synthesized texture video. Therefore, the", "type": "Document"}}
