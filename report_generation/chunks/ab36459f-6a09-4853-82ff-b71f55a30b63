For example, circuitry 1708 can include coupling circuitry to collect, condition, transport, or otherwise deliver suitable power to electrical components of solar energy col- lection system 1700, including, but not limited to communi- cations antenna 1702. As a further example, circuitry 1708 can include any of (and any number or combination of) elec- trical transmission lines, electrical storage components, volt- age regulators, signal conditioners, Wilkinson power dividers 1400, switches, relays, and other electrical components suit- able for converting, storing, and transporting the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) 1706. Accordingly, circuitry 1708 of solar energy collection system 1700 can facilitate employing at least a portion of the electri- cal potential in the operation of the communications antenna 1702.\n\nIn further non-limiting implementations, selective trans- mission layers 1806 (e.g., coatings or overlays 802, etc.) of solar energy collection system 1800 can include a metal grid (e.g., a grid of a metal, a metal wire, or a metallic composi- tion, etc.), as further described above regarding FIGS. 7-8. In yet other non-limiting implementations, given the predeter- mined wavelengths of the incident solar radiation and the reflected communications signals, the grid can be further configured or adapted with a grid spacing (e.g., grid spacing\n\nAccording to still further exemplary embodiments, solar energy collection system 1700 can further include one or more one antenna element(s) 1710 (e.g., SPA 102, associated\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\ncreate\n\nsignals.\n\nUS 8,599,081 B2\n\n13\n\n14", "type": "Document"}}
