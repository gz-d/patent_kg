Subsequently, the MXene/CNTs conductive ink is electros- prayed onto the C-PVDF nanofibers layer. Electrospraying facilitates control over the spraying time and thickness, preserving the porous nature of the fiber substrate with thin spraying layers. The presence of carboxylic CNTs is instru- mental in fostering interactions among C-PVDF, MXenes, and CNTs, preventing the mutual stacking of MXene lamel- lae and acting as a bridge between MXenes. Finally, a thick and superhydrophilic outer protective layer of PAN nanofi- ers is constructed by electrospinning PAN precursor solu- tion onto the C-PVDF/MXene-CNTs layer. This electronic fabric effectively pulls sweat away from the skin and sensing layer, enabling quick evaporation with a wider wetting area and ensuring stable bioelectric signal acquisition. The con- structed electronic fabric ensures accurate all-over physi- ological monitoring and achieves biomechanical energy arvesting through the single-electrode triboelectric mecha- nism. When serving as a pressure sensor, the MXene/CNTs layer functions as the conductive sensing layer, perceiving pressure-induced structural changes and converting them into electrical signals via the interdigital electrode. In its role as a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG), the MXene/CNTs layer acts as the charge acquisition elec-\n\ntrode.\n\nExample 2.
