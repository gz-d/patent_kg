Gen- eral probabilistic graphical models, such as Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks like those created by struc- ture search using a Bayesian model score or approximation can also be utilized. In addition, linear classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs), non-linear classifiers like methods referred to as \u201cneural network\u201d methodologies, fuzzy logic methodologies also can be employed. Moreover, game theoretic models (e.g., game trees, game matrices, pure and mixed strategies, utility algorithms, Nash equilibria, evo- lutionary game theory, etc.) and other approaches that per- form data fusion, etc., can be exploited in accordance with implementing various automated aspects described herein. The foregoing techniques or methods can be applied to analy- sis of the historic and/or current data associated with systems and methods disclosed herein to facilitate making inferences or determinations related to systems and methods disclosed\n\nReferring to FIG. 9, a flow diagram of an example method 900 that can control (e.g., automatically or dynamically, in real time) switching or selecting of a particular display mode ofa plurality of available display modes of a barrier compo- nent in accordance with various embodiments and aspects of the disclosed subject matter is illustrated. The method 900 can be implemented by a barrier control component to facili- tate controlling switching or selecting of a particular display mode of a plurality of available display modes of a barrier component in relation to presentation of different types of video content on a projector screen component.", "type": "Document"}}
