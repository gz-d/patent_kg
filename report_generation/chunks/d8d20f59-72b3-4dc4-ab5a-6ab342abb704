It includes a broadband light source for providing a polychromatic light beam; a common- path spectral interferometer which provides simplified opti- cal configuration and reduced fabrication cost in comparison to previous Michelson approach. In addition, an electroni- cally controlled liquid crystal variable retarder can be pro- vided to introduce carrier frequency modulation without mechanical moving part. Also, an SPR sensing unit, which is based on either an SPR or an LRSPR sensing layer configu- ration, can be adopted for receiving a multi-wavelength light beam at fixed angles of incident and introducing a specific phase retardation change in each incident wavelength within the polychromatic beam, and a single channel spectral ana- lyzer unit can be provided for receiving the light emerging from spectral interferometer to provide a series of spectral oscillation for further processing to find the differential phase retardation introduced by the SPR sensor unit, which ulti- mately leads to the determination of the refractive index shift caused by the binding of biomolecules to the sensing surface. A processing unit can be provided for analyzing the interfero- metric signal traces generated from the recombination of the reference and signal polarized beams that finally the mea- sured refractive index shift in the sensor surface. The intro- duction of a polychromatic light source in spectral phase- sensitive SPR sensor system drastically increases the detection dynamic range of the system. This also permits the incorporation of LRSPR sensor layer design, which is known to offer very high phase detection resolution because of its narrow resonance peak, so that the limited operational range can be compensated by the multi-wavelength approach.
