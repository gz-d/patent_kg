The described and/or illustrated embodiments of the invention should therefore be considered in all respects as illustrative, not restrictive. Example optional features of some embodiments of the invention are provided in the summary and the description. Some embodiments of the invention may include one or more of these optional features (some of which are not specifically illustrated in the drawings). Some embodiments of the invention may lack one or more of these optional features (some of which are not specifically illus- trated in the drawings). In some embodiments, the construc- tion of the device may be different from those illustrated. For example, the metasurface structure and/or related antenna and antenna system can be of different shapes, sizes, forms, etc. than those illustrated. The metasurface structure and/or related antenna and antenna system can be used to process EM waves of different frequency or frequencies, not limited to microwaves. The \u201clight\u201d referred to in some examples may be EM wave such as microwave, mm-Wave, etc. The metasurface structure and/or related antenna and antenna system may be applied in different applications (e.g., devices/systems), such as but not limited to cellular (e.g., 5G, 6G, or above) communications, non-contact sensing, RFID system, Li-Fi (Light Fidelity), LIDAR systems, ete. It should be noted that in embodiments in which the metasur- face structure includes subwavelength units that can operate (operable) to manipulate or control all five of the funda- mental EM wave properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum), the metasurface structure need not always operate to manipulate or control all five proper- ties at the same time; instead the metasurface structure can manipulate or control any one or more or all of them at the same time", "type": "Document"}}
