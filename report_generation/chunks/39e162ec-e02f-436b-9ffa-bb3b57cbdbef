Consistent with these findings, correlation analysis showed that participants\u2019 eye movement pattern similarity to the explorative strategy (EF scale) was correlated negatively with preference ratings, r(60) = .301, p = .018; positively with scene recognition performance in d\u2019, r(60) =.381, p = .002; and marginally positively correlated with TOL planning time before executing moves, r(59) = .223, p = .08 (FIGURES 5a-e). Taken together these findings indicate that the explorative strategy is associated with lower image preference rating, better scene recognition performance, decreased facilitation from consistent surrounding cues in the flanker task, and less efficient planning in the TOL task.", "type": "Document"}}
