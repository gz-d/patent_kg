Further, the disclosed subject matter does not require modification of the hardware or software of the projection system (e.g., projector compo- nent). Also, no electrical connection is required between the projection system and the integrated combination of the bar- rier control component, barrier component, and the projector\n\nThe disclosed subject matter can be applied to existing 2-D projections systems. The disclosed subject matter also can increase or improve the ease, flexibility, and/or scalability in producing image and video content, which may comprise a mixture (e.g., combination) of 2-D materials and 3-D mate- rials. For example, a content producer can generate a signal (e.g., video signal) that can facilitate switching between a 2-D display mode and a 3-D display mode according to the signal contained in a region (e.g., signal region in a non-prominent part) of the visual image.", "type": "Document"}}
