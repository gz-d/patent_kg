If the receiver winding 8 does extend beyond the peripheral area it may be considered to be not properly placed on the charging platform.\n\nFIG. 5 is such that even with a slight movement of the large receiver winding 8 in any direction, the receiver winding 8 will always enclose or cover at least one of the smaller trans- mitter windings 7. It will be understood that while FIG. 5 only shows four transmitter windings 7 in practice these four wind- ings are only a small part of a larger regular array of similar windings.", "type": "Document"}}
