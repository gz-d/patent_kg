On a signal processing level, this could be accomplished, for example by enhancing the main melody of the music, enhancing the percussive elements (drums, etc.), using source separation algorithms to enhance only the vocal or only the bass, reducing the complexity of the music through filtering (e.g., frequency filtering), removing the source music entirely and leaving only the enhanced elements, etc. Some of the signal\n\nbe be\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nin an embodiment of the present invention, processing audio signals comprises: adjusting the audio signals using determined hearing profile.\n\nthe\n\nin an embodiment of the present invention, processing the audio signals comprises: digitally adjusting audio signals using the determined hearing profile; and converting the digitally adjusted signals to analog signals using a digital- to-analog converter.\n\nin an embodiment of the present invention, the audio signals are music signals, and the processing of the music signals comprises: adjusting amplitude, phase, and/or fre- quency of one or more or all components of the music signals.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the method further includes: determining a hearing profile of a user of a hearing device, and optionally the hearing profile is deter- mined with the user wearing or using the hearing device.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the hearing device comprises an electronic device in the form of cochlear implant or a hearing aid.", "type": "Document"}}
