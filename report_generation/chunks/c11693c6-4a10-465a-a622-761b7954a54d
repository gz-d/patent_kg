In an embodi- ment herein, the cancer or tumor is of a cancer selected from the group of breast cancer, peritoneal cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and a combination thereof; or ovarian cancer, as these have been shown to sometimes exhibit platinum resistance\n\n[0103] It has also been found that the platinum(IV) com- exes herein may also be useful in treating a bacterial infection; or a bacterial infection caused by bacteria selected from Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and a combination thereof; or Gram-positive bacteria.\n\n[0104] In an embodiment herein, the invention herein may used in conjunction with, for example, radiotherapy, ultrasonic therapy, immune therapy, gene therapy, etc. and combinations thereof so as to enhance the effectiveness of the treatments.", "type": "Document"}}
