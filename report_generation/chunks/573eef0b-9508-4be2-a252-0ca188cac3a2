Each ther- moelectric module is electrically coupled to an adjacent thermoelectric module by a conductor member 116. As shown in FIG. 1A and 1B, thermoelectric module 110 is coupled to thermoelectric module 110A by a conductor member 116. As seen in FIG. 1A, adjacent thermoelectric modules 110-110C are interconnected by conductor mem- bers 116. The conductor members 116 provide intra module connections (i.e. connecting the p and n type element of each thermoelectric module together) and inter module connec- tion (ie. connecting adjacent thermoelectric modules together). The intercomnections define a conductive path for electrical current to travel through. The conductor members 116 interconnect adjacent semiconductor elements.\n\ncontact with a conductor member 116.
