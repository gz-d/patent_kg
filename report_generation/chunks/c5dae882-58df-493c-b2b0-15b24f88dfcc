Conventional multi-wavelength method/sys-\n\ntem requires more than one laser to generate multiple wavelengths; the method/system of the above embodi- ment(s) can generate multiple wavelengths based on single laser.\n\n[0103] In other systems and methods embodiments, one alternative or further advantages may be provided.\n\nmore\n\n[0104] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the invention should there- fore be considered in all respects as illustrative, not restric- tive. For example, the method/system in the above embodi- ments can be applied not only in vivo, but also in vitro. The method/system need not be used to measure properties of human or animals, but can be any other objects, devices, apparatus, etc. Various features indicated as optional (using \u201cmay be\u201d, \u201ce.g.,\u201d, or the like) can be replaced with other alternatives. Various parameters or constants can be set differently, dependent on applications. For example, the wavelengths of the laser pulses can be different from those illustrated; the time delay between the laser pulses can be set\n\ndifferently, etc.\n\n1. A method for determining flow speed based on pho- toacoustic imaging or sensing, comprising:\n\nreceiving a first photoacoustic signal and a second pho- toacoustic signal from a sample in response to trans-\n\nor\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nmission of a first laser pulse and a second laser pulse the sample, the first pulse laser has a first wavelength and the second laser pulse has a second wavelength different from the first wavelength; and\n\nprocessing the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a flow model that relates photoacoustic signals with flow speed to determine flow speed of a liquid flow in the sample.", "type": "Document"}}
