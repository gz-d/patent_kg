A 2D model is simplified from the cross-sectional view of the closed-loop array for study- ing the crack formation process. Controlled crack formation takes place along the direction of the peeling force F; failure occurs when crack forms along the interface (referred to as neck region) of the locked part.\n\n[0033] FIG. 2B shows a study of the controlled elastic cracks in Phase I. A diagram predicting controlled crack formation. The experimental and simula- tion results for the geometries are provided in FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B.\n\n[0034] FIG. 2C shows a study of configurable seal/open of the elastic cracks in Phase II. A geometric illustration showing the test of the configurability. The product loop is pulled out from the self-sealed elastic crack, and the yield point of the loop is checked.\n\n[0023] Furthermore, throughout the specification and claims, unless the context requires otherwise, the word \u201cinclude\u201d or variations such as \u201cincludes\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.\n\n[0035] FIG. 2D shows a study of configurable seal/open elastic cracks in Phase II. The relationship between critical force Fa to open the cracks and the interfacial area the crack. The full names for the abbreviations of poly- mers are provided in the Material and Method section.\n\n[0024] Other definitions for selected terms used herein may be found within the detailed description of the inven- tion and apply throughout. Unless otherwise defined, all other technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention belongs.\n\n[0036] FIG. 3A shows SEM images of the master struc- of a close-loop array with hexagon lattice.\n\n[0037] FIG. 3B shows SEM images of the master structure a close-loop array with square lattice.", "type": "Document"}}
