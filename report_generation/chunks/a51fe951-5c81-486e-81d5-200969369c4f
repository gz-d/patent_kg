The mean and variance can be computed by:\n\nprocessing the operation information with a device mod elling engine to determine one or more operation conditions of the device.\n\n2. A method for monitoring a device in accordance with claim 1, wherein the device modelling engine includes plurality of matching networks for processing the operation information of a plurality of devices.\n\nots a A -U-4\"]\n\n3.

A method for monitoring a device in accordance with claim 5, wherein the base matching network is further processed by training the base matching network with a target data set associated with the individual device so as to generate each of the matching networks for each of the individual devices.\n\n[0114] When the control variable z, exceeds the upper lower control limit, the monitored wind turbine can considered as off-normal. The wind turbine should be iden- tified as normal when z, is between the lower and upper limits.", "type": "Document"}}
