It also comprises two parts. The first part is a multiplier circuit 300 for multiplying rc and ic to realize equation (4). The second part is a voltage follower 320 that generates voltage V2 following the output of the multiplier circuit 300. The preferred embodiment for v,. 118 may include a voltage sensor for sensing the voltage signal across the capacitor 110 or across any part or component of an electronic circuit or system which exhibits capacitance and has associated there- with parasitic inductance that would usefully be compensated to enhance the frequency response of the electronic circuit or system.\n\nform and these values can be used to measure parasitic induc- tance. The method further comprises sensing a voltage signal across said part of the electronic circuit or system and this can be achieved using a voltage sensor of known type. The method also comprises determining from said sensed voltage signal and said value of the series parasitic effect a parasitic voltage associated with said part of the electronic circuit or system; and adding a voltage source in series with said part of the electronic circuit or system; wherein said voltage source is arranged to deliver a compensating voltage of generally equal magnitude but generally opposite phase to said determined parasitic voltage.\n\nThe part of the electronic circuit or system identified exhibiting capacitance may comprise any of: an electronic system itself, a printed circuit board \u2018PCB\u2019, ora component element on said PCB such as an inductor, a diode, a transistor, wires or board traces.", "type": "Document"}}
