In FIG. 8B, as compared with the embodiment of FIG. 1C, the elongated conductive strip portions 106A, 106C are no longer perpendicular to the strip portions 106B, 106D, but at an angle of less than 90 degrees to the strip portions 106B, 106D. In FIG. 8C, as compared. with the embodiment of FIG. 1C, the elongated conductive strip portions 106A, 106C are no longer rectangular but triangular. In FIG. 8D, as compared with the embodiment of FIG. 1C, the elongated conductive strip portions 108B, 108C are no longer perpendicular to the long sides, but at an angle of less than 90 degrees to the long sides. Also, the elongated conductive strip portions 108B, 108C taper from one long side to the other long side.", "type": "Document"}}
