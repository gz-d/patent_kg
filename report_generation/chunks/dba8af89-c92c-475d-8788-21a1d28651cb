Specifically, FIG. 27 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 up- converts the input frequency fo to f)+f,, in free space. In this example, the input frequency and modulation frequency are {,=23.5 GHz and f,-1.2 MHz respectively. FIG. 27 also shows the measured input spectrum and the residual spec- trum of the waveguide, and the output spectrum in free space. In this example, the harmonic frequencies inside the waveguide and free space are suppressed by as much as 25 dB and 21 dB below the fundamental frequency, respec- tively, due to the large momentum mismatch inside the waveguide and free space. The residual power of the wave- guide at the fundamental frequency is 14.7 dB below the input one due to the guided-wave-to-propagating-wave con- version of the metasurface antenna.\n\n[0146] FIGS. 28 to 33 relate to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for wave manipulation without fre- quency shifting. Specifically, FIG. 28 shows the guided- wave-to-propagating-wave conversion or translation at the fundamental frequency (m=0). In this example, spatiotem- poral modulation forms an equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envelope along the length of the metasurface aperture of the metasurface antenna 400. The n=-1 space harmonic becomes fast and radiates into free space with arbitrary software-defined wave properties. FIG. 29 shows the ran- domization of the STC matrix to suppress higher-order harmonic frequencies. FIGS. 30 to 33 illustrate independent EM wave properties manipulation at the fundamental fre- quency. Specifically, FIG. 30 relates to polarization control, FIG. 31 relates to momentum control, FIG. 32 relates to phase control, and FIG. 33 relates to amplitude control. In these examples, the controls are achieved by tuning the equivalent spatial period A, space shift Ax of the amplitude envelope, modulation depth M, and spatial period and\n\nspace", "type": "Document"}}
