For example, the locking process can be carried out by triggering shape change ina NiTi anchor member, such as through heating. In an exemplary embodi- ment, a heating device, such as an electromagnetic device, can be used to provide the heat. In one exemplary embodi- ment, the heating device can be applied to the skin in a close proximity to the NiTi anchor member. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the locking process are also within the scope of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
