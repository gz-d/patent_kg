The dielectric substrate may include one or more substrate layers. The second electrically conductive layer may be embedded in the dielectric substrate or arranged on another side of the dielectric substrate. The first electrically conductive layer may have even or uneven thickness. The second electrically conductive layer may have even or uneven thickness. The substrate layer(s) of the dielectric substrate may have even or uneven thickness. The plurality of electrically conductive elements may include metallic via-holes and/or metallic posts extending at least partly through the dielectric sub- strate. The metasurface structure is at least partly arranged on or in (e.g., etched in) the first electrically conductive layer. In some embodiments, the first and second slots of the plurality of subwavelength units of the metasurface structure are formed (e.g., etched) in or on the first electrically\n\nconductive layer.\n\n[0033] In some embodiments, the plurality of electrically conductive elements are disposed in multiple rows (e.g multiple generally parallel rows).\n\n[0034] In some embodiments, each of the plurality of subwavelength units of the metasurface structure is respec- tively operably coupled with two or more of the electrically conductive elements.", "type": "Document"}}
