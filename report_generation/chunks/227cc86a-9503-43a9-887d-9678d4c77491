With reference to FIG. 6A, it shows the data flow of the SHAKE module 102D. This module mainly consists of three units, including the read ctrl unit, the Keecak core unit and the sampling unit. The read ctrl unit controls the read data flow, which is shown in FIG. 6B. In the read_state, data is read from the input FIFO to the Keccak core unit. When the Keccak core unit is full and cannot receive new input data, a 1-bit full signal is sent. The control state then transfers to the hold state, where a hold counter is used to count until the end of hold state.\n\n[0109] The Keccak core unit may be further adjusted and improved. The newly designed Keccak core contains addi- tional register to hold the state in the permutation block. The -bit hold signal is to control the hold state, so the permu- tation process can be paused to wait for the end of the sampling process. The input padder accepts 64 bits input data every cycle and gets 1344 bits with padding after 17 or 21 cycles. The valid output bits of input padder are 1088 or 344, depending on the 2-bit shake_mode signal. The final output is obtained through repeated permutation and all the process cost 48 cycles. The valid final output bits are 1088 or 1344, depending on the 2-bit shake_mode signal. The intermediate 1600-bit data XOR with 1344-bit from input padder, until all the input bits are absorbed. The 1-bit last signal indicates the last input and the 3-bit byte signal is the valid input bytes. The final 1344-bit can go back into new round of permutation with 48 cycles until no more output bits are required. The 1-bit squeeze signal is to control the continued of the bits.\n\n[0110]\n\ngeneration output Preferably, the sampling unit may\n\ninclude\n\nfour", "type": "Document"}}
