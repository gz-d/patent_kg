Disclosed herein is a system that can include a barrier control component configured to dynamically generate a con- trol signal in real time, based at least in part on a signal sensed from a control region of a projector screen component that presents video content received from a projector component, and transmit the control signal to a barrier component to facilitate controlling selection of a display mode and a corre- sponding barrier pattern that correspond to the control signal and a type of video content being presented, wherein the signal is indicative of the display mode and the corresponding barrier pattern to use to process the video content. The system. also can include a sensor component configured to monitor the control region and sense the signal emitted from the\n\nHowever, when an ordinary 2-D image is displayed in this manner, the resolution can be significantly degraded (e.g., blurry) due in part to the ordinary 2-D image being negatively affected by the parallax barrier. In practice, it can be difficult to change the projector screen (e.g., rear projector screen) according to whether the displayed images are 2-D or 3-D in nature.\n\nThe degradation when displaying a projected ordinary 2-D image can be overcome with the use of an active parallax\n\nand\n\nThree-dimensional (3-D) visual effects have been around\n\nticular\n\narray.
