Exemplary anchor members 30 can include, but are not limited to, wires, threads, hooks, screws, clamps and the like. In an ex- emplary embodiment, one or more anchor members 30 used can be the same as the securing elements 20 dis- cussed above. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more anchor members 30 can be in the form of a trans- verse traction member 32 (see Fig. 2). Such transverse traction member 32 is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant force for correcting various spinal deformities as will be discussed in detail below. [0041] The anchor members 30 can be used in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, the anchor members 30 can join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4 at the time of operation. In an- other exemplary embodiment, one or more anchor mem- bers 30 can be linked to at least one of the support mem- ber 10 and the deformed spine portion 4 but left unlocked at the time of operation. The unlocked anchor members 30 can later join the support member 10 to the deformed spine portion 4 by various means after the operation. [0042] The correction device 1 is capable of fully or substantially fully correcting spinal deformities. In an ex- emplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be", "type": "Document"}}
