As depicted in Fig. 4b, In the case of switching-off state, negative and positive ions are randomly aistributed in the bulk water layer and the amount of EDL formed at the water/PFFE is insignificant. In contrast, wnen the TIDE-G is in the switching-on mode, there is a preferential separation in the positive and negative charges, thus avoiding the screening effect dominated in the switching-off state Fig. 4c. In this condition, the number of positive-negative charges at the water/PTFE interface is two orders of magnitude larger than its counterpart (Fig. 4d).\n\nthe\n\nThe entire system from a simple energy perspective was also analyzed.\n\nIn the switching-on", "type": "Document"}}
