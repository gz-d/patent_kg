In some embodiments, the coupling arrange- ment includes an even-mode-shorted coupler for enabling or sustaining an out-of-phase coupling mode between one oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-1 of the radia- tor unit 2700-1 and an adjacent oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-2 of the radiator unit 2700-2. In some embodiments, the even-mode-shorted coupler of the cou- pling arrangement may include a transmission line arrange- ment electrically connected between one oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-1 of the radiator unit 2700-1 and the adjacent oscillator of the oscillator arrangement 2702-2 of the radiator unit 2700-2, and a capacitive arrange- ment electrically connected with the transmission line arrangement and operable to facilitate shorting of an even-\n\nmode impedance.
