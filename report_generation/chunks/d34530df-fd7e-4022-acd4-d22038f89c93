In accordance with one\n\nembodiment, a stroke assessment system is provided and it comprises a medical data collection module 104 for receiving combinations of one or more of three different types of data, which are structured data element 101, textural data element 102 and image data element 103. The data collection module 104 may save in a data storage device, database or hardware computing device with processors and memory. The stroke assessment system further comprises a number of machine learning module; which are mortality prediction module 105, ICD-9 code prediction module 106, treatment module 107 and LVO prediction module 108. These modules are configured to receive the data from\n\ndata collection module 104.\n\n25\n\n[0031] Usually, the data collection module 104 is configured to receive the data from\n\none or more data sources. The received data may be saved in the data storage device, database or hardware computing device as an unstructured data set. For the structured data element 101, textural data element 102, and image data element 103, a unique key or ID is required to identify each individual record or patient\u2019s information. This unique key or ID is also used to make sure the data can be merged and synchronized correctly.\n\n30\n\nIn general, the unique key or ID may include record key, episode key, and patient key\n\nDocket No. UM1104HK00\n\n6\n\nHK 30057394 A", "type": "Document"}}
