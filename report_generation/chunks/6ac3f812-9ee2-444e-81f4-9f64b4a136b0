The low-level states (ROIs) are shared among the high-level states. Taking the preference decision-making task as an example, it was assumed that participants have two cognitive states: an exploration period that involves information sampling without preference to a specific stimulus, and a preference-biased period where preference is formed and eye movement behavior can be influenced by the preference. A simplified decision process was assumed where a participant started in the exploration period, and that once the participant had sampled enough information in the exploration period, they transitioned to the preterence-biased period and could not transition back to the exploration period. That is, once the preference-biased period was entered it could not be exited until the response decision. To examine a gaze cascade effect, that is a gaze bias towards the later-selected object (see, e.g., Shimojo et al. 2003), it was assumed that the low-level HMM had two ROIs, each corresponded to a stimulus for choice. FIGURE 6 illustrates an example model summarizing a participant\u2019s eye movement pattern. As shown in the figure, the high-level HMM consisted of two cognitive states as its hidden states: exploration and preference-biased periods. The blue arrows indicate the transitions between the two states, and the numbers indicate transition probabilities. Eye movements within each state were modeled with a low-level HMM, whose hidden states represent ROIs of eye movements. The red arrows represent transitions between ROIs. The two cognitive states have the same ROIs but different\n\ntransition probabilities.\n\nEXAMPLE 8\u2014Training individual SHMMs", "type": "Document"}}
