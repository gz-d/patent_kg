Each subarray is subjected to a respective bias voltage. By adjusting the bias voltages to the different subarrays, potential device mismatch in different subarrays can be compensated for broadside radiation. Also, yy tuning the bias voltages, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation (e.g., beam) radiated by the array may be steered. in some embodiments, as the free-running frequency of the peripheral oscillators (-gm cells) may substantially influ- ence the steady-state phase relationship, the radiation direc- tion in the H-plane can be controlled by tuning the bias\n\nvoltage Vg, and/or Vg.\n\n[0145] FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate a 1x2 unit cell 400 in the 12x12 coupled oscillator array 300 in FIG. 3A in one embodiment of the invention. The 1x2 unit cell may be considered as a radiator unit whereas the 12x12 coupled oscillator array (with multiple 1x2 unit cells) may be con- sidered as a radiator (with multiple radiator units).\n\n[0146] The unit cell 400 generally includes an oscillator arrangement operable to generate third harmonic power, and a patch antenna arrangement operably coupled with the oscillator arrangement for radiating terahertz electromag- netic radiation based on the generated third harmonic power.\n\n[0147] In this embodiment, the unit cell 400 includes two oscillators each operable to generate third harmonic power. Each of the two oscillators respectively comprises a tran- sistor arrangement 402A, 402B. The construction of the two oscillators are generally the same so for simplicity the following only describes the construction of the oscillator with the transistor arrangement 402A in greater detail.", "type": "Document"}}
