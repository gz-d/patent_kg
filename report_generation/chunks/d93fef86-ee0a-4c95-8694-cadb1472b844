The feed network is operably connected with the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna for feeding an electrical signal from the feed source to the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna so as to form an electric dipole at the planar dipole antenna and a magnetic dipole at the loop antenna. The planar dipole antenna, the loop antenna and/or the feed network may be formed by conductive strips (e.g., Copper strips). The loop antenna need not be in the form of a closed loop, but can be a loop-like antenna with opposite ends close to each other but spaced apart. The loop antenna is preferably a single- loop antenna. The planar complementary antenna may be\n\n[0017] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the second conductive strip is connected directly across the antenna.\n\n[0018] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the network comprises a differential feed network.\n\n[0019] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the differ- feed network is arranged on a second side of substrate, wherein the second side is opposite the first\n\n[0020] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the differ- ential feed network comprises two input portions each arranged to receive a respective input signal, the two input signals being out of phase.\n\n[0021] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the planar complementary antenna further includes a ground plane arranged on the first side of the substrate.\n\n[0004] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna are both arranged on a first side of the substrate. Alternatively, the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna are arranged on opposite sides of the substrate.", "type": "Document"}}
