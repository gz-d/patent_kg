PTFE is a promising electret material with high negative charge storage capability and robust stability. Such superior performances can be preserved through continuous droplet impinging (left) or ion-injection (right). The charge loaded by droplet impinging is from the contact electrification between the PTFE and water. Moreover, the negative charges on the PFFE film can be also be enhanced by the ion-injection, which is conducted by utilizing a commercial antistatic gun (Zerostat3, Milty) to inject various ions including CO,~, NO,~, NO,~, O,~, and O,~ from a vertical distance of ~5 cms.\n\n[0031] FIG. 3c is a graph showing time-dependent varia- tion of the transferred charge Q generated on TIDE-G by an impinging droplet, indicating that the charge can be fully go back to zero when the TIDE-G transits to the switching-off mode. Cyclic measurements show the superior reversibility in the charge transfer. Notably, the amount of charge trans- ferred between the source and drain in each cycle is con- stant, a signature that there is no additional charge supply from PTFE or water, although the charge transfer or elec- tricity generation is gated by the soft, configurable water droplet.\n\n[0032] FIG. 3d is a graph showing distinct contrast in the measured maximum charge Q,,,,,. generated by an impacting droplet on TIDE-G and control sample under different We or maximum droplet spreading area, suggesting that the enhanced electricity generation is regulated by the elegant interplay between the impinging droplet and the unique configuration of the TIDE-G, rather than originating from the interfacial contact electrification.", "type": "Document"}}
