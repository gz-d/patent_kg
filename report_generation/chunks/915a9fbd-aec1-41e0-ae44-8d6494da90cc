The captured microscopic images are processed using ImageJ (NIH) for obtaining the key parameters mentioned in this work such as the diameter of cells and nuclei, as well as the penetration Jength in microfluidic channels. The elastic moduli are computed by customized scripts of MATLAB 2017a (Math- Works, MA, USA) written by the inventors. On the other hand, the immunofluorescence images are captured by a confocal laser scanning microscope (ZEISS LSM 880). Fluorescence intensity of captured confocal images is mea- sured using ImageJ.\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nSimulation\n\nSimulation\n\nof the\n\nlaminar\n\nflow\n\n[0137] along a nucleus-containing microfluidic channel is conducted with COMSOL 5.2a (Burlington, Mass.). The pressure distribu- tion around a cell/nucleus with a size ranging from 6 hm to 20 hm at a defined position along the microfluidic channel is analyzed for the case under 1 kPa driving pressure. Briefly, the laminar flow physics is applied to compute the pressure distributions for situations that a cell/nucleus cap- tured in different positions of single confining microfluidic channels. Geometries of a cell/nucleus are directly built at different positions in COMSOL 5.2a. The driving fluid material is selected as water from the material library and the captured cell/nucleus is selected as a blank matter with related properties (density=1,110 kg/m?, dynamic viscos- ity=0.033 Pa's 40). Fine mesh is selected as the fluid dynamic type.
