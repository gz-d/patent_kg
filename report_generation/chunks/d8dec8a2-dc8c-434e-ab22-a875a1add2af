As shown in FIG . 5A , the PC\n\nmodified PC membrane 608 , with a diameter of 22 mm , into\n\nmembrane 202 that is successfully deposited with the gold\n\ntwo individual compartments 606A and 606B . Each of the\n\nnano - layer 204 may have a plurality of grain - like structures\n\nindividual compartments is connected to respective inlets for\n\n502 substantially uniformly distributed on the membrane ,\n\nretaining the solution directed therefrom . In this example ,\n\nresulting in a rough surface .\n\nthe compartment 606A is fluidly connected to inlet 604A\n\n[ 0070 ] The method may then proceed to step 402 where\n\nwhereas the compartment 606B is fluidly connected to inlet\n\nthe gold - coated membrane is modified with a coupling agent\n\n604B .\n\n206.

For example , a solution containing a\n\nof oligo - RNA for capturing the antigens of gastric cancer in\n\nthe sample solution . Details of fabricating the membrane\n\npredetermined amount of MCH may be spin coated on the\n\ngold nano - layer . The sulfhydryl group of MCH may then\n\nhave been discussed in the method 400 .\n\nUS 2021/0131995 Al\n\nMay 6, 2021\n\ngastric cancer. The oligo-RNA 208 may form a physical interaction with the antigen 112 when they are in close proximity or in contact with each other. Preferably, the oligo-RNA 208 may form at least one of the electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions or a complementary shape with the antigen 112. By this capturing process, the amount of the antigen in the sample solution would be reduced, thereby altering the conductivity of the sample solution and the amount of current flow from the sample solution to the reference solution in the electrochemical detector 100.\n\nAny excess (ie. unreacted) MCH may be removed by washing the membrane surface with suitable solvents.", "type": "Document"}}
