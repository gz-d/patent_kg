FIG. 1B shows the related even and odd mode equivalent circuits based on T-network equivalent circuit of a two-port network. Accordingly, it can be deduced that:\n\nZe+Zo (6) = 2\n\nLZ.-Z, 7 t= 2% 0\n\n[0138] Further, equations (4) and (5) can be rewritten using even and odd mode impedances as follows:\n\nVi Zot Zo\\Zr + 2ZZo (3) \u4e94 (Ze- 2.21,\n\n2 ~ (Zot Lohr @) 8 Ze + Zo +2Z,\n\n[0139] By shorting the even-mode impedance (Z,=0), the voltage relationship of equation (8) equals -1 regardless of Z,. This corresponds to the out-of-phase coupling mode. Assuming the two cores are identical, the impedance rela- tionship in equation (9) is reduced to Z,=Z,=\u2014-Z 9. This condition can be used to determine the oscillation frequency and oscillation amplitude. Similarly, by shorting the odd- mode impedance (Z,=0), V,/V.=1. This corresponds to the\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nin-phase coupling mode. Assuming the two cores are iden- tical, the impedance relationship in equation (9) is reduced Z=Z,=-Z,.\n\nto\n\nBased on the above findings, a 2D scalable coupled oscillator array with desired operation mode can be formed.\n\n[0140]", "type": "Document"}}
