In a preferred embodiment it may only be necessary for the look up table to relate each quantization point to a respec- tive upper boundary, rather than both upper and lower bound- aries. In the look up process, the value of each coefficient f,,* may be iteratively compared with the upper boundaries of quantization points and when said upper boundary is greater than said coefficient, the coefficient f,,* can be assigned a quantized value z,, and an inverse quantized value f,,* corre- sponding to the quantization sub-zone having that upper bounday. The quantized value may be stored in a look up table or based on the number of comparisons made. The inverse quantized value may be stored in the look up table or found by multiplying the quantized value with a quantization param- eter A,, which may be stored in the look up table. The quan- tization parameter A,, may have different values for different i,j positions. In this way the Q and Qv! operations can be\n\nA first aspect of the present invention provides a method for calculating the sum of squared differences between an origi- block S and a reconstructed block R of image or video data, the method comprising the steps of:\n\na) computing a predicted block P corresponding to block S, using inter or intra frame prediction;\n\nb) calculating a residual block D from the original block the predicted block P, said residual block D having plurality of coefficients;\n\nc) applying an integer image transform to the coefficients of the residual block D so as to obtain a transformed residual block F*, said transformed residual block having a plurality of coefficients f,,*;\n\nd) finding a plurality of coefficients f,,* \"the coefficients i being defined by the equation QQ )), where Q is an operator which performs quantizing and Q is the inverse of Q operator; and", "type": "Document"}}
