Then, for each segment in a trial, the probability of time that the participant was in the preference-biased period was calculated. For each participant, the mean probability was calculated across all trials for each segment. Finally, the means across participants in the same group were averaged and the mean probability at each trial segment was plotted for the two participant groups separately. The plot represented the percentage of time at each trial segment the participants were in the preference-biased period. This examination allowed the detection of the difference in temporal dynamics of cognitive state changes ln a trial between groups.\n\n] >\n\nThe number of fixations ln the exploration and preference-biased period between the two groups were also examined. To this end, for each trial and each participant, the posterior probabilities of all high-level state sequences were computed, and then the numbers of fixations in the exploration and preference-biased periods counted. The aggregated probabilities over all trials and all high-level sequences were then used to form a probability distribution of number of fixations in each high-level state for a participant. The participants\u2019 probability distributions were then averaged together in each group.\n\n20 EXAMPLE 11\u2014Inferences of individual preferences\n\n25\n\n30\n\nIt was examined whether SHMMs could be used to infer an individual\u2019s preference", "type": "Document"}}
