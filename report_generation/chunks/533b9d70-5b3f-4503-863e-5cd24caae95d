As shown in the illustrated configuration of FIG. 7, the device 700 comprises a first flexible substrate 702 and a second flexible substrate 703. The first substrate 702 supports the p type semiconductor element 712. The second substrate 703 supports the n type semiconductor element 714. The first and second flexible substrates may be identical to each other in material, size and shape. Each flexible substrate 702, 703 is a rectangular sheet of polyimide material. Alternatively, the first and second substrate may comprise comprises Polyimide or Polyethylene Terephtha- late (PET), Polycarbonate, Polypropylene, Polyethylene, Polyvinyl chloride(PVC). Each substrate may be flexible such that it can be bent or wrapped around a pipe.\n\n[0179] FIG. 8A shows a plot 800 of electrical pulses detected in response to a series of touches detected on the thermoelectric device i.e. touch sensor 700. The plot may be generated on a scope during testing of the touch sensor 700. FIG. 8A illustrates a plurality of pulses 810 which corre- spond to multiple detected touches. As seen in FIG. 8A each pulse represents a unique detected touch. Each pulse is a current pulse that is detected by the sensor i.e. each pulse is generated representing a detected touch. A unique touch represents the sensor 700 being touched and the finger being removed. Each current pulse is generated due to the body heat from the finger and due to a temperature difference created across the sensor by the finger touch. When the finger is removed the current drops to zero. FIG. 8A shows detected finger touches over 60 seconds. The rise and fall time of each electrical pulse is 150 ms and 200 ms respec- tively.", "type": "Document"}}
