In other words, the metalens pair is turned in the opposite direction by the same angle o while keeping their sum (or \u4e2d ) constant. FIG. 16(@) shows the three defined coordinate systems and their geometric relationships for focus radial steering by synchronous counter rotation of the metalens doublet. Two extremes are firstly considered. When the phase progressions of the two metalenses are in the oppose direction (i.e., @=90\u00b0 as denoted by the x,,- and and x,,-axes in FIG. 16(a)), the focal point will be at the origin. When the phase progressions of the two metalenses are aligned in the same direction (ie., a\u20140\u00b0 as indicated by the xri- and x,>-axes in FIG. 16(a)), maximum focus steering occurs. As a result, by reducing the value of o from 90\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 (ie., anticlockwise rotating Metalens #1 and clockwise rotating Metalens #2 by the same angle \u00ab), the focus can be tuned radially in the focal plane. In order to verify its radial focus-steering capability, the synthesized metalens doublet was modeled and simulated in a full-wave electromagnetic simulator Ansys HFSS. Without loss of generality, the metalens pair is in-plane rotated to scan its focus along the yc-axis of the global coordinate system (i.e., y=90\u00b0). FIG. 16(c), (d) plots the orientations of the metalens pair and their corresponding simulated power densities on the focal plane when a=90\u00b0, 67.5\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 0\u00b0, respectively. The positions of the foci and their corresponding rotation\n\nangles are listed in Table IV.\n\nTABLE IV\n\nFocal positions and rotation angles for metalens focus radial steering.
