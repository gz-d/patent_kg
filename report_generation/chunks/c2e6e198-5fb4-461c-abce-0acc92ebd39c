In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna further facilitates the spatial- and time-varying wave properties, which enable generation of more complicated. waveform, beamforming, direct information manipulations, etc. In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna can generate non-diffractive Airy and near-field focusing beams. In some embodiments, the universal meta- surface antenna can directly generate the modulated waves carrying information that can fundamentally simplify the architecture of information transmitter systems. In some embodiments, the complicated waves and information manipulations by the metasurface antenna are achieved via spatiotemporally switching the ON-OFF coding states of meta-atoms of the metasurface structure of the antenna. In some embodiments, the metasurface antenna has versatile and robust EM wave and information manipulation capa- bilities, and may be applied in various applications such as next-generation information systems, cognitive sensing, and imaging to quantum optics and quantum information sci- ence.\n\nhave one\n\nSome embodiments of the invention\n\n[0202]", "type": "Document"}}
