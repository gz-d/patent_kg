In some examples, the transmission line arrangement may comprise, or consist only of, a transmission line. In some examples, the transmission line may be straight. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement may comprise, or consist only of, a capacitor. In some examples, the transmission line has a length, and the capacitor is electrically connected at or near a middle of the length of the transmission line. In some examples, the even-mode-shorted coupler is electrically connected either (i) between the gate terminals of the first and second transistors of the second oscillator of the first radiator unit\n\nand the gate terminals of the first and second transistors of\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nthe first oscillator of the second radiator\n\nbetween.\n\nunit, or (ii) the gate terminals of the first and second transistors of the first oscillator of the first radiator unit and the gate terminals of the first and second transistors of the second oscillator the second radiator unit.\n\nof\n\n[0040] In some embodiments, the plurality of radiator units comprises, at least, a first radiator unit and a second. radiator unit arranged in adjacent rows, and the radiator comprises a coupling arrangement electrically coupling the first radiator unit and the second radiator unit in adjacent rows.", "type": "Document"}}
