Since the DR is transparent, it can let\n\nlight pass through itself and, thus, the light can be utilized by\n\nUS 8,547,287 B2\n\n14\n\n13\n\nan optical part of a system or device. The transparent DR can be placed on top of a solar cell. Since the DR does not block the light, the light can reach the solar cell and power can be generated for the system or device. The system or device so obtained is very compact because no extra footprint is needed within the system or device for the DRA. It finds application in compact wireless applications that need a self-sustaining power device.\n\nwherein said power generating device is located such that impinging upon said device travels through at least a part the DR of the DRA.\n\nIn the foregoing preferred embodiments, the DR may be a DR ofa dielectric resonator antenna (DRA), said DRA com- prising one ofa plurality of DRAs arranged ina DRA array or DRA reflect-array. An antenna array is a matrix of antennas used to increase the gain of an antenna system.\n\nWhile the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only exemplary embodiments have been shown and described and do not limit the scope of the invention in any manner. It can be appreciated that any of the features described herein may be used with any embodiment. The illustrative embodiments are not exclusive of each other or of other embodiments not recited herein. Accordingly, the invention also provides embodiments that comprise combi- nations of one or more of the illustrative embodiments lescribed above. Modifications and variations of the inven- tion as herein set forth can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and, therefore, only such limita- tions should be imposed as are indicated by the appended. claims.", "type": "Document"}}
