The obtained slurry was pasted onto an Al foil and dried at 80\u00b0 C. for 12 h ina vacuum oven, and thereby the (pristine) BHT-BQ-COF- based anode is obtained.\n\n[0082] The obtained (pristine) BHT-BQ-COF-based anode was combined with a Na electrode to fabricate a half cell battery. After performing a discharging process at 50 mA gl for about 10 hours, the cell was disassembled in the glovebox to isolate the presodiated BHT-BQ-COF-based electrode as the anode of the full cell.\n\nExample 8\n\nFabrication of the Half SIB Coin Cell with the BHT-BQ-COF-Based Anode\n\n[0083] An o-ring was placed on a smaller cap and pressed against the case. Next, a spring, a stainless steel spacer and\n\nMar. 7, 2024\n\nthe (pristine) BHT-BQ-COF-based anode obtained in Example 7 were placed on the o-ring sequentially, with the cast film of the anode facing upwards. After that, a separator (glass fiber) was placed on top of the anode as centered as possible. 200 pL of 1M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF,) in diglyme as the electrolyte was then dropped onto the separator. Next, a sodium disc cathode was placed on top, with the cast film facing the anode and centered as much as possible with the anode to avoid uneven current densities. Finally the larger case was placed on top and the coin cell was packed with 0.8 kPa pressure.\n\nExample 9\n\nElectrochemical Performance of Half SIB Coin Cell with the BHT-BQ-COF-Based Anode\n\n[0084] Coin cells of CR2032, assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (O,<0.1 ppm, H,Os0.1 ppm), were used to inves- tigate the electrochemical performance of the BHT-BQ- COF//Na half-cell SIBs.", "type": "Document"}}
