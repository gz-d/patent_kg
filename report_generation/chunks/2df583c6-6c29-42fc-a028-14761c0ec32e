The disclosed subject matter also is relatively inexpensive and thus is a cost effective solution for processing and presenting 2-D and 3-D content. Further, the barrier control component 110 can con- sume a relatively low amount of power during operation and thus can be a cost effective and power efficient solution for\n\nFIG. 2 depicts a diagram ofan example system 200 that can employ respective optical signals to facilitate controlling selection of respective barrier patterns to facilitate desirable display of multi-dimensional video content in accordance with various aspects and embodiments. In an aspect, the system 200 can include a projector screen component 202, barrier component 204, and barrier control component 206 that each can be the same as or similar to, and/or can comprise\n\nAs another example, if the video content is enhanced 2-D content (e.g., autostereoscopically enhanced 2-D content) that can be converted to 3-D autostereoscopic content, the selected barrier pattern mode (and selected barrier pattern) be an autostereoscopic-type barrier pattern mode,\n\nmode).
