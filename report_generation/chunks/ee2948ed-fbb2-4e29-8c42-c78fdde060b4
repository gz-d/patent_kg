Devices for controlling propagation of electromagnetic radiation can form important components in many electronic and optical devices. For example, modulators are used in optical fiber systems for modulating an intensity ofa carrier signal in order to generate an encoded signal. Modulators can also form important components in photonic integrated circuits (\u201cPICs\u201d) that include electronic devices and optoelectronic devices. PICs are the photonic equivalent of electronic inte- grated circuits and may be implemented on a semiconductor substrate that forms the base of the electronic and optoelec- tronic devices. As one example, a modulator can be used to modulate an optical signal that is communicated between different electronic devices or different functional circuitry on the same substrate. DR form important component parts of optical fiber systems, PICs and other electronic devices and. systems. The reference to a DR according to the invention hereinbefore described with reference to the drawings is to be taken as a reference to such DR being incorporated into circuits for optical fiber systems, PICs and other electronic\n\nIn the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention, except where the context requires otherwise lue to express language or necessary implication, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d or variations such as \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccompris- ing\u201d is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.\n\nIt is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other coun- try.\n\nThe invention claimed is:", "type": "Document"}}
