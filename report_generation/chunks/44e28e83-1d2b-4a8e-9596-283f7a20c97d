Therefore, in this tier, NOAEC of the agent on teleost is determined. The pre- ferred stage of embryos to be examined is 24 or 48 hpf.\n\nIn the third tier, it will be determined whether the agent at the level of NOAEC, instead of gross abnormalities, will induce any adverse effect at the organ level and cellular level. Therefore, safety of an agent will be evaluated by mean of a cytotoxicity test, organ toxicity test and cardiotoxicity test. In addition, angiogenic modulating activity will be tested at NOAEC. In this tier, visualization of intersegmental vessels is by microangiography imaging technology in which fluores- cent dye, e.g. fluorescent microbead or fluorescent dextrans, are injected into the blood circulation such that it will be diffused to all registered blood vessels by blood circulation. Alteration of intersegmental vessels will be an indicator for angiogenic modulating activity. Agent with any positive results in one of the test or negative results in angiogenic modulating activity will be discarded. Otherwise, it will be considered as safe with angiogenic modulating activity.", "type": "Document"}}
