Taking C;C, for example, it represents the synthesized video subset were synthesized from the texture and depth videos with compression distortions. The subjective experiment was conducted by single stimulus paradigm with continuous score. Difference Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS) were provided. The parameter settings in the SR-3DVQA method of the one embodiment are as follows: the dictionary size is 64256, the sparsity ge for training and testing are both 6, the patch size in the temporal layer is 8x8, the layer size h, is 8, the patch variance threshold g is 5, the edge number threshold B is 1, the canny threshold is set as 0.2, and the dilation mask is 2x2.\n\nD.
