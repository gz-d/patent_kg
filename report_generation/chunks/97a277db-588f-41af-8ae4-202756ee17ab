The second harmonic current first decreases to near zero and then rises under high |Vz_fjl. The generated second harmonic current from the active and cut-off transition is out of phase with the second harmonic current from the active and triode regions transition. Therefore, the second har- monic current output is reduced to a small or minimal value. When the transistor is driven into the deep triode region, the second harmonic current continues to increase. In this example, it can be found that the third harmonic current always increases with |V,_f,|, because both transitions can contribute to third harmonic current generation.\n\n[0175] The large harmonic current at the transistor drain can induce harmonic voltage if a resistive harmonic load is terminated for harmonic power extraction. The induced harmonic voltage can change the depth of the triode region. Therefore, the harmonic voltage at the drain can also change the harmonic current output. In one example, to study the effect of second and third harmonic voltages on the output current, the second and third harmonic voltages are respec- tively applied at the transistor drain with the correct phase, to ensure the transistor output second and third harmonic power to a resistive load.
