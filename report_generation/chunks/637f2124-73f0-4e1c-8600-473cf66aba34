This result nicely demonstrated the remarkable configur- ability of CECE via elastic deformation. To assess the lifespan of the elastic crack, one PDMS mold was used to repeatedly replicate an arch structure for cycles (FIG. 3C). Notably, the structure obtained after 50\u201d cycles is still exactly identical with the master (FIG. 11A-11D), demon- strating the superior robustness of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 3D and 3E, with CECE to the present invention enables creation of structures with nanoscale beams and gaps, even down to 280 nm and 80 nm, respec- tively. Finally, a microbull (FIG. 3F), representing the most complicated arbitrary 3D structures producible using state- of-art techniques, can also be faithfully replicated, revealing the unprecedented capability of CECE and its full compat- ibility to initial prototyping techniques. Table 1 summarizes a detailed comparison of characteristics between CECE and. other fabrication methods. Taken together, it is clear that CECE is a unique technique for efficient and scalable\n\nof CECE, a variety of representative 3D hierarchical struc- tures were further replicated (i.e., a beaded probe, a helix, an arch, a multi-beam, a split-ring, and a bull), resembling those emerging architectures with promising functions. The masters of these structures (FIG. 3B-3G) were fabricated using prototyping methods that are expensive, time-consum- ing, and low throughput. These 3D hierarchical structure structures have been proven challenging for replication using existing methods, owing to the presence of multiple pronged nanoscale shapes (i.e., closed loop, reentrant, high- aspect-ratio rods, and 3D arrays).
