Each of the plurality of sections and the respective arc- shaped patch may be connected through a respective via (i.e., via hole) that extends through the first and second substrate layers. Preferably, the plurality of arc-shaped patches are angularly spaced apart evenly.\n\nwith the substrate assembly of FIG. 2A when connected first port (TE port) with a signal source;\n\n[0037] FIG. 4B is a graph showing a second radiation pattern (E-plane and H-plane, measured and simulated, at 2.44 GHz) produced by the dielectric resonator antenna prototype with the substrate assembly of FIG. 2A when connected at a second port (TM port) with a signal source;\n\n[0022] Preferably, the dielectric resonator element is a solid element. The dielectric resonator element may take different form and shape, and it may be in the form of a decorative object or a functional object (e.g., light cover, mirror, decoration). The dielectric resonator element may be substantially transparent, or translucent. The dielectric reso- nator element may be optically-transparent. Light may pass through the dielectric resonator element. The dielectric resonator element can be made from various dielectric materials, including K9 optical glass.\n\n[0038] FIG. 5 is a graph showing the measured simulated realized antenna gain of the dielectric resonator antenna prototype with the substrate assembly of FIG. 2A; and\n\n[0039] FIG. 6 is a graph showing the measured antenna efliciency of the dielectric resonator antenna prototype with substrate assembly of FIG. 2A.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\n\n[0023] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the dielectric resonator element and the substrate assembly have the same cross section or the same cross sectional shape (but different size).", "type": "Document"}}
