The filter-antenna 20 is oper- ably connected with a signal (e.g., energy) source 10 such as a power amplifier to receive a signal (e.g., energy) from the signal source 10. The filter-antenna 20 includes a bandpass channel 22BP and a band-stop channel 22BS. The bandpass channel 22BP is connected with an antenna element 24. The band-stop channel 22BS is connected with a filter element 26 illustrated as a resistor. The energy in the passband received at the bandpass channel 22BP is transmitted to the antenna element 24; the energy in the stopband received at the band-stop channel 22BS is absorbed or dissipated by the resistor 26. Thus, the energy reflection in both the passband and the stopband is reduced, minimized, and preferably substantially eliminated, to avoid possible detrimental effects on neighboring components (e.g., the power ampli- fier).\n\n[0024] In one embodiment of the third aspect, integrating absorptive filter comprises forming a hole in the sub- strate for receiving a filter element of the absorptive filter. Integrating the absorptive filter may further include arrang- the filter element of the absorptive filter in the hole.\n\n[0025] In one embodiment of the third aspect, arranging the filter element of the absorptive filter in the hole com- prises arranging the filter element of the absorptive filter arranged substantially completely in the hole.\n\n[0026] In one embodiment of the third aspect, the method further comprises forming an electric connection between the filter element and the ground plane and an electric connection between the filter element and the microstrip network. Forming the electric connection may include weld- ing or soldering.", "type": "Document"}}
