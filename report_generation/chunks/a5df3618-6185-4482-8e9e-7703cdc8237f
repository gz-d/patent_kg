Negative controls with no NAD +\n\nSirtuins , including Sirt1 , Sirt2 , Sirt3 , Sirts , and Sirt6 , were\n\nrecombinantly expressed and purified . Pyruvate dehydroge\n\nor no Sirt2 were included as well . Comparing with the\n\ncontrol groups , a substantial reduction was observed in the\n\nnase E2 ( DLAT ) ( NM_001931 ) human recombinant protein\n\nKlip level for DLAT treated with Sirt2 in the presence of\n\nwas sourced from ORIGENE . Streptavidin magnetic beads\n\nwere purchased from New England Biolabs . In - gel fluores\n\nNAD + .\n\ncence scanning experiments were performed with a FLA\n\n[ 0089 ] These results indicated that Sirt2 has delipoylation\n\nactivity toward DLAT protein .\n\n9000 Fujifilm scanner . Antibody of Sirt2 ( D4S6J ) was from\n\nCell Signaling .

Lipoylated PDH is responsible for converting\n\nfrom Merck Millipore . Western blotting was carried out with\n\npyruvate into acetyl - CoA , a central metabolite that enters\n\na C600 Azure biosystem . Sirt2 siRNA ( AM16708 ) was from\n\ninto the TCA cycle .
