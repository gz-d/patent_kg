In some embodiments, a mathematic model is used to characterize the relationship between the magnetic field and current. A current-field map (i.e., values of magnetic flux density in different coordinates under different current) in the work- space for each coil can be built. Therefore, eight current- field maps can be created when the system includes eight coils. Then, by setting the zero-field point in the specific coordinate, the required values of current used in the eight coils can be determined accordingly. Using the determined.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nMagnetic flux density and magnetic field gradient for workspace of 160 mm and 100 mm respectively under the second magnetic actuation mode with reference FIG. 12A.
