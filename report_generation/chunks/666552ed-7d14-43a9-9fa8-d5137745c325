A reasonable agreement between them can be observed. With reference to FIG. 3, the mea- sured and simulated 10-dB impedance bandwidths (S,, 10 dB) of the dielectric resonator antenna are 10.06% (2.36-2.61 GHz) and 7.32% (2.37-2.55 GHz) respectively. This covers the entire 2.4-GHz ISM band (2.40-2.48 GHz). A0.018 GHz (0.73%) frequency shift between the measured (2.451 GHz) and simulated (2.469 GHz) resonant frequen- cies of the dielectric resonator antenna is observed. This frequency shift may be caused by experimental tolerances including machining errors and possible air gaps between A\n\nnator antenna on the dielectric resonator antenna, a reference solid dielectric resonator antenna having the same dimen- sions as the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2 is considered. The reference dielectric resonator antenna is also excited in the TEL mode. It was found that the reference dielectric resonator antenna also resonates at 2.45 GHz when its dielectric constant E equals 10.6, which is slightly larger than that of the current dielectric resonator antenna (\u00a2,=10). This means that in practice the integration of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna does not increase the volume of the antenna. For ease of comparison, the simu- lated reflection coeflicients of the reference dielectric reso- nator antenna are also illustrated in FIG. 3. It can be seen that the simulated reflection coefficient of the reference dielectric resonator antenna almost overlaps that of the dielectric\n\n[0045] A dual-fed dual-frequency antenna that covers 2.4 GHz and 24 GHz ISM bands was designed using ANSYS HESS based on the antenna configuration of FIGS. 1A to 1C.
