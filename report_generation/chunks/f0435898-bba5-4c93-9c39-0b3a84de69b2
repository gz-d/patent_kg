The compensator circuit 122 is arranged to generate a compensa- tion signal v,,,,,,, based on said difference level signal and to apply said compensation signal v,,,,,,,, to said capacitor 118. In this example, the compensation signal is provided by a linear- type voltage source 124 of the compensator circuit 122 con- nected in series with the capacitor 118. Application of the compensation signal to the capacitor 118 results in a compen- sated output voltage signal v,,. The compensation signal v,,,,,, as illustrated in FIG. 3c is an inverse of the output voltage signal v, minus the reference signal v,,-namely:\n\nIn the absence of any application of a compensation signal To, from the conypensator circuit 222, the current regulator 210 of FIG. 4 will have an output current signal i,' that generally tracks the constant level of the reference current signal I,,. However, due to the operation of the inductor 226 and/or other circuit effects, a ripple current signal is often present in the output current signal i,,in an analogous manner to that illustrated in FIG. 3b. The presence of the ripple current signal is undesirable.\n\nYeomp\u2014VrefYo\n\nIt will be understood by one skilled in the art that, although the compensation signal v,,,,,,,, is described as being provided by a linear-type voltage source, any suitable voltage source can be utilized or, in some examples, a current source may be employed.\n\nIn the improved voltage regulator arrangement of FIG. 2, the controller stage 116 senses the compensated output volt-\n\nThe compensator circuit 222 is arranged to derive a differ- ence level signal from the comparison of the reference current\n\nthose lator by The\n\n110 of FIG. 2\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nof the", "type": "Document"}}
