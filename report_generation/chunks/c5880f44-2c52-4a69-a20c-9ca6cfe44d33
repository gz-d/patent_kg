Broad- side patterns can be observed for both E- and H-planes, as expected, and co-polarized fields 1206 (1306) are stronger than their cross-polarized 1208 (1308) counterparts by at least 20 Decibel (dB) in the boresight direction (@-0\u00b0). Note further that the simulated 1202 E-plane cross-polarized field is too minute to observe in FIG. 12.\n\ninstance, according an aspect, one or more mal overlaid solar cell(s) 704 can include coating or overlay 802, for example, that can be a metallic wire grid. As a further example, coating or overlay 802 can include a metallic wire grid having grid size of d 804. It can be understood that a coating or overlay 802 comprising a metallic wire grid having grid size of d 804 can strongly reflect a microwave signal over a frequency range of f,<fsf,, when the grid size 804 is less than 1/(10 f,,). Thus, according to a further aspect, coating or overlay 802 can be selected such that grid size or other physi- cal properties can maximize reflection of incident radiation of interest (e.g., wireless communications carrier signal such as a microwave signal), while maximizing solar generation\n\nFIG. 14 illustrates a top view of a non-limiting one-to-three way Wilkinson power divider 1400 suitable for use with exemplary implementations of the disclosed subject matter. For instance, to feed exemplary non-limiting single-element 102 SPA of various implementations of the disclosed subject matter (e.g., GA 300, GA 500, GA 700, etc.), a plurality of conventional one-to-three way Wilkinson power dividers can be fabricated or otherwise obtained and cascaded.
