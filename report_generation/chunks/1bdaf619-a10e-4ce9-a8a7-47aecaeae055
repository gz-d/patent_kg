This effect is shown in \"Controlled release of vancomycin from thin sol-gel films on titanium alloy fracture plate material\" by S. Radin et al. (Biomaterials 2007;28(9):1721-1729) and \"In vivo tissue response to resorbable silica xerogels as controlled-release materials\" by S. Radin et al. (Bio- materials 2005;26(9):1043-1052). Accordingly, the re- lease rate of the antibiotic is difficult to control with the use of existing techniques. Clinically, deep wound infec- tion occurring after period of operation is not uncommonly seen. The conventional antibiotics coating is not able to tackle this complication due to the degradation over time of the antibiotics. The unprotected surface of the implant is then exposed to the invading bacteria. Moreover, the uncontrollable release of the antibiotics may occur in ex- cess and thus spoil the normal function of the peripheral cells. [0005] Thus, there continues to exist a need in the art for implantable biomaterials with surface antimicrobial properties.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
