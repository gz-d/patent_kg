In accor- dance other embodiments, the barrier control component 110 can be a stand-alone unit, which can be adhered, attached, or placed in proximity to the barrier component 108 such that the barrier control component 110 is aligned with the control region 112 of the projector screen component 102, and asso- ciated visual images 104, so that the barrier control compo- nent 110 can detect the signals (e.g., optical signals) commu- nicated (e.g., presented, emitted) by or from the control region 112.", "type": "Document"}}
