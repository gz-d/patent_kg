Patch clamp allows for the direct and real-time monitoring of ion channel activity in the administration of testing compounds in whole-cell mode. However, it is a low-throughput methodology and requires highly skillful operators. Although other advanced screening technologies have been developed recently to improve the degree of throughput, all these technologies are based on in vitro cell culture models. The disadvantage of using in vitro model is that complex physiological environment that occurs in vivo cannot be modeled in an in vitro system. Some biological questions of cardiac electrophysiology can- not simply be addressed by in vitro assays. In this case, in vivo models have been applied, including Guinea pig, dog, and primate. ECG is continuously recorded over a range of increasing doses in anaesthetized animal to detect the occur- rence of any cardiac arrhythmia. Moreover, they are not widely used due to the ethical issues and cost efficiency. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new technology with\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates to a method of using a teleost as model to screen agents for cardiotoxic effect, particularly alteration in heart rate and in heart beat rhythm. Teleosts, either embryos or larvae, are bathed in medium containing testing agents for a particular period of time. Then, the teleost is immobilized by agarose, agar or methyl-cellulose. Circulation of blood cells are videoed under microscope equipped with digital camera connected to a recording device, such as a VCR recorder, digital video camera or Video of blood circulation is then\n\nCardiac\n\nof conditions in which the\n\nmia has been issued (Stockbridge and Throckmorton. 2004).\n\nCellular electrophysiological basis for cardiac arrhythmia\n\nexperimental models (Joshi et al. 2004).
