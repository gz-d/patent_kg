However, the clustering results showed that this difference was more obvious for one group of participants (group A) than the other group (group B). To visualize the difference in the gaze cascade effect between the two participant groups, a gaze cascade plot was generated. The plot showed the probability that participants looked at the image to be chosen during the last 2.5 seconds prior to the response.
