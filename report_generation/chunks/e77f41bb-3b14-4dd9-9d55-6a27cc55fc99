In one example, the metasurface antenna 400 can generate the EM waves with more complicated spatial-varying phase properties for Airy beam. The required phase profile along the metasurface antenna 400 should fulfill the following equation to generate a parabolic trajectory under the ray optics and paraxial approximation:\n\ntx) = fats (x? ao\n\nwhere a is the acceleration factor and &,, is the free-space wavenumber at the target mw%-order harmonic frequency. The corresponding theoretical trajectory is a parabolic caus- tic with x=az*. For the universal metasurface antenna 400, the phase distribution of the extracted wave at the m%-order harmonic frequency is the sum of the accumulated phase\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nshift of the guided wave and the equivalent phase shift imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation, given by \u4e2d cv Os7=\u2014G ow X- 20m yt (x) (FIG. 26).
