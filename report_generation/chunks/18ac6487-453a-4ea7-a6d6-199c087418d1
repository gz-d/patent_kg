This difference was not readily observable from group eye fixation heat maps, demonstrating the power of the EMHMM method (FIGURE 1c; Chan et al., 2018). Among older adults, holistic patterns were associated with lower cognitive status as assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA; Yeung, Wong, Chan, Leung, & Yung, 2014); particularly in executive function and visual attention abilities (as assessed by Tower of London (TOL) and Trail Making Tests). Interestingly, this association was replicated when models of the discovered common patterns were used to assess new participants\u2019 eye movement patterns when viewing new face images, suggesting the possibility of developing representative models from the population for cognitive impairment screening purposes.\n\nPrevious eye movement data analysis methods, including the use of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) or fixation heat map, did not take temporal information of eye movements into account and the use of predefined ROIs might have involved experimenter biases. Further, in these methods the analysis was typically performed on averaged or group data, and thus did not reflect individual differences in eye movement pattern. In addition, there was no quantitative measure of eye movement pattern similarity that took both spatial (eye fixation location) and temporal information (sequence of fixations) into account.", "type": "Document"}}
