The blend may be degassed to remove any air bubbles therein, facilitating the subsequent curing process. In this example, 0.358g of alginate (AR grade, Sigma-Aldrich) is added to the mixture under stirring until a clear blend solution is obtained. The solution may be degassed for 10 min by ultrasonication.\n\n[0201] Alternatively, the step of encapsulating the anode and the cathode may be performed simultaneously with the step of forming the electrolyte. In turn, the anode and the cathode would be encapsulated and wrapped inside the electrolyte upon the step of curing the blend.\n\n[0194] The as-obtained blend may be cured to form a hydrogel. The curing process may be performed at room temperature or a higher temperature to allow polymeriza- tion. The curing process may be carried in a glass mould. In this example, the degassed blend may be cured in a planar or column mold under UV radiation (360 nm) at room temperature for 2h in order to allow free radical polymer- ization of the PAAm chains as well as the polymerization between the TMSPMA and the PAAm chains.", "type": "Document"}}
