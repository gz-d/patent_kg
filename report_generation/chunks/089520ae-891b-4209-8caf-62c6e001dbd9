In this example embodiment, the photovol- taic element is a solar cell 14 arranged to convert light beam 30 into electrical power. Alternatively, the photovoltaic ele- ment may be a solar panel comprising a plurality of solar cells. The photovoltaic element may also be implemented as a solar module integrated to a circuit or a device in some embodiments. Alternatively, the solar radiation source is a lighting source powered by fuel or electrical power such as, but not limited to, in-house lighting apparatus, a gas light, street light. As the DR 16 is transparent, it does not deter the solar cell 14 from collecting sunlight, ambient light or any other light source 30. In addition, high compactness can be easily achieved by placing the solar cell 14 beneath the DR 16 in order to reduce or minimize the footprint occupied by the combined components. The DRA 12 comprises a dielectric resonator (DR) 16; a ground plane or grounded substrate 18 comprising a non-conductive substrate 17 and a conductive ground plane layer 19; and a strip feedline (conformal strip) 20 for exciting the DR 16. The conformal strip 20 is con- nected to a central conductor or coaxial probe 24 of a coaxial cable 22, although it will be understood that the conformal\n\nAlso disclosed herein in some embodiments is a transpar- ent dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) for optical applica- tions. Since the DRA is transparent, it can let light pass through itself and, thus, the light can be utilized by other optical or light receiving and/or light transmitting compo- nents of a system or device. As an example, the transparent DRA can be placed on top ofa solar cell. Since the DRA does not block the light, the light can reach the solar cell panel and power can be generated. The system so obtained is very compact because no or little extra footprint is needed for the\n\n2", "type": "Document"}}
