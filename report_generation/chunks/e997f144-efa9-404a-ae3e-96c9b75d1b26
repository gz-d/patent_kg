To\n\nmimic the experimental setup , rigid and smooth hydropho\n\nthe PTFE , the amount of charges on ITO ( positive ) is the\n\nbic atomic layers are used to represent the PTFE and\n\nsame as that of the PTFE ( negative ) because of the electro\n\nelectrode , respectively . 800 negative and 800 positive\n\nstatic induction .

When a water droplet leaves the PTFE surface\n\nafter impacting ( ii ) , it becomes positively charged while the\n\nthe atomic layers of PTFE and electrode , and each site was\n\ncharged te , as depicted in Extended Data FIG . 14.
