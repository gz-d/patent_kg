In another exemplary embodiment, the locking process can be induced remotely without the need for open surgery. For example, the locking process can be carried out by triggering shape change in a NiTi anchor member, such as through heating. In an exemplary em- bodiment, a heating device, such as an electromagnetic device, can be used to provide the heat. In one exemplary embodiment, the heating device can be applied to the skin in a close proximity to the NiTi anchor member. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the locking process are also within the scope of the present inven- tion. [0032] According to the present invention, at least one of the support member and the anchor member can be formed as a correction member. The correction member is capable of providing a constant or substantially con- stant correction force for correcting spinal deformities. The correction device so formed is thus capable of grad- ually and fully correcting spinal deformities without further manipulation of the correction member after the spinal correction surgery. [0033] If desired, the support member can be restricted from undesired movement or rotation. The restriction can be carried out in various manners. For example, one or", "type": "Document"}}
