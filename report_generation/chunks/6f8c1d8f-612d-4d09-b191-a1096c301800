Upon commencing the heating programs, the temperature in the first temperature zone 130a is raised from room temperature to about 200\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 200\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes; while the tempera- ture in the second temperature zone 1306 is raised from room temperature to 600-950\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 600-950\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes. The heating programs described herein will cause vaporization of the materials respectively housed in the first and second containers 120a, 1205 (e.g., sulfur powders, and ammonium perrhenate), the vaporized materials are subsequently deposited on the sur- face of the substrate 140 mounted in the second container 120b when the tube furnace, particularly, the second tem- perature zone 130h, is cooled, thereby forming the desired single-layer ReS,. According to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, the temperature in the first tempera- ture zone 130a is raised from room temperature to about 200\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 200\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes; while the temperature in the second temperature zone 130d is raised from room temperature to 850\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at 850\u00b0 C. for another 10 minutes. After the heating program, let the temperature in the second tempera- ture zone 1306 returns slowly and naturally to 600\u00b0 C., while the temperature of the tube furnace 100 returns quickly (Le within about 5 minutes) to room temperature, thereby result- ing the deposition of ReS, on the substrate 140. According to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, the thus deposited ReS, is highly crystalline and has a thickness about 0.7 nm, which indicates that the ReS, deposited by the\n\npresent method is in single-layer structure. Then, the substrate 140 having a single-layer of\n\n[0046]", "type": "Document"}}
