Such a sys- tem includes a charging platform or pad that generates verti- cal flux from the planar surface of the charging pad and at least in preferred embodiments the present invention addresses several basic principles for achieving localized charging in a charging pad system. Although these principles and corresponding techniques can be implemented individu- ally, their collective use is synergistic and enables the devel- opment of an inductive charging pad system that can meet\n\n(c) The possibility of human exposure to the transmitted energy from the charging pad due to physical contacts on the charging surface of the charging pad is either eliminated or at least reduced. This feature helps meeting the \u201cIEEE C95.1 standard for safety levels with respect to human exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz.\u201d", "type": "Document"}}
