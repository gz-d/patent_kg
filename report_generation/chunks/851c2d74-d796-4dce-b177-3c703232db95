[0008] The invention provides a method for the altering surface composition of a nickel titanium alloy part to increase biocompatibility, comprising implanting nitrogen or oxygen on the surface of the nickel titanium alloy part by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition, wherein the energy of the incident specimen used for surface treatment ranges from 500 eV to 100 keV for plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition. The nickel titanium alloy is preferably a shape memory alloy, and has a nickel content ranging from about 20-80% of nickel and 80-20% of titanium. The surface implantation of elements enhances the mechanical properties of the alloy, such as hydrophilicity, corrosion and wear resistance. The nickel titanium alloy part can be reduced or enhanced. In practicing the invention, the plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition or related ion-beam and plasma-based techniques such as plasma-enhanced vapor phase deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (VPD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can reduce, terminate or prevent the deleterious ions from being released from the substrate of the shape memory materials. The materials may be biomaterials used for orthopedics, urologics, vascular surgery, hepatobiliary surgery or esophageal surgery. The energy of the incident species used for surface treatment of the materials ranges from 500 eV to 100 keV for implantation and deposition. Preferably, the energy of the surface treatment of the materials ranges from 500 eV to 1000eV for implantation and deposition. The direct current is applied with the parameters 0 Hz repetition with \u2019infinite\u2019 pulse duration to 5000 Hz. The material implanted is a nitrogen source, a carbon source, or an oxygen source, gaseous, liquid, or solid form. The nitrogen source is nitrogen gas. The carbon source is acetylene or a derivative thereof. The oxygen source", "type": "Document"}}
