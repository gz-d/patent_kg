In specific embodiments, this model is applied to scene perception.\n\nIn some embodiments, an Eye Movement analysis with Switching Hidden Markov Model (EMSHMM) is provided to detect participant groups with consistent eye movement\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n6\n\npatters with cognitive state changes. The EMSHMM of the instant invention is particularly useful for tasks involving decision making where participants need to explore different options and decide which option they prefer; a process that involves at least two cognitive states: exploration and decision making.\n\nAlso provided are methods for determining a subject\u2019s perception style and cognitive abilities.", "type": "Document"}}
