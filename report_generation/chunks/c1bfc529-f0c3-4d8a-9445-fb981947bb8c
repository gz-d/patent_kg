Example circuit schematics are shown in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12. The use of a step-down transformer has the advantage that the DC-link voltage of the inverter can be set to a higher value so that the current injected into the capacitor and the primary winding of the transformer can be kept to a relatively low value. This facilitates the choice of components in the circuit by avoiding the need for components such as capacitors that are suitable for use with large currents.
