It should be noted, for example, that for maxi- mum efficiency, the secondary coil should be located in a plane such that when the device is placed on the charging surface, the secondary coil is parallel to the charging surface. This maximizes the magnetic flux passing through the sec- ondary coil and increases the efficiency of the energy transfer. For electrical devices that have at least one generally planar surface, for example, a mobile phone, this may be quite easy to achieve as the secondary coil may be positioned parallel to the planar surface such that the electrical device can simply be placed on the charging surface with the planar surface in contact with the charging surface. In this way, the secondary\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELAIED APPLICATIONS\n\ncation No. 0524790.3, filed Dec. 5, 2005, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThis invention relates to electrical devices, and in particu- lar to electrical devices designed to facilitate their charging by means of a planar inductive charging platform.\n\nHowever, for electrical devices of other shapes (especially devices with curved surfaces) finding a suitable location secondary coil may be less straightforward.\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
