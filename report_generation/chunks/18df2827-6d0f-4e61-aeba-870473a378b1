The electrolyte 106 is sandwiched between the electrodes 102, 104.\n\n[0152] The battery 100' may include an encapsulation 130 enclosing the sandwiched structure (i.e. anode 102, electro- lyte 106, and cathode 104). In this example, the encapsula- tion 130 may include the same composition that constitutes the electrolyte 106. That is, the encapsulation 130 may have the same polymeric material(s) and electrolytic solution as the electrolyte 106. Under this arrangement, the electrodes 102, 104 are equivalent to be enclosed/wrapped by the electrolyte 106.", "type": "Document"}}
