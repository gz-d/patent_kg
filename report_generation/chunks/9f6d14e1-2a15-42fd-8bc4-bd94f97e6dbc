This will include stand-alone computers, network computers, dedicated or non-dedicated hardware devices. Where the terms \u201ccomputing system\u201d and \u201ccom- puting device\u201d are used, these terms are intended to include any appropriate arrangement of computer or information processing hardware capable of implementing the function described.\n\nIt will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the invention should therefore be considered in all respects as illustrative, not restrictive.\n\nIn this embodiment, the high and low potential terminals of the power supply 104 are connected across the filament 102. The low potential terminal of the power supply 104 and the low potential terminal of the power supply 108 are directly connected with each other such that any circuit nodes directly between them (including one side of the control circuit 200) are at the same potential. The high potential terminal of the power supply 108 is connected to ground.", "type": "Document"}}
