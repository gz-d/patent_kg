Furthermore, as men- tioned above, use of a look up table enables the quantization to be carried out by a simple comparison operation. This is computationally efficient as addition, subtraction, division or multiplication operations may be avoided or at least mini- mized. Some of the benefit is obtained by carrying out the SSD in the residual transform domain (which avoids the inverse transform and reconstruction operations), however it is thought the most significant reduction in processing time comes from use of the look up table to carry out the quanti- zation and inverse quantization operations (the quantization operation is a pre-scaled quantization operation if the trans- form is\n\nStep 2: Compute the residual (difference) block: D=S-P Step 3: ICT transform the residual block: F*=ICT (D)=CDCA\n\nStep 4: Set SSD=0 and for i=0 to N-1 and j=0 to N-1 determine the quantized coefficients z,, and the SSD by the following iterative table-lookup quantization process:\n\nStep I: Set k=0 and if f,*<0 then set sign=-1, otherwise\n\nStep IT: If If,*|=(k+0.5)A,,, then k=k+1 and goto Step II; Step III: Set 2,\u2014signk and \u6240 \u4e00 Sign k-A,;\n\nStep IV: SSD= \u201cssD+q,; PE \u5168 ys Ifnot the last f* coef- ficient, goto Step I.\n\nStep 5: Entropy code of the Z to find the number of bits encode the block: R=VLC(Z)", "type": "Document"}}
