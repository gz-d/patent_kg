The test beam 200 was made by casting a 200 mm deep polysty- rene block (not shown) into the top of the plastic hinge zone 20. This polystyrene block was removed when sufficient strength developed in the concrete 15 to provide a void 80 that would be used to install a suitable compression yielding device for testing. In this way, all the compression yielding specimens could be cast in the same way regardless of the details of the compression yielding device.\n\nwere points bending. The test set-up is shown in FIG. 5. Test instrumentation included the load cell that measured the total applied load F from the load cell and the linear variable differential trans- former LVDT 1 that measured the displacement at the bottom of the mid-span, as shown in FIG. 5. Strain gauges were mounted onto the GFRP bars 18a at the mid-span to measure the tensile strain of the bars. For compression yielding beams 200, the second transducer LVDT 2 was used to measure the displacement or the shortening of mechanism 50. Strain gauges were also mounted onto the web 53 of the steel mecha-\n\nThe material properties of concrete, steel and GFRP forcing bars, and steel plate are provided in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nMaterial properties Young\u2019s Strength Modulus Material (MPa) (\u00ab103 MPa) Concrete RI \u4e00 S1 82 T16 steel bar \u4e00 T20 steel bar \u4e00 Mild steel bar \u4e00 GFRP bar 40.8 Mild steel plate 200.3 20 25 30\n\nTesting was conducted under a displacement control mode. Ina test, the hydraulic jack at the top of the test-rig applied a isplacement increment to the specimen. Responses includ- ing load, displacements and strains were recorded automati- cally. The specimen was then visually inspected and cracks were marked. When all the information was obtained for a displacement step, a new displacement increment was applied, and so on.\n\nNote:", "type": "Document"}}
