More importantly, the proposed induction system, based on a winding array structure, can generate a near-uniform magnetic field over the needed areas on the inductive surface and thus provide a near-uniform heating effect in the secondary element. Based on a multiple primary transformer winding concepts, the invention also operates on a new localized energized zone principle so that energy is coupled to the secondary element primarily through the overlapped area\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n10\n\nof the inductive and the secondary element. That is to say, energy is only transferred when a secondary winding or element is placed over one or more of the primary windings, and energy is only transferred from those primary windings that couple to the secondary winding or element, mainly the primary winding or windings directly beneath the secondary winding or element, and possibly also (though to a lesser extent) any ncarby primary windings that are close enough to couple to the secondary winding or element to a significant extent,\n\nIn the embodiments described above a single layer of transformer arrays is provided. However, in order to generate a more uniform magnetic field distribution, multi-layer transformer arrays can be used. The following embodiments describe how multiple layers of transformer arrays may be used that can provide a very uniform magnetic field distribution on the energy transfer surface,", "type": "Document"}}
