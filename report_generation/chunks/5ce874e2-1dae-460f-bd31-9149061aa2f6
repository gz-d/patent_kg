The proposal is particu- . : \u00b0 en . larly suitable, but not restricted to, off-line applications in which the lighting system is powered by the ac mains. By eliminating electrolytic capacitors which have a limited life- time of typically 15000 hours, the proposed system can be developed with passive and robust electrical components such as inductor and diode circuits, and it features long life- time, low maintenance cost, robustness against extreme tem- perature variations and good power factor. No extra electronic control board is needed for the proposed passive circuits, which can become dimmable systems if the ac input voltage\n\n(51) Int.
