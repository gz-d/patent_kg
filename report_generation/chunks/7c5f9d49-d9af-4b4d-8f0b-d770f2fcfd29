In an embodiment with solvent formation, the polymer(s) can be dissolved in a solvent. The solvent can be, \u2018or example, an organic solvent, such as a solvent wherein aratio of weight of PCL/volume of dichloromethane (DCM) is about 1 g/ml, a solvent wherein a ratio of weight of CL/volume of chloroform is about 1 g/ml, or a combination thereof. Note that, even though 1 g/ml DCM and 1 g/ml chloroform have been listed by way of example, embodi- ments of the subject invention are not limited thereto. Any reasonable concentration of organic solvent can be used. For example, an organic solvent wherein a ratio of weight of polymer/volume of solvent can be from about 0.05 g/ml to about 2.0 g/ml, or even greater, being limited only by the solubility of a chosen polymer in a chosen solvent as would of skill in the\n\nTABLE 1\n\nImplantation conditions for PII for selected implantation sources Sources Parameters Nitrogen (N,) Water (HO) Strontium (Sr) Base Pressure 7.0 x 10\u00b0 Torr 7.0 x 10\u00b06 Torr 7.0 x 10\u00b0\u00a2 Torr Working Voltage 40 kV 40 kV 15 kV Pulse Width 30 ps 30 \u5340 30 ps Implantation Time 4 hrs 4 hrs 3 hrs Frequency 200 Hz 200 Hz 200 Hz Working Pressure 5.0 x 107\" Torr 6.0 x 10~* Torr 6.4 x 10~ Torr\n\nIn an embodiment, the biodegradable metallic material(s) can be thermally treated. Depending on the material(s), the thermal treatment can help establish an oxide layer on the metallic surface. Varying the proportions of thermally treated metallic material(s) to be mixed with the polymer solution can result in hybrid materials of varying concen- trations. The metallic materials are preferable nano-sized or micro-sized units, such as beads, cones, rods, etc. The solution mixture can then be sonicated so that the metallic\n\nExample 2: Plasma Immersion Jon Implantation and Deposition (PIII & D)", "type": "Document"}}
