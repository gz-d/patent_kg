The laser 210 was tuned and provided an even light power of 130 mW to the DRA. To measure the outputs of the solar cell at different illumination angles (0), the DRA was placed ona rotator 200, as shown in FIG. 8. FIG. 9 shows the measured output voltage and current of the solar cell for the hemispherical DRA 112 as function of 8, respectively. Also shown in the figure are the outputs without the DRA. With reference to the figure, larger outputs can be obtained for 0<300 by using the DRA because of its focusing effect. With the hemispherical DR 116, the output voltage and current are increased by 13.5% and 27.2% at 0=0\u00b0, respectively. A smaller exposure radius ofR =5 mm was also used for the mask. Again, larger outputs were obtained for 6<30\u00b0 when the DR is present. In this case, the voltage and current outputs at 0=0? were increased by 11% and 21.4% with the use of the DR, respectively. The curves, however, are not included here for brevity. In practical appli- cations, the solar cell can be associated with a mechanical rotator so that it can track the light source if needed. In this case, the proposed DRA can be designed into a phased array", "type": "Document"}}
