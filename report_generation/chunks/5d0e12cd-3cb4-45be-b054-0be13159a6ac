The invention includes all such variations and modifications. The invention also includes all steps and features referred to or indicated in the specification, individually or collectively, and any and all combinations of the steps or features.\n\n[0026] FIG. 2F isa plot of JEV titer against post-treatment time, after pretreating A549 cells with berbamine, in which berbamine markedly inhibited JEV virus production.\n\n[0027] FIG. 2G includes microscopic images of A549 cells and BHK-21 cells after JEV infection with/without berbamine pretreatment.\n\n[0013] Other features and aspects of the invention become apparent by consideration of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.\n\n[0028] FIG. 3A shows the microscopic images of A549 cells after immunostaining, in which the cells were pre- treated with berbamine for 1 h, then infected with 100 MOI of JEV for 80 min before fixation and staining. The encircled. pattern refers to the presence of RNA genome of JEV.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0029] FIG. 3B shows the microscopic images of A549 cells after immunostaining, in which the cells were pre- treated with berbamine, then infected with 100 MOI of ZIKV on ice for 1 h followed by incubation in warm medium for the indicated time course before fixation and staining. The arrows point to the presence of ZIKV.\n\n[0015] FIG. 1A shows the microscopic images of HeLa cells obtained after in situ hybridization of EV-71 positive strand RNA and EV71 negative strand RNA and immunos- taining of dsRNA or LAMP, in which the HeLa cells were infected with EV-71 (MOI=1) for 7 h and EV-71 virions were observed.", "type": "Document"}}
