According to the parameter setting of the Dil- ithium, the polynomial length n is 256, and the primitive 2n-th root of unity y is 1753 in Z,. The arithmetic is performed under modulus q, which is the prime number 8380417=27\u00b0-2'\u00b0+1. The modular operation is required after the multiplication of r, and @ (i.e. Step 8). The modulus method may be adapted, and an efficient modular reduction algorithm for Z,2_,\u00bb,, may be obtained in Algorithm 5. It is worth noting that in NTT, the pre-computed twiddle factor is obtained by first calculating zeta[ \u8ba1 =Y, ij=0, 1,....n-1, and then switching the coefficient order through the bit reverse function. INTT first calculates zeta[iJ=y'\u2019, i=n, n+1, . .., 2n-1, and then performs bit reverse operation. Since y'=-1 mod q, one could deduce the pre-computed twiddle factors of INTT from NTT by flipping the sign bit. By using this method, the storage space for the twiddle factors may be\n\nreduced by half comparing with the traditional method.\n\n-continued\n\nAlgorithm 5 Modular Reduction in Z,?3 91541 13: ifr <0 then 14: x[22 : 0] =rl23: 0] + dl22 : 0] 15: end if 16: Retumr", "type": "Document"}}
