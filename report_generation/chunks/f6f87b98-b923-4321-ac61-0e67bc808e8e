FIGS. 4C-4E demonstrate the tribo-\n\nelectric output of the electronic fabric when pairing with\n\naluminum foil as the positive counterpart, the output per- formance shows the linearly proportional force-dependent relationship until 82.0 N, which can generate the maximum. output including the V,.=62 V, I,.=1.6 WA, and Q,.=49 nC at the force of 82.0 N, respectively. Water spraying treatment is also conducted for the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG to simulate the influence of water and sweating on the output performance. When spraying water on the TENG during the test, the TENG output is decreased rapidly and then, gradu- ally recovered after a certain period of self-drying, which can be restored to about 80% of the original state in 10 min (FIG. 17). FIG. 4F shows the output voltage, current and areal power density of the electronic fabric with external resistance loadings from 10 kQ to 1 GQ. The areal peak power density of the electronic fabric is calculated from the equation of P=PR/A, where A, R, I, and P represent the contact area, resistance loading, output current, and power density of the electronic fabric, respectively. The areal peak. power density of the electronic fabric can reach a peak value of 21.6 LW m7 at the external resistance loading of 40 MQ. Furthermore, the durability of the electronic fabric is dem- onstrated in FIG. 4G. The generated Vs nearly appears as a constant of ~60.5 V after 5,000 continuous cycles at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and 82.0 N loading force, showing\n\nexcellent mechanical robustness and stability.\n\nUS 2024/0260899 Al\n\nExample 6.
