Video applications commonly use a color scheme in which the planes do not correspond to specific colors. Instead one plane corresponds to luminance (the brightness of each pixel in the color image), and the other planes\u2014usually two of them\u2014contain certain color informa- tion (chrominance). When the chrominance information is combined with the luminance information, the color image can be derived and displayed, either directly or by first con- verting the information into separate RGB levels. The reason that a luminance-chrominance system is commonly used is that human perception is much more sensitive to differences in luminance than chrominance. Therefore video compres- sion algorithms typically encode the chrominance informa- tion at a lower resolution than the luminance information, in order to reduce the amount of data needed, without unduly affecting image quality. Such blocks of data with differing resolutions of luminance and chrominance data are called \u2018macroblocks\u2019. A typical macroblock may, for example, have two planes of chrominance data at half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of the luminance data. However, in this patent specification the term \u2018macroblock\u2019 is used to mean any block of image data that has chrominance data at", "type": "Document"}}
