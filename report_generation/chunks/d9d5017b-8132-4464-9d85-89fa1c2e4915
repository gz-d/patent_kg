Also, some of the embodiments of the invention can be adopted in the advanced 3D video and VR applications, such as three- dimensional TV and Free-view point TV, and six-degree of freedom (6DoF) omnidirectional (360 degree) videos. Some of the embodiments of the invention can be used to measure the quality of 3D synthesized video, which is important and useful in 3D video/image processing, coding, transmission and 3D content production. Compared with existing image/ video quality predictors/metrics, the embodiments can achieve more consistency with human vision system and can be more accurate for synthesized videos, e.g., videos in 3D or VR systems. In particular, some embodiments of the invention can predict or determine quality of synthesized videos more accurately than existing methods, especially on the view synthesis distortions induced from compressed. depth videos. Some embodiments of the invention can measure quality degradation of synthesized video caused by distortion in color and/or depth videos and the rendering\n\nV. REMARKS", "type": "Document"}}
