Generally, the spread of the size of the nanoparticles decreases as the concentration of the drug solution decreases. Furthermore, the temperature of the solution has an effect on the final particle size. Decreasing temperature of drug solution to 4 degrees Celsius before applying onto the ice template can substantially reduce the average particle size. The possible reason for this is that when a relatively warm temperature drug solution is loaded onto an ice sheet, the solution may melt the surface of its contacted ice grains slightly, which widen the pores, leading to large particle size growth inside the larger pores. All these factors are variables that may be optimised in actual production and need not be addressed herein.\n\n1.
