Thus, the chip can be thermally coupled with a thermal management device on another side (e.g., the back side) for regulating the temperature of the chip. In this example, the chip is directly attached to a heat sink for heat dissipation. In this example, a thermoelectric cooler and a fan are further used to transfer the heat more effectively from the chip to lower the operation temperature, as shown in FIG. 17.\n\n[0200] The two thermal images in FIG. 17 compare the operating temperature of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array under peak power consumption using the two heat dissipation methods (one method uses only heat sink (the lower thermal image), another method uses heat sink as well as thermoelectric cooler and fan (the upper thermal image)). The lowered operating temperature can\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nlead to higher output power and hence higher EIRP, as shown in FIG. 20. In this example, by using the thermo- electric cooler and fan, EIRP improvement of about 2 dBm can be obtained. In this example, the measured peak EIRP is 30.8 dBm at 674.9 GHz.\n\n[0201] In one measurement, the phase noise is directly measured using the spectrum analyzer. FIG. 21A shows the measured phase noise of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array at 675 GHz. FIG. 21B shows measured phase noises at 1 MHz offset at different frequencies. For comparison, the phase noise performance of the fabricated 1x2 unit cell is also measured, and the results for different frequencies are also shown in FIG. 21B. It can be seen that, compared to the 1x2 unit cell, the phase noise improvement of the 12x12 is close to the theoretical value.\n\narray\n\n[0202] The motorized rotary stage in the measurement setup in FIG. 17 is used for facilitating radiation pattern measurement.\n\n[0203]\n\nFIG. 22A shows the simulated and measured radia-", "type": "Document"}}
