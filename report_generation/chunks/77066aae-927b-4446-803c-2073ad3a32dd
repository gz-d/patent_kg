FIGS. 17(a) and 17(6) show the simple assem- bling process of these parts for a battery pack 1700. As long as the \u201cactive side\u201d of the battery pack faces the surface of the charging platform, the electronic equipment (e.g., 1800, 1802) can be charged by the planar inductive charging plat- form 1804 as shown in FIG. 18. It should be noted that the proposed device in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12 can be a separate device or can be integrated into a battery pack (FIG. 17) as explained above. When used as a separate device (FIG. 13), it can be used to make existing electronic equipment compat-", "type": "Document"}}
