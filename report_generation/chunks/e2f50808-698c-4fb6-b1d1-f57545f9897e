While extensive efforts have been made to harvest hydrodynamic energy in the format of raindrop, river/ocean wave, tide and others, achieving high output power density of electricity generation remains chal- lenging.\n\n[0015] Preferably, the method may comprise a step connecting the plurality of electricity generators in series parallel.\n\n[0016] Suitably, the glass substrate may be an ITO glass slide or a portion of an ITO glass slide.\n\n[0003] The present invention seeks to provide improved generator which makes use of energy from impacting liquid to generate electrically, or at least provide an alternative to the public.\n\n[0017] The electrode may be a conductive Al tape.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n[0018] The patent of application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be pro- vided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
