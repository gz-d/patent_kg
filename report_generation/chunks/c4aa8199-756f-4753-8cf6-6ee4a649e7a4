The success of this effort depends largely on the development of high-energy- density lithium-ion batteries (LIB s), which hold the pros- pect of replacement of internal combustion engines with rechargeable batteries. At present, layered Ni-rich transition- metal (TM) oxides, LiNi,Co,Mn,_,.,O, (x>0.6, referred as Ni-rich NCM), are widely recognized as the leading candi- dates for cathode materials for the next-generation EV-LIBs. The high capacity of Ni-rich NCM is provided by a two- electron Ni**\u2019** redox couple, so approaching the maximum content of Ni increases capacity from 160 mAhg~' for LiNi,,;Co,,;Mn,,30, (NCM111) to more than 200 mAhg\u2122* for NCM811. Also, since Ni is much less expensive than Co, maximizing the Ni content will greatly reduce the battery cost and thereby reduce the EV cost-to-mileage ratio.", "type": "Document"}}
