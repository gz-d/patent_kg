The central portion of the patch may also be symmetric about the axis of symmetry.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the defected ground structure comprises one or more slots (e.g., etched) arranged in the ground plane. The defected ground structure may comprise a central slot corresponding to the central portion of the patch. The central slot may be U-shaped. In plan view, the central slot may overlap with the central portion of the patch.\n\nthe\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n3\n\nThe defected ground structure may further comprise a first side slot arranged on a first side of the central slot and a second side slot arranged on a second, opposite side of the central slot. The first and second side slots are arranged to assist in absorbing or dissipating the energy. The first and second side slots can be symmetrically disposed about the axis of symmetry. The first and second side slots may have the same shape and size. The first and second side slots may be a generally-n shaped.\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip network further comprises one or more parasitic patches operably connected with the patch. The one or more parasitic patches may be spaced apart from the patch. The one or more parasitic patches may comprise two parasitic patches arranged at opposite sides of the patch. The two parasitic patches may be slotted patches each having one or more slots. In one example, the slot is rectangular. The two parasitic patches may be equally spaced apart from the patch and symmetrically disposed about the patch.", "type": "Document"}}
