These idiosyncratic eye movement patterns may reflect individual differences in cognitive style or abilities. For example, it was found that participants who demonstrated higher levels of curiosity made significantly more fixations in scene viewing task than those who demonstrated lower levels of curiosity. It was further found that when viewing human faces, those who scored higher on extraversion and agreeableness personality traits looked at the eyes significantly more often than those who scored lower (Wu et al., 2014).\n\nIn recent years, there have been attempts of using machine-learning methods to infer\n\ncharacteristics of the observer from eye movement data (e.g., Kanan et al., 2015). These studies typically use classifiers to discover eye movement features important for distinguishing two or more observers, and do not tell us about overall eye movement patterns associated with a particular observer. To better understand the association between eye movement patterns in visual tasks and individual differences in cognitive style or abilities, the inventors have recently developed a state-of-the-art eye movement data analysis method, Eye Movement analysis with Hidden Markov Model (EMHMM), which takes individual differences in temporal and spatial dimensions of eye movements into account (Chuk, Chan, & Hsiao, 2014.
