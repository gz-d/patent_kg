An area defining module 1000 defines an area in the video or image data which is to be encoded. A block defining module 1010 defines one or more blocks in said area in accordance with a first encoding mode. A rate distortion calculating mod- ule 1020 computes the rate distortion for each of the blocks encoded according to said first mode. The rate distortion calculating module 1020 may have a structure such as that shown in FIG. 12. The rate distortion module 1020 sums the rate distortion of the one or more blocks to find the total rate distortion for the area when it is encoded according to the first mode. The block defining and rate distortion modules 1010 and 1020 then carry out the same process but for a second encoding mode. The rate distortion of the area when encoded by the second encoding mode is thus found. The process may be repeated for one or more further encoding modes. A com- parison module 1030 compares the rate distortion cost for each of the encoding modes (as computed by the module 1020) and selects one of the encoding modes to be used for encoding the data. For example the encoding mode with the lowest rate distortion cost may be chosen. Output module 1040 then outputs the encoded data which represents the area as encoded by the selected encoding mode. The output mod- ule 1040 may carry out the encoding itself, or alternatively read from a memory encoded data which was stored earlier in the process (for example the output of entropy encoding module 950 of FIG. 12).", "type": "Document"}}
