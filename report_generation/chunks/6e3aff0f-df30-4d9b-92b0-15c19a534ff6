Some devices also address the issues of obstacle detection using the vibrotactile feedback. However, audio-based notification might be futile in an outdoor environment where the users rely on external audio cues especially in the case of visually impaired people. Studies have also shown that the vibro- haptic feedback could also underperform while a person is walking or moving.\n\n[0007] Thus, there is a need in the art for improved wearable devices that provide haptic information in region of the ear. Such devices could be used for visually- impaired or hearing-impaired users to notify them of various situations or guide them via GPS-based programs.\n\nthe\n\n[0008] Thermal Feedback in HCI\n\nthermal\n\nAs\n\n[0009] one early study on feedback, Jones Berris suggested a list of design recommendations for the thermal display based on psychological evidence. Some comprehensive research on thermal feedback in HCI has provided important insights such as: 1) hand 1s a body part with high thermal sensitivity; 2) the perception of thermal feedback could be strongly affected by clothes and the environment; 3) a set of thermal icons with an overall recognition accuracy of 83% may he designed using the rate and the direction of temperature change. More recently, researchers started investigating the spatial thermal feed- back in wearable accessories and wide variety of applica- tions, such as fingering, bracelet, headband, earhook, cane grip, etc. ThermOn was designed for users to feel dynamic hot and cold sensations on their body corresponding to the sound of music.\n\nand\n\n[0010] Multimodal Haptic Feedback on Wearable Devices", "type": "Document"}}
