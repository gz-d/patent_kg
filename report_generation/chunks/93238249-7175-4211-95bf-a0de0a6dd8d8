The hybrid materials of the subject invention can achieve controllable degradation, controllable bulk mechanical properties similar to human bone, and superior biocompatibility to cells.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 shows a schematic representation of a unit of hybrid material according to an embodiment of the subject invention.\n\nThe hybrid materials of the subject invention can impart many advantageous benefits, including for patients under- going orthopedic procedures. The subject invention can help eliminate the risks of having a metallic implant left inside body, as well as the need for additional surgery for ant removal.\n\nFIG. 2 shows a thermal-mechanical mixing machine that can be used in a fabrication method according to an embodi- ment of the subject invention.\n\nFIG. 3 shows compressive modulus as a function of amount of magnesium in a hybrid material according to an embodiment of the subject invention.\n\nThe biodegradable hybrid materials of the subject inven- tion have many applications, including but not limited to, orthopedic implants for bone fracture fixation. For example, the hybrid materials can be used as different orthopedic implants including bone screws and bone plates. The hybrid materials can also be used in cardiovascular, dental, and/or renal procedures; and in innumerable non-medical applica- tions where a durable substitute for metal or plastic is desired.\n\nFIG. 4 shows compressive modulus as a function of amount of magnesium in a hybrid material according to an embodiment of the subject invention.\n\nFIGS. 5 and 6 show fluorescent photos using enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein Osteoblasts (eGFPOB) culture.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
