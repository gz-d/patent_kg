In some embodiments, N is a positive integer and is set to be 190.\n\nIn the step $230: each of the gesture sample X is denoised, by a filter (not shown in the figures), such that a nail portion and a tail portion of the N measurement frames of the corresponding gesture sample X are removed. In some embodiments, the number of the removed frames is, for example without limitation, 19 measurement frames. Thus, the noisy measurement occurred while activating and ter- minating the recording program can be avoided.\n\nIn the step $240: a Fourier re-sampling operation is performed, by the processor P, on each of the denoised gesture samples X, such that the sample length on every channel to be N. N is, for example, 190. Then, a low-pass filter with cut-off frequency of 80 Hz is applied to filter each of the gesture samples X again after the Fourier re-sampling operation, such that the potential high-frequency random noise signal generated by the circuit is filtered. The value of 80 Hz for the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter is determined as it achieved the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as shown in the FIG. 9.\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30", "type": "Document"}}
