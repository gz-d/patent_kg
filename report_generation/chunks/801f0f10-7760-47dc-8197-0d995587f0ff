With reference to FIG. 9, the normalized power loss is lower than 0.12 in the 1-dB gain passband (5.63-5.97 GHz) and higher than 0.85 in the stopbands (5.00-5.44 GHz and 6.12-6.50 GHz) with sharp band-edge selectivity. It should be noted that the frequency response of the normalized power loss in FIG. 9 is almost complementary to that of the simulated efficiency in FIG. 8. This suggests that the band-stop filter and the filtering patch antenna have generally-complementary trans- fer functions, which are required to reduce or eliminate reflection.", "type": "Document"}}
