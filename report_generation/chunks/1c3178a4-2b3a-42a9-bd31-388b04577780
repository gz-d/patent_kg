As further described above regarding FIGS. 7-8 and 18, solar energy collection systems 1800 can comprise an array of circuitry 1810 that can be configured or adapted to electrically couple the one or more solar cell(s) 1804 (e.g., one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.) to the communications antenna 1808 and/or for operation of the one or more communications antenna(s) 1808 (or components or subcomponents thereof).\n\nAs an example, circuitry 1810 can include any of (and any number or combination of) electrical transmission lines, elec- trical storage components, voltage regulators, signal condi- tioners, Wilkinson power dividers 1400, switches, relays, and. other electrical components suitable for converting, storing, and transporting the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) 1804. Accordingly, the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) in methodologies 2000 can be used to operate any suitable portion of the com- munications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.) and/or associated or related systems.", "type": "Document"}}
