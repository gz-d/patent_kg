Similar to previous studies, the analysis with a multi-factorial repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant effect of the type of pattern or the direction of temperature change on the response time, with the average value of 2.3 seconds (SD=0.72).\n\n[0126] FIG. 16 illustrates the descriptive results of time in Study 4.\n\nresponse\n\nthe\n\n[0127] Discussion of Study 4\n\nThe\n\nspatial\n\nfourteen\n\nof\n\nthermal\n\n[0128]\n\nset\n\npatterns\n\nachieved an average accuracy of 85.3% in overall. The lowest accuracy was found for the pattern 4h8h, 63.8%, and its cold counterpart, 4c8c, also yielded a relatively low accuracy of 75.0%. Both of these patterns involve the area below the ear, which may have thicker skin and less hair than the other around-ear areas, leading to a lower thermal sensitivity as shown in Study 2 & 3. Different from these previous studies in which the area behind the ear yielded a high accuracy, the patterns with two stimuli behind the ear, 3h7h and 3c7c, resulted in relatively lower accuracy (3h7h: 77.8%, and 3c7c: 72.2%). Although both accuracies are above 70%, there is a large drop from their accuracy in Study 3. It may be because there were more confusion options against these two patterns in Study 4, whereas in Study 3 3h7h and 3c7c were the only patterns with the area behind the ear. Excluding the four aforementioned patterns with lower accuracy, the remaining 10 patterns achieved an\n\naverage accuracy of 90.6%.\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n[0129] ThermEarhook may be used along with a VR headset for an immersive gaming experience, such as feeling heat from a bomb blast or the cold feeling of the water splashing during a VR game.
