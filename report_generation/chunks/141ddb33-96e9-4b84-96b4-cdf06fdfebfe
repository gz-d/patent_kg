The system of claim 2, wherein the input power signal is a multi-phase power signal, which has at least three phases, wherein the subset of power switches is further configured to comprise a first high-side power switch, a second high-side power switch, a third high-side power switch, a first low-side power switch, a second low-side power switch, and a third low-side power switch that are arranged and associated with each other to form and function as the diode bridge to facili- tate the rectification of the multi-phase power signal to gen- erate the rectified power signal.\n\nWhat has been described above includes examples of aspects of the disclosed subject matter. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of com- ponents or methodologies for purposes of describing the dis- closed subject matter, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the disclosed subject matter are possible. Accordingly, the disclosed subject matter is intended to embrace all such alter- ations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms \u201cincludes,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d or \u201chaving,\u201d or variations thereof, are used in either the detailed description or the claims, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as \u201ccomprising\u201d is inter- preted when employed as a transitional word in a claim.", "type": "Document"}}
