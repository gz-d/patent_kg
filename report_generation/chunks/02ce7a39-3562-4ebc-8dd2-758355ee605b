[0007] Based on two planar windings 300,302 on two parallel planes as shown in Fig.3, it has been shown that both energy and signal can be transferred from one pla- nar winding to another. This planar PCB transformer technology has been applied in a range of applications. In 2004, it was used for a contactless battery charger for mobile phones (Choi B., Nho J., Cha H. and Choi S.:, \u2019Design and implementation of low-profile contactless battery charger using planar printed circuit board wind- ings as energy transfer device\u2019, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 51, No.1, Feb. 2004, pp.", "type": "Document"}}
