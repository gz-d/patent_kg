Curve 1210a is shown to have a local minimum point 12124 in the workspace of 160 mm. Curve 12106 is shown to have a local minimum point 12126 in the work- space of 100 mm. By adjusting the local minimum point, the gradient performance can be enhanced, thereby improving driving force of actuation subject under the magnetic field in the workspace. For example, the local minimum point may be controlled by energizing the coils differently. By way of example, position of local minimum point may be modified or adjusted by adjusting the direction and magnitude of excitation current in one or more coils. Different current (direction and/or magnitude) in the coils may create mag- netic field with different direction and/or magnitude. The local minimum point takes place where the magnetic field substantially cancels each other to create a local 0 mT point (i.e., local zero-field point), The change of magnetic flux density near the local minimum point within a specified distance interval (such as 0.02 mm) (i.e., the change rate) is larger than that further away from the local minimum point. Therefore, the magnetic field gradient is larger near the local minimum point. Further, as stated above, the geometric parameters of magnetic core can be optimized to improve or optimize the overall performance of the magnetic flux\n\ndensity and gradient generation.\n\n[0104] As shown, the magnetic flux density and magnetic field gradient under this mode is around 64.2 mT at point 5 and 6.7 T/m at point 3 respectively for the workspace with a size of 160 mm. The magnetic flux density and magnetic field gradient under this mode is around 137 mT at point 5 and 14.8 T/m at point 3 respectively for the workspace with a size of 100 mm. The data are shown in Table 3.\n\nlocal", "type": "Document"}}
