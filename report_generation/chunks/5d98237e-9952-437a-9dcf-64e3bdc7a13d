It offers the potential to replace the conventional laborious flo- rescence labeling approach for biosensing. In addition, SPR biosensors provide real-time quantitative analysis of bio-mo- lecular interactions through monitoring the optical response in terms of (1) angular reflectivity, (2) spectral characteristics or (3) corresponding phase shift.", "type": "Document"}}
