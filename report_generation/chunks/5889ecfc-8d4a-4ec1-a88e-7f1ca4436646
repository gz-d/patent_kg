The RNA virus may be a flavivirus, an enterovirus or a lentivirus. In embodiments herein, the method is suitable for preventing or treating a subject suffering from a flavivirus infection by administering an effective amount of berbamine or its analogue to the subject.\n\n[0038] FIG. 7A shows the high-content images of A549 cells after immunostaining, in which the cells were pre- treated with 5 1M of berbamine, 15 HM of berbamine, 30 1M of berbamine, 10 uM of fangchinoline, 20 uM of fangchi- noline, 30 uM of fangchinoline, 10 uM of isotetrandrine, 20 uM of isotetrandrine or 40 uM of isotetrandrine for 1 h, then infected with about 10 MOI of DENV-2 for 18 h. High- content images of A549 cells of a control group pretreated with DMSO are also illustrated.\n\n[0051] In an embodiment, the flavivirus is Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus or Dengue virus. In an alter- native embodiment, the flavivirus may be selected from the group consisting of West Nile virus, Murray Valley encepha- litis virus, and Yellow Fever virus.\n\n[0039] FIG. 7B is a plot showing the relative infectivity of DENV-2 in A549 cells, in which the cells were pretreated with indicated doses of berbamine, fangchinoline, or isotet- randrine for 1 h, then infected with about 10 MOI of DENV-2.\n\n[0052] Berbamine and its analogue can be classified as bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids including two benzyliso- quinoline moieties linked through diphenyl ether, benzyl phenyl ether or biphenyl bonds. Berbamine and its analogue may be artificially synthesized or may be a naturally occur- ting compound derived from a plant material, a fungus or the like.\n\n[0040] FIG. 8A is a plot showing the relative infectivity in A549 cells pretreated with 13 additionally identified compounds.", "type": "Document"}}
