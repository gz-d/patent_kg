The effect of the airgap g between the DRA and substrate is studied first without considering the solar cell, ic. with no solar cell present. FIG. 3 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the hemispherical DRA 112 of FIGS. 2a and 26 for g=0 and 2 mm, and reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated results is observed for each case. With reference to FIG. 3, it can be seen that the airgap causes the measured resonant frequency and impedance bandwidth (IS, ,|s-10 dB) to increase from 1.92 GHz to 2.26 GHz and from 14% to 19%, respectively. The antenna gains of the two prototype DRAs (g=0 and g=2 mm) of FIGS. 1 and 2, respec- tively, were measured and found to be in the range of 4-6.8 dBi across their passbands. It was observed that a DRA with an airgap has a wider gain bandwidth, which is to be expected. It is found that the antenna gain is ~5 dBi around the reso- nance for each case, which is typical for a DRA. The simu- lated and measured radiation patterns for g=0 for the hemi- spherical DRA 112 are shown in FIG. 4. As can be observed from the figure, the co-polarized fields of both the E- and H-planes are stronger than the cross-polarized fields by more than 20 dB in the boresight direction (6=0?). The radiation pattern for g=2 mm was also simulated and measured and", "type": "Document"}}
