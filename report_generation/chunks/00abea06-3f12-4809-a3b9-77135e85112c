If the heart beat is irregular, the standard deviation of heart beat time interval will be increased. The cardiac rhythmicity index is calculated as the ratio of power value of basic frequency value to the total power value of whole spectrum. The cardiac rhythmicity index is inversely corre- lated with the standard deviation of heart beat time interval determined by direct examination of heart (FIG. 6), sug- gesting that the larger the rhythmicity index the more regular the heart beat rhythm.\n\nbeat determined by direct examination of heart is increased (FIG. 8).
