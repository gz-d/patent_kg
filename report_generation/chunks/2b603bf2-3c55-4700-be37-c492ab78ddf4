FIG. 11(@) shows a hexagonal dielectric element. The top and bottom dielectric hexagonal pyramids are antireflection structures which can reduce the multi-reflec- tion at the air-dielectric interface. The middle section is a hexagonal dielectric post whose height can be varied for each pixel to realize the required transmission phase shift. FIG. 11(6) shows the structure of a transverse-variable discrete dielectric element, whose width w can be tuned for each pixel to achieve the desired phase distributions of the two lenses.\n\n[0043] The 3D focus-steering antenna may also employ other phase-control or phase-shifting structures, such as the four-layer transmit array with double-square-loop element depicted in FIGS. 12(a)-(6).\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\nMetalens Design:\n\n[0044] Design of Metalens #1 (DDL 1)\n\n[0045] The schematic of Metalens #1 (DDL 1) and its interaction with incident radiation is depicted in FIG. 13(4). A linearly polarized standard pyramid horn (Millitech SGH- 03) with a gain of 23 dBi at 0.3 THz is adopted as the feed. The origin of the global coordinate system Og is located at the phase center of the feed horn. The distance between the phase center of the feed horn and Metalens #1 is set as f,=24 mm to provide a proper illumination taper on the aperture of the metalens. Metalens #1 is aimed at transforming the spherical phase front from the phase center of the feed source into a titled plane wave phase front above the aperture of Metalens #1 as shown in FIG. 13(6).
