Specifically, FIG. 11 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for generating an Airy beam at the m=-1 harmonic fre- quency in free space. In this example, the Airy beam requires a spatial-varying phase profile as 4/3a\",,(-x)*. FIG. 12 shows the required aperture phase profile of the Airy wave- front and the corresponding normalized time shiftings for the meta-atoms of the metasurface antenna 400 at different positions. FIG. 13 shows the measured E-field intensities in the xz-plane at different harmonic frequencies. In FIG. 13, the dashed line represents the theoretical parabolic trajectory\n\nof the Airy beam x=az? (in this example, the acceleration\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nfactor a\u20140.003). Only the target m=-1 harmonic frequency possesses high field intensity; other harmonic frequencies are all highly suppressed in free space. FIG. 14 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for light focus- ing at the m=-1 harmonic frequency. In this example, the local momentum or output angle of the extracted propagat- ing waves from all meta-atoms of the metasurface antenna 400 are different. FIG. 15 shows the required normalized local momentum k/&,, as a function of the meta-atom position for different focal spot positions from F, to Fs, where F,=(-100 mm, 80 mm), F,;=(-70 mm, 80 mm), F; (-40 mm, 80 mm), F, (-10 mm, 80 mm), and Fs (20 mm, 80 mm). FIG. 16 shows the measured E-field intensities at the m=-1 harmonic frequency along the line z=80 mm as the focal spot scans from Fi to F;. FIG. 17 shows the corre- sponding measured E-field intensities in the xz-plane at the m=-1 harmonic frequency for different focus spots Fi to F;.", "type": "Document"}}
