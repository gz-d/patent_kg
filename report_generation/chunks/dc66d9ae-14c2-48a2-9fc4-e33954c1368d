PSO is a robust and powerful optimization arithmetic to approach global minima. To implement PSO, an initial set of random positions and velocities are defined for the particles in the swarm. The particles fly through the N-dimension problem space subject to both deterministic and stochastic update rules to new positions as follows:\n\nvy =WxV te pxrand( )x(Piocat bes %n)}+Coxrand ( X(Patoreet Bese Xn)\n\nXp =X AM\n\nwhere v, and x,, are the velocity and position of the particle in the n\u201d dimension, respectively. c, and cs are the self- and group-knowledge constants, which determine the relative pull, and w is the inertial weight. For this optimization problem, the radius and reference phase are set as the positions for the particles in the swarm. Meanwhile, r\u201c=0 mm and C=0\u00b0 are chosen to ensure that the focus is at the center when o=90\u00b0 and provide a reference aperture phase distribution to other focusing cases. The swarm population was set to 20 particles and 1000 iterations. The inertial weight w was varied linearly from 0.9 to 0.4, and the self-knowledge and group-knowledge constants, c, and c,\n\nin\n\nDec. 9, 2021\n\nwere set equal to 2. The fitness function of this optimization is to minimize the total phase variance of the whole metalens aperture. The swarm of particles explores the problem hyperspace and eventually settles down to the optimum solution.\n\nFocus radial steering: To steer the focus along the\n\n[0053]", "type": "Document"}}
