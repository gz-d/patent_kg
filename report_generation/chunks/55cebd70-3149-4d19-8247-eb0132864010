For example, circuitry 1810 can include coupling circuitry to collect, condition, transport, or otherwise deliver suitable power to electrical components of solar energy collection system 1800, including, but not limited to the one or more communications antenna(s) 1808. As a further example, cir- cuitry 1810 can include any of (and any number or combina- tion of) electrical transmission lines, electrical storage com- ponents, voltage regulators, signal conditioners, Wilkinson power dividers 1400, switches, relays, and other electrical components suitable for converting, storing, and transporting the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) 1804. Accordingly, circuitry 1810 of solar energy collection system 1800 can facilitate employing at least a portion of the electrical potential generated by the one or more solar cell(s) 1804 in the operation of the one or more communications\n\nAt 1904, a portion of the solar radiation can be collected by one or more solar cell(s) (e.g., one or more solar cell(s) 302, one or more solar cell(s) 502, etc.) to create collected solar radiation. As an example, methodologies 1900 can further include collecting a portion of the first portion (or the second portion) of incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.) by the one or more solar cell(s) thereby creating a first collected solar radiation (or a second collected solar radiation).", "type": "Document"}}
