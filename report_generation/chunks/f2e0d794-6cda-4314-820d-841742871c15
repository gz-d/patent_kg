In another embodi- ment, the processor 108 may be a portable device carried the subject.\n\n[0071] In the present invention, the processor 108 deter- mines whether the EMG pattern is indicative of an abnormal motor movement. In particular, the processor 108 compares the EMG pattern with a set of pre-set data. The processor 108 may generate a gait cycle based on the EMG pattern and optionally neuronal activity detected by the neural electrode 102, and then compare the gait cycle with the pre-set gait data stored in the processor 102. The pre-set gait data is preferably derived based on healthy individuals who have the same age and sex as the subject. When the processor 108 determines there is an abnormal motor movement, e.g. an increase in the swing or stance phase, an increase in mean neuronal firing rate, an increase in number of bursts, and/or a decrease in interspike interval compared to the pre-set data, then the processor 108 outputs a stimulation signal to the stimulus generator 110 so as to deliver a pulse to deep cerebellar nuclei through the neural electrode 102. The deep cerebellar nuclei will be stimulated and the motor movement of the subject will then be modulated.\n\n[0065] In an embodiment, the neurostimulation system 100 includes one or more EMG electrodes 102, for example at least 2 or at least 4 electrodes, to be implanted in the subject\u2019s muscle particularly muscle of a limb. For example, the EMG electrodes 102 may be implanted in one or more muscles selected from the group consisting of tibialis ante- rior, gastrocnemius muscle, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, biceps brachii, vastus lateralis, and combinations thereof.", "type": "Document"}}
