In some embodiments, the antenna include a single dielectric block with a groove along its center, and is operable (when excited at the corresponding port) as one or both of the microwave dielectric resonator antenna and millimeter-wave Fabry- Perot resonator antenna. The resonant frequencies of the dielectric resonator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna can be determined independently for fabrication, making it easy to achieve a large frequency ratio (widely- separated frequency/wave bands). Also, the antenna, by artfully integrating the microwave dielectric resonator antenna with the millimeter-wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna into one antenna, can be made compact and light. In some embodiments, the antenna is particularly useful for 4G, 5G, 6G, 7G, etc., frequency bands. The antenna of the various embodiments can be used in different communica- tion systems such as RF systems, microwave systems, or wireless systems, and in different communication devices\n\n4. The antenna of claim 3, wherein the dielectric block includes opposite side-surfaces and a base surface that together define the groove, and the conductor comprises one more conductor strips arranged at least partly on opposite side-surfaces and the base surface.\n\n5. The antenna of claim 4, wherein the opposite surfaces are generally parallel.\n\n6. The antenna of claim 4, wherein the opposite surfaces are separated by a first distance, and the distance is at least a half-wavelength distance.", "type": "Document"}}
