This SAD-based cost function could save a lot of computations as the distortion part is based on the differences between the original block and the predicted block instead of the recon- structed block. However, this computation reduction usually comes with a quite significant degradation of coding effi- ciency. To achieve better rate-distortion performance, JM6.1d also provided an alternative SATD-based cost function:\n\nOne known theoretical method of choosing the best block encoding mode is to compute the rate-distortion cost of all the possible modes. The rate-distortion cost is aparameter, which takes account of both the distortion caused by the encoding and the number of bits required to encode the block.\n\nIt is possible to encode and decode each block to find the distortion and bit rate for each mode directly. For example, in the H.264/AVC encoding process, the best macroblock encoding mode may be selected by computing the rate-dis- tortion cost of all possible modes. The best mode is typically the one with minimum rate-distortion cost. The rate distortion cost for a given mode may be defined as:\n\nSATD(S, P)+21-4K if intra 4x4 mode SATD\\S, P) (EQUATION 5) Isarp = otherwise\n\nwhere SATD(S,P) is the sum of absolute Hadamard-trans- formed difference between the original block S and the dicted block P, which is given by:\n\nJap=SSDS.CMR (BQUATION 1)\n\nwhere Jp represents the rate distortion, A is the Lagrange multiplier, R is the number of bits required to encode the block according to that mode, and the SSD(S,C) is the sum of the squared differences (SSD) between the original blocks S and the reconstructed block C when that encoding mode is used. The sum of squared differences can be expressed as:\n\nN-IN-1 SATD(S, P) = > 70 70 (EQUATION 6) Vl", "type": "Document"}}
