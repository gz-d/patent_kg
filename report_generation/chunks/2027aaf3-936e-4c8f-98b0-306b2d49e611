As can be seen from\n\ntive coils, or may be formed as conductive tracks on one or\n\nmore printed circuit boards.\n\nFIG. 8B, this embodiment of the present invention includes a\n\nUS 8,040,103 B2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nfirst and second windings may be connected series or in parallel, and may be driven in the same the same polarity or may be driven independently.\n\nof the secondary module must be placed directly on top of the planar winding of the primary unit. [fit is slightly misplaced, the energy transfer will be seriously hampered; (2) The use of one spiral planar winding in the secondary module to pick up energy emitted from the primary winding requires the choice of switching frequency to be very high. In Choi et al, the operating frequency has to be 950 kHz. Such high switching frequency leads to high switching loss in the primary inverter circuit, high AC resistance in the PCB copper tracks and more importantly high electromagnetic interference (EMI) emis- sion.\n\nThe first winding may preferably extend about the periph- ery of the charging surface and the second winding may be located at the center of the charging surface. Preferably the second winding is a spiral winding. The first winding and the second winding may be generally rectangular or circular.\n\nIn cases where a single second winding is insufficient compensate for voltage sag, a third winding is provided located within said area defined by said first winding.\n\nProblem (1) can be solved by using a planar inductive charging platform based on a multi-layer planar winding array structure, which allows the charged electronic equip- ment to be placed anywhere on the charging surface as described in GB2389720A. However requiring a multi-layer charging platform increases the complexity of the charging platform undesirably.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:", "type": "Document"}}
