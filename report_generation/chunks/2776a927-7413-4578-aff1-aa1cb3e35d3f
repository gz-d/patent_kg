Cells are seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2,500 cells per well (for A549, and A2780) or 5,000 cells per well (for A549cisR, A2780cisR, and MRC-S5) and incubated for 24 h. Cells are then treated with medium containing various concentrations of complexes for 6 h. The medium is replaced by phenol-red free medium. Then cells are irradi- ated with near-infrared radiation (880 nm, 0.4 W/cm?) for 80 min. After irradiation, cells are further incubated in fresh medium for 18 h at 37\u00b0 C. Then, the culture medium is removed, cells are then incubated with FBS free medium containing 1 mg/mL MTT for 2 h. Medium containing MTT is removed and 150 pL DMSO is added to each well. The absorbance is measured at 570 and 630 nm.\n\n[0144] The cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin, ligand 3, complex 4, and complex 5 against various cancer cell lines is shown in Table 1. Cells are treated with the indicated complex for 6 h, the culture medium is replaced with fresh medium and irradiated with or without blue light for 1 h. Then cells are cultured for another 42 h.\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\nTABLE 1\n\nshowing ICaa (4M) Cell line Ligand 3 Carboplatin Complex 4 Complex 6 Oxaliplatin Complex 5 Complex 7 A2780* 145.7288 30282348 >50 >50 86.5 27.7 >50 >50 A2780* 578244 3359248 107222 UW4215 737259 15.6225 54209 A2780cisR* 122.8 \u00a3 9.2 667.5 + 51.1 >50 >50 249.6 # 12.6 = >50 >50 A2780cisR** 48.5 27.7 6297+ \u4e0a 432 1.2228 127219 253.7+182 194245 3.6204 A549* 182.629.7 4178+ \u4e0a 33.6 >50 >50 97.2 27.5 >50 >50 AS49ss 594+41 4352+ \u4e0a 429 17.7251 116212 1043282 29.7238 57+14 AS49cisR* 177.3 = 9.1 >700 >50 >50 2578+116 >50 >50 AS49cisR** 72.2 3.4 >700 189243 126221 26942163 269+32 62411 MRC-5* 193.6 + 14.8 689.62385 >50 >50 2134+164 \u00a9 >50 >50\n\n*indicates the test is conducted in the dark with no irradiation.", "type": "Document"}}
