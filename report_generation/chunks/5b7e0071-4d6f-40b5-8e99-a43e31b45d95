Optional step 310 comprises encapsulating device 100, 200 with an encapsu- lating material.\n\nwearable power source due to its smaller footprint than the device 200. The wearable power source can continuously generate power (i.e. electrical power) from body heat or any other low grade heat source. The device 100 can be formed small enough to be used as a portable and wearable power source. The device comprises a flexible substrate which allows the device 100 to be manipulated and bent and flexed into desired configurations when worn. The device 100 is advantageous because it continuously generates electrical power as long as it is exposed to heat. Unlike a battery, there is no finite capacity due to chemicals. The device 100 will there is heat.", "type": "Document"}}
