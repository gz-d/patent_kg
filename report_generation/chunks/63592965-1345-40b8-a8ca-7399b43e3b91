Inan exemplary embodiment, spinal deformities can be completely corrected at the time of operation. In another exemplary embodiment, spinal deformities can be gradually corrected both during and after the operation. For example, a constant or substantially constant correction force can be applied to a deformed spine portion subsequent to the surgery, allowing a gradual correc- tion of the spinal deformities without inducing neurological problems or compromise of the implant-bone interface.\n\nFIG. 2 shows a second embodiment of the correction device, in which a transverse traction member is provided single rod system.\n\nFIG. 3 shows a third embodiment of the correction device, which a cross-linking element is provided to a dual rod. system.\n\nFIG. 4 shows a fourth embodiment of the correction device, in which a transverse traction element or a cross- linking element is provided to a dual rod system.", "type": "Document"}}
