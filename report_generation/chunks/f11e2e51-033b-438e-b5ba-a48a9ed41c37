It can be appreciated that such systems and components can include those components or specified sub-components, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components, and according to various permutations andcom- binations of the foregoing. Sub-components can also be implemented as components coupled to other components rather than included within parent components (hierarchical).\n\nFIG. 29 depicts exemplary output voltages 2902 of the one or more solar cell panels 502 for a further non-limiting imple- mentation of a GA 500 as described herein as a function of 0 2904. As an example, as described above regarding FIGS. 5-6, a new height of H=47 cm to obtain output voltages 2902 of the one or more solar cell panels 502 using the U-shaped\n\nFIG. 27 illustrates a top view of an exemplary non-limiting\n\nat 0=0\u00b0.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nbe the\n\na\n\nin various\n\nembodiments of the dis-\n\nfrom the subject matter described herein.\n\nAdditionally, it should be noted that one or more compo- nents may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality or divided into several separate sub- components in order to provide integrated functionality.
