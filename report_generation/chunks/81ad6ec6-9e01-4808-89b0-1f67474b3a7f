With regard to 3-D con- tent, for a particular visual image 104 of enhanced 2-D con- tent, there can be 2 or more 2-D views (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more views) that together make up the 3-D image scene. The multiple 2-D images of the 3-D image scene can be rendered into a single 2-D image (e.g., single enhanced 2-D image).\n\nThe projector component 106 can provide (e.g., project or present) visual images 104 to the projector screen component 102 for presentation by the projector screen component 102. The visual images 104 provided by the projector component 106 can contain the signal(s), for example, embedded in a signal region 114 of the visual images 104. For instance, a visual image 104 can include or have embedded therein a signal in a signal region 114 of the visual image 104 that can correspond in location to the control region 112 of the pro- jector screen component 102. When the projector component 106 provides the visual images 104 to the projector screen component 102, the signal(s) of the visual images 104 can be contained or presented (e.g., projected or displayed) in the control region 112 of the projector screen component 102.", "type": "Document"}}
