The ground plane 206 is generally a flat conductive surface with three slots. At the center of the ground plane 206, which, in plan view, correspond to the main patch 204A is a U-shaped slot, ai,/2 U-shaped slot 230 formed (e.g., etched) in the ground plane 206. Two generally-y shaped side slots 232 are arranged on two sides of the U-shaped slot 230 to improve the suppression level of the lower stopband.\n\n[0049] FIG. 2C shows the filter element 214 at least partly arranged inside the substrate 202. In this embodiment, the filter element 214 is a chip resistor embedded in the substrate 202 (a small hole formed in the substrate 202) for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy. The chip resistor has a resistance of 477. One end of the chip filter is soldered to the main patch 204A whereas the other end of the chip filter is soldered to the ground plane 206.\n\n[0052] FIGS. 4A and 4B show the prototype 400 of filter-antenna fabricated based on the filter-antenna 200 FIGS. 2A to 2D. Dimensions of the prototype 400 are listed. the following table.\n\nTABLE I\n\n\u5de5 15.9 mm Ss 2.55 mm T3 0.75 mm L; 8.1 mm Ws 0.5 mm Lys 8.9 mm DIMENSIONS OF THE FILTER-ANTENNA PROTOTYPE Ww, L, Wr Wo 8 S> 94mm 72mm 24mm 14mm 13mm 12.95 mm Sy Ss Se Sy 1 \u5403 075mm 165mm 12mm 09mm 048mm 18mm Ly Lo Ls Ly Ls Le 07mm 215mm 995mm 98mm 27mm 116mm Ls Ly WwW, We Ws Wy 2mm 2.65 mm 015mm 4mm limm 04mm We Ww; Le La Lys Lys 04mm 0.8mm 104mm 3mm 125mm 21mm Wat Wo H G t Ens 0.2mm 0.15 mm 30mm 40 mm 1.575 mm 2.33\n\n[0050] The filter-antenna 200 of FIGS. 2A to 2D includes a filter integrated into the patch antenna.
