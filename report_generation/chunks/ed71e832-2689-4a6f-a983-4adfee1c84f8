The results of CARPID are tested by western blotting, using TAF15 and SNF2L antibodies. The streptavidin affin- ity-coupled magnetic beads are added to lysate of the HEK293T cell transfected with BASU-dCasRx, as well as pre-gRNA (control), locus 1 (XIST-L1), locus 2 (XIST-L2) or locus 3 (XIST-L3), to precipitate the biotinylated protein. The experiment is carried out in three biological replicates and representative results are shown. The WB signal is quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.8.0_172).\n\nto\n\nin\n\nof\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\n[0074] FIGS. 8a to 8d show TAF15 HTR-SELEX, wherein:\n\n[0075] FIG. 8a shows the design scheme for the oligo- nucleotide of HTR-SELEX. These oligonucleotides contain promoter, lumina adaptor (P5/P7) and 40-nt random sequence.\n\nT7\n\n[0076] FIG. 84 is a schematic diagram of the HTR- SELEX experiment. First, the synthesized DNA template library is transcribed into RNA, and TAF15 protein is expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta P3 DE LysS strain. After bound, washed and eluted, the remaining (bound) RNA is subjected to reverse transcription and PCR ampli- fication to obtain an NGS sequencing library. The DNA library is sequenced by the Illumina Hiseq 4000 for molecu- lar counting, and part of the library is used as input for the next round of HTR-SELEX (see methods for details).\n\n[0077] FIG. 8c shows the RNA binding motif of TAF15 enriched from the HTR-SELEX analysis.\n\nFIG. 8d shows the machine learning scheme.
