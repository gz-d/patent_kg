The mixture was frozen to 78 K ina liquid nitrogen bath and evacuated for 10 min, followed by warming to room temperature after sealing. After another two freeze-pump-thaw cycles, the mixture was heated to 120\u00b0 C. and reacted for 72 h. The crude produce was filtered and washed with water, dimethylformamide, tetrahydro- furan, and dichloromethane to yield a brown solid (49.4 mg, 79.5%).\n\nExample 2\n\nSynthesis of benzo[5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3-b]thian- threne-6,13-dione (Model Compound)\n\n[0072] Benzene-1,2-dithiol (100 mg, 0.7 mmol), 2,3,5,6- tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (72 mg, 0.3 mmol), and potas- sium carbonate (249 mg, 1.8 mmol) were charged in a flask.
