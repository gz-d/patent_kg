While breakthroughs in bio-inspired engineering have created a wide range of structures that enable various fascinating functionalities, these achievements remain conceptual because of the daunting challenge in creating desired hier- archical structures at affordable cost, in large scale, and/or with desired material. Generally, pre-designed hierarchical structures can only be prototyped using expensive and sophisticated technologies (that is, the standard MEMS process and/or two-photon 3D printing technologies). These methods are limited by very low throughput and very high cost, and are applicable to only a few materials, e.g., Si and photoresist. As a result, the created rigid structures inevita- bly suffer from limited structural durability, flexibility, and optical transparency, not to mention the unaffordable cost, thereby preventing their broad real-life applications. Thus, it is imperative to develop an affordable and scalable strategy to facilely fabricate hierarchical structures and increase the\n\n[0005] In one embodiment of the present invention, the three-dimensional hierarchical structure comprises a closed- loop structure, a doubly reentrant structure, an arch, a high aspect ratio rod, a high aspect ratio two-cycle helix, or a 3D array.\n\none the present invention, elastomer mold has a cracking coeflicient 1 of at least 100% and a deformation coeflicient @ during the first phase, and 1/\u00ae is equal to or greater than g, and \u00a2 is the ultimate elongation at break of the elastomer mold.\n\n[0007] In one embodiment of the present invention, cracking coefficient is computed by:\n\n=F nin", "type": "Document"}}
