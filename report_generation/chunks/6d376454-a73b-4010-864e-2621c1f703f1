A total covering angle 6 of the receiving electrode layer 114, which means a maximum sensing angle range of the detector DD, is defined an angle included by two extending lines extending from two endmost opposite edges of the receiving electrode layer 114 to the center C of circle, respectively. In some embodiments, the covering angle 0 is 20 degrees(\u00b0), and the total covering angle \u00a9 is 120 degrees (*).\n\nThe transmitting electrode layer 116 may be disposed (or sandwiched) in between the intermediate and the bottom insulating layers 1126, 112c. The length of the transmitting electrode layer 116 in the circumferential direction may be longer than that of the receiving electrode layer 114.\n\nThe ground electrode layer 118 may be embedded in the bottom insulating layer 112c. In detail, the bottom insulating layer 112c includes two separated portions, and the ground electrode layer 118 is disposed (or sandwiched) therebe- tween. The ground electrode layer 118 is electrically coupled to an electrical ground. The receiving electrode layer 114, the transmitting electrode layer 116, and the ground elec- trode layer 118 are concentrically disposed with each other and share the same center C of circle.\n\nThe exemplary materials of\n\nthe receiving electrode layer\n\n114, the transmitting electrode layer 116, and the ground electrode layer 118 may be conductive and elastic materials, for example, thin-film conductive fabric or metal. In some embodiments, the aforesaid electrode layers 114, 116, 118 are produced by a laser cutter.\n\n25\n\n40\n\n45", "type": "Document"}}
