The imaging apparatus has an elec- tron gun arranged to provide electron beam to scan a specimen, and the deflector. The deflector is arranged to move the electron beam in a first scanning direction and a second scanning direction that are in the same plane for scanning the specimen. The control unit is configured to determine the first scanning direction and the second scan- ning direction, process the determined first scanning direc- tion and the determined second scanning direction based on predetermined equations, and provide, based on the process- ing, a control signal to the deflector to adjust one or both of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direc- tion such that (i) the first scanning direction and the second adjusted scanning direction are within a required orthogo- nality limit or (ii) the first adjusted scanning direction and the second adjusted scanning direction are within a required orthogonality limit. The deflector may comprise one or more deflector coils. The current running through the coils is\n\nwhere A' is a detected amplitude of a drive signal in the first scanning direction, B' is a detected amplitude of a drive signal in the second scanning direction, A is a required amplitude of a drive signal in the first reference scanning direction, B is a required amplitude of a drive signal in the second reference scanning direction, is a deviation angle between the second scanning direction and the second reference scanning direction. The control signal is arranged to control the deflector based on A and B. These predeter- mined equations can be applied when \u4e2d is smaller than 45 degrees, when is smaller than 30 degrees, when is smaller than 15 degrees, when is smaller than 10 degrees, when \u4e2d is smaller than 5 degrees.", "type": "Document"}}
