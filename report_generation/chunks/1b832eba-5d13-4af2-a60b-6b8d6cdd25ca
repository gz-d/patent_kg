However, these anten- nas have narrow bandwidth and low gain. With the emer- gence of SG and other future wireless communication tech- nologies, there is a need to provide antennas and hence communication devices that can provide improved perfor- mance.\n\n[0013] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the second conductive strip provides a phase inverter.\n\n[0014] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first conductive strip and the second conductive strip are arranged on a second side of the substrate, wherein the second side is opposite the first side.\n\n[0015] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the conductive strip and the second conductive strip are spaced. and extending substantially in parallel.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0016] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the conductive strip is arranged on a second side of the substrate and the second conductive strip is arranged on the first the substrate; wherein the second side is opposite the side.", "type": "Document"}}
