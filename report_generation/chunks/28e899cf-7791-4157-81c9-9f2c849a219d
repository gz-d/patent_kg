The key feature of the invention is the use of a light transmissible DRA in a circuit where the DR shares at least part of the footprint of another component but allows light to pass through the DR towards and/or away from said another component, particularly where said another component is a light processing or generating component. The invention generally envisages using non- planar transparent DR in circuits in the aforementioned man-\n\nIn the embodiment of an electronic system 300 as particu- larly illustrated by FIG. 13, there is provided a wireless com- munication device having a wireless signal transmit chain 320 and a wireless signal receive chain 330. The wireless signal transmit chain 320 comprises a message formatting or generating module 321 optionally followed by an encoding module 322. The encoding module 322 is followed by a modulator 323 and a signal transmitting module 324. The wireless signal transmit chain 320 is completed by a com- bined DRA and optical component module 315a. One skilled in the art will understand the functionality and purpose of each of the modules comprising the wireless signal transmit\n\nMore specifically, the invention provides an electronic device including a DRA, wherein the DRA functions as an antenna of said electronic device and wherein said DRA is positioned in said device so that the DR is located so as to intercept light travelling along a light pathway of said device. The electronic device includes in some embodiments a device for generating power from light impinging on said device,\n\nWhilst the foregoing description of preferred embodiments\n\nsuch devices.\n\nFIG. 13 illustrates an electronic system 300 having a DRA\n\n310 by the DRA acting as a light guide or pathway.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40", "type": "Document"}}
