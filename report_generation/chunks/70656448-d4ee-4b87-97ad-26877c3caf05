The capacitor current is sensed by a sensing resistor and the output of the voltage amplifier will generate a voltage V1+V,2 at the output of the apparatus through a voltage trans- former. The voltage ratio between the input of the voltage amplifier and the output of the apparatus is ideally equal to unity.\n\nFIG. 12 shows the embodiment o input. The capacitor current is sensed former and a sensing resistor and the output is a non-iso type with the voltage follower directly connected to the of the apparatus.

The measured values are as follows: C=184 WF, L_=20.27 nH, and r.\u20140.1Q. The resonant frequency is about 82 kHz. With the active cancellation technique of the inven- tion, FIG. 14 shows the impedance characteristics achieved. The measured effective values of Le and rc are 2.2 nH and. 0.09 mQ, respectively giving a significant reduction in the series equivalent inductance and resistance. The resonant fre- quency is at 250 kHz. 45 50", "type": "Document"}}
