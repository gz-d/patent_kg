The generator resembles a transistor and powered by impacting liquid such as water droplets. The generator has a glass substrate defining an upwardly facing surface and a downwardly facing surface. The substrate includes i) a region with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated on the upwardly facing surface and acting as a virtual source and ii) an electrode arranged adjacent said PTFE coated region on the upwardly facing surface and acting as a drain in that the PTFE coated region and the electrode are positioned on the upwardly facing surface to receive an impacting water droplet acting as a gate, and wherein circuitry of the gen- erator connects the virtual source and the drain via an electrical connection passing the downwardly facing sur- face, and electricity is harvested via the electrical connec-\n\n(72) Inventors: Zuankai WANG, Hong Kong (CN); Wanghuai XU, Hong Kong (CN): Huanxi ZHENG, Hong Kong (CN) >\n\n(21) Appl.
