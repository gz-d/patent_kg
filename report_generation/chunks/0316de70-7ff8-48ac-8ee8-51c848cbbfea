The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. Terms of degree, such as \u201csubstan- tially\u201d or \u201cabout\u201d are understood by those of ordinary skill to refer to reasonable ranges outside of the given value, for example, general tolerances associated with manufacturing, assembly, testing, and use of the described embodiments.\n\n[0042] In one embodiment, there is provided a covalent organic framework (COF) that includes a plurality of aro- matic moieties each linked by at least one thioether linkage. In a preferred embodiment, the COF includes a dithioether linkage. As used herein, \u201ccovalent organic framework\u201d refers to an organic crystalline porous material that inte- grates molecular building blocks (i-e., the aromatic moieties) connected by covalent linkages and integrated into a peri- odie structure, which may be extended into two or three dimensions. In one embodiment, the COF may have a porous yet rigid structure.", "type": "Document"}}
