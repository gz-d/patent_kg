The method comprises sensing an output signal at a passive com- ponent at an output of the regulator, generating a ripple com- pensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference signal comprising a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regulator and the sensed output signal, and applying said ripple compensating signal to said passive out- put component to thereby reduce a ripple signal comprising said difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal to provide a compensated output signal for the regulator, wherein a compensator circuit for generating the ripple compensating signal does not have to process a whole of an output load power of the regulator.\n\nThe regulator with compensator circuit may be provided on asame IC,\n\nAlternatively, the compensator circuit may be provided separate circuit arranged for connection to the regulator circuit. This arrangement enables a legacy device to updated by simple connection of the compensator circuit regulator of the legacy device.", "type": "Document"}}
