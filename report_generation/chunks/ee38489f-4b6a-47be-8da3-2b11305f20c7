By providing an array of windings a more uniform magnetic flux distribution can be provided, and the possibility of a localized charging zone mechanism is enabled as will be discussed further below. It will be understood that only the area of the induction surface covered by the secondary element will be activated, while most of the non-covered area radiates virtually no energy.\n\n10\n\nAs shown in Fig.4, the primary transformer circuit unit transmits electrical energy at high frequency through a flat inductive surface that contains an array of primary transformer windings. The inductive surface can be of circular, square, rectangular, hexagonal or any polygonal shape depending on the requirement of the applications. In Fig.4, a rectangular inductive surface is used as an example. The primary transformer windings can be of circular, square, rectangular, hexagonal or any polygonal shape. If utilization of space is needed, these windings can be wound into hexagonal shape. These windings can be wound in a concentric or spiral manner. For low power applications, they can be printed on a circuit board,", "type": "Document"}}
