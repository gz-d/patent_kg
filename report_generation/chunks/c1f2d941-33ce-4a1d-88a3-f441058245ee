In one embodiment, the mono- meric units repeat in a linear chain to form a network. In another embodiment, the monomeric units repeat in a branched fashion to form a network. In a particular embodi- ment, the monomeric units consist of a dimer diamine end-capped with ureidopyrimidinone (UPy). A monomeric unit may comprise one or more UPy motifs. In one example embodiment, the one or more monomeric units repeat con- tinuously in a linear chain and the UPy motifs in the monomeric unit crosslink the linear chains to form a net- work. Preferably, the monomeric unit has two UPy motifs. In an alternative embodiment, the monomeric unit com- rises at least three UPy motifs and wherein one or more monomeric units repeat to form a branched chain network.\n\n[0094] For example, the heteroatom may be selected from N, O, or S. The dotted line denotes no double bonds, one double bond, two double bonds or three double bonds in the cyclic group and the wavy line denotes a linkage between the R group and the adjacent atoms.\n\n[0095] In a preferred embodiment, R has a structure of Formula (IIb):\n\nFormula (IIb) Ry Ry a (> * Rs Ry", "type": "Document"}}
