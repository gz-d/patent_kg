In particular, the receptors 208 may be a biological molecule that is specific to a biomarker of a cancer such as an antigen of a particular cancer. In this example, the biological mol- ecule 208 may be an aptamer (i.e. an oligo-RNA/DNA or a peptide) that can specifically capture an antigen of a cancer 112. Preferably, the biological molecule 208 is an oligo- RNA containing a sequence that is specific to the antigen of\n\n[0057] The target substance 112 in the sample solution 107A may by captured by the substance selection structure 104 when they are in contact. Thus, the amount of target substance in the sample solution is reduced, rendering a reduction of conductivity of the sample solution 107A with respect to the reference solution 107B. As such, the current flow across the electrodes is reduced accordingly. By mea- suring such alteration in current over time (i.e. current flow), the amount of target substance in the sample solution may be determined.\n\nare\n\nIn\n\nof\n\nMay 6 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0131995 A1\n\n4\n\nform a gold - sulphur bond to couple with the gold nano - layer .\n\ngastric cancer .
