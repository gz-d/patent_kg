FIG. 4E illustrates the linear relation- ship between the photoacoustic Doppler results and the\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\ndual-pulse results. A linear fitting gives the R2 of 0.9384. Vein is the flow speed measured by photoacoustic Doppler method. V545/s32 is the flow speed measured by the dual- pulse method. FIG. 4F shows the spectrum of the dual-pulse flow speed in the artery as labeled with a star 420 in FIG. 4A. A heartbeat rate of 4.6 Hz is observed. FIG. 4G shows the time-domain blood flow speed in the artery which is aver- aged by 100 times. The thicker line is a lowpass filtered result cut off at 10 Hz.\n\n[0089] The in vivo experiment to obtain FIGS. 4A to 4G was carried out on anaesthetized female BALB/c mice (4 weeks). The region of interest (ROI) shown in FIG. 4A is 0.5 mmx0.5 mm. The raster scanning takes 40 seconds with a 10-Hz b-scan rate. The laser repetition rate is 4 kHz and the pulse energy for each wavelength is ~80 nJ. Using the fitted model, the blood flow speed in the ROI is calculated at each pixel from the photoacoustic signals at 545 nm and 532 nm as shown in FIG. 4B. In the artery, the averaged flow speed. is ~6 mm/s. In the vein, the averaged flow speed is ~3 mm/s.\n\n[0090]\n\nFor\n\ncomparison,\n\nboth\n\nDoppler\n\nphotoacoustic", "type": "Document"}}
