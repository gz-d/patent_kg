To quantify participant\u2019s eye movement pattern along the continuum between the representative patterns of group A and group B, the A-B scale was defined as (LA \u2014 LB)/(|LA| + |LB)), where LA is the log likelihood of the eye movement pattern being generated by the group A model, and LB is the log likelihood of the eye movement pattern being generated by the group B model (Chan et al., 2018). The larger the A-B scale, the more similar the pattern is to the representative pattern of group A, and vice versa for the representative pattern of group B.\n\na\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n36\n\nAmong the participants, a significant positive correlation was observed between A-B scale and gaze cascade effect as measured by the average probability looking at the chosen item from the onset of the effect (1000 ms prior to the response) to the end (r = .50, p = .012). In other words, the more similar participants\u2019 eye movement patterns during the preference- biased period to the representative pattern of group A, the stronger their gaze cascade effects.", "type": "Document"}}
