In power transfer applications however, the PCB transformers have to be shielded to comply with EMC regulations. Investigations of planar transformer shielded with ferrite sheets have been reported and the energy efficiency of a PCB transformer shielded with ferrite sheets can be higher than 90% in Megahertz operating frequency range. However, as will be discussed below, the present inventors have found that using only thin ferrite materials for EMI shielding is not effective and the EM fields the thin ferrite sheets\n\nFIG. 6 plots the tangential and normal components magnetic field intensity near the boundary between ferrite plate and free space in a PCB transformer of the prior\n\nFIG. 7 is a plot of the field intensity vector of a PCB transformer according to the embodiment of FIGS. 3(a)\n\nFIG. 8 plots the tangential and normal components magnetic field intensity near the copper sheet in a PCB transformer according to the embodiment of FIGS. 3(a) and \u00a9),\n\nPRIOR ART\n\nFIG. 9 is shows the simulated field intensity or a transformer without shielding and in no load condition,", "type": "Document"}}
