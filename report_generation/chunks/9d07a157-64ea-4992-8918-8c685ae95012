If the charging platform is placed on a metallic desk, the AC flux generated in the charging platform may induce currents in the metallic desk, resulting in incorrect energy transfer and even heating effects in the metallic desk. U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,364 describes an effective electromagnetic shield for this type of planar charging platform. The electro- magnetic shield of U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,364 simply consists of a thin layer of soft magnetic material (such as ferrite) and a in layer of conductive material (such as copper). \u4e8c\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/189,097, filed Jul. 25, 2005, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThis invention relates to rechargeable batteries for use portable electronic devices, and in particular to a battery circuit and structure for use in a device intended to be used. with a planar inductive charging platform.", "type": "Document"}}
