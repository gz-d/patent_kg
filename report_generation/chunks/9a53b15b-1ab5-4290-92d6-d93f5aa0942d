Specifically, spatiotemporally modulated metasurface may add a time dimension into conventional metasurface design, to enable various physical phenomena and wave manipulations in frequency-momentum spaces. However, to date, only lim- ited controls are validated for spatiotemporally modulated metasurfaces. Inventors of the present invention have real- ized that existing spatiotemporally modulated metasurface techniques may not be used to enable control of all funda- mental properties of EM waves using a radiation aperture, in particular to realize simultaneously and independently pro- grammable radiation characteristics.\n\n[0130] The following embodiments of the invention con- cern a universal metasurface antenna operable to control all\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nof the five fundamental properties of radiated EM waves,", "type": "Document"}}
