As an example, in yet other non-limiting implementations, given the power requirements, physical spacing considerations, reflector geometry, solar energy duty cycle, and so on, the location or placement of the communications antenna (or portions thereof) can be varied in order to maximize the reflected communications signals, to maximize collection and transmission of the incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.), to or affect any other desired design tradeoff between these and/or other considerations. Exemplary Solar Energy Collection Antenna Systems\n\nAs described above with reference to FIGS. 1-16, various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter provide systems that can facilitate solar energy collection and use in commu- nications systems. As an example, FIG. 17 illustrates an exemplary non-limiting functional block diagram of embodi- ments of a GA system, suitable for employing implementa- tions of the disclosed subject matter. For instance, an exem- plary solar energy collection system 1700 can be adapted to power an associated communications antenna. For example, solar energy collection system 1700 can comprise a commu- nications antenna 1702 (e.g. GA 300, GA 500, etc.) config- ured to reflect a portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.) thereby resulting in reflected solar radiation, as described above regarding FIGS. 3-6. For instance, communications antenna 1702 configured can be configured to include reflective elements 1704 (e.g., ground. plane 108, a non-planar reflective ground plane such as V-shaped concave ground plane 304, U-shaped concave ground plane 504, and the like, reflective antenna elements such as one or more SPAs 102, etc.).", "type": "Document"}}
