In specific embodiments, the individual\u2019s preference choice 1s inferred from the individual\u2019s eye movement fixations measured in the last 10 seconds before the choice response. In preferred embodiments, the individual\u2019s preference choice is inferred from the individual\u2019s eye movement fixations measured in the last 8 seconds before the choice response. In other preferred embodiments, the individual\u2019s preference choice is inferred from the individual\u2019s eye movement fixations measured ln the last 6 seconds before the choice response. In more preferred embodiments, the individual\u2019s preference choice is inferred from the individual\u2019s eye movement fixations measured in the last 4 seconds before the choice response. In most preferred embodiments, the individual\u2019s preference choice is inferred from the individual\u2019s eye movement fixations measured in the last 2 seconds before the choice response.\n\nAdvantageously, the instant methods enable the measurement of individual differences in eye movement patterns and cognitive styles during complex cognitive tasks. Furthermore, the instant methods allow the measurement of an individual\u2019s preferences significantly earlier than previously used methods. Specifically, the instant methods enable a measurement of an individual\u2019s choice preference with only the first 75% of fixations that precede the choice.\n\nAdvantageously, the accuracy in inferring an individual\u2019s preference choices using the methods of the instant invention, particularly using EMSHMM, is significantly higher than that using, e.g., EMHMM.\n\nFurthermore, the EMHMM with co-clustering of the invention can be used to infer an individual\u2019s cognitive style and/or cognitive abilities.", "type": "Document"}}
