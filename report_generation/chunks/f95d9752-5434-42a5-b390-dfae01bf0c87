The interactive wearable device of claim 1, further comprising:\n\na memory module having a classification machine learn- ing (ML) model configured for classifying the move- ment event, a first ML model configured for recogniz- ing one or more known microgestures performed by the first and second fingers, and a second ML model configured for providing a regression result of estimat- ing a position of the second finger on the first finger in an one-dimensional (1D) continuous movement per- formed by the first and second fingers; and\n\nprocessor coupled to the detector and the memory module, wherein the processor is configured with pro- cessor-executable instructions to perform operations comprising:\n\na\n\nclassifying the movement event through the classifica- tion ML model to determine if the movement event is a negative event or a positive event; and\n\nEach of the functional units and modules in accordance with various embodiments also may be implemented in distributed computing environments and/or Cloud comput- ing environments, wherein the whole or portions of machine instructions are executed in distributed fashion by one or more processing devices interconnected by a communica- tion network, such as an intranet, Wide Area Network (WAN), Local Area Network (LAN), the Internet, and other forms of data transmission medium.\n\nThe foregoing description of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and descrip- tion.
