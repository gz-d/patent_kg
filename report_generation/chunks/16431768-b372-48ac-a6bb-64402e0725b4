FIGURE 1A shows a holistic eye movement pattern on the left and an analytical eye movement pattern on the right. FIGURE 1B shows a correlation of holistic and analytic eye movements with age. FIGURE 1C shows the fixation heat maps of old participants on the left and of young participants on the nght.\n\nFIGURE 2 shows an example of EMHMM with co-clustering of the invention. Circles indicate ROIs.\n\nand\n\nFIGURE 3 shows histograms of symmetric KL (SKL) divergence between Group Group 2 strategies on vehicle or animal images.\n\nFIGURES 4A-C show examples of eye movement strategies. FIGURE 4A shows example stimuli. FIGURE 4B shows eye movement strategies for the 2 groups on the stimuli where the 2 groups use strategies that have a larger difference on the first 2 images and use strategies with a smaller difference on the last 2 images as measured by symmetric KL divergence (SKL). FIGURE 4C shows heat map plots of eye fixations on the first image for the 2 groups and the difference regions in orange for Group 1 and blue for Group 2.\n\nFIGURES 5A-F show correlation analyses. FIGURE 5A shows the correlation between EF scale and average number of fixations. FIGURE 5B shows the correlation between EF scale and average saccade length. FIGURE SC shows the correlation between EF scale and preference rating. FIGURE 5D shows the correlation between EF scale and scene recognition performance in d\u2019. Figure 5E shows the correlation between EF scale and Flanker Congruent Acc. Figure SF shows the correlation between EF scale and TOL planning time before execution.", "type": "Document"}}
