The second network portion includes four substantially identical arc-shaped patches 106B spaced apart angularly and evenly a circular trajectory (a virtual circle). Each of the arc-shaped patches 106B connected at its anticlockwise end with a via 116 (e.g. via hole) that extends through the first and second substrate layers 104A, 104B. The vias 116 are connected with a power combining-dividing network 110B and a 50Q radially extending microstrip line 110C of the microstrip line net- work 110. As shown in FIG. 1D, the power combining- dividing network 100B (combine and divide depending on signal flow direction) has four sections each corresponding to the respective arc-shaped patches 106B, and a combining- dividing section. The combining-dividing section, shaped like two T-junctions connected with each other, is arranged to connect the four sections with the microstrip line 110C, to combine the signals from the four sections or to split a signal into the four sections. The radial microstrip line 110C elongated and has a width W,,,. The radial microstrip line 110C has a first end that is spaced apart from the center of the second substrate layer 104B and a second end at the edge of the second substrate layer 104B for connection with an external probe or connector (the second end provides a TE", "type": "Document"}}
