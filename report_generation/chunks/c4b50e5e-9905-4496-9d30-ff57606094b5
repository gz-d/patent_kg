When a droplet spreads on the PTFE surface loaded with sufficient negative charges, the base contact area with the PTFE dynamically varies as a function of time. A capacitor Cp is formed with the water/PTFE as the top plate and PTFE/ITO as the bottom plate, respectively. For a specific water/PTFE contact area, the voltage across the capacitor can be expressed as da,/ep, where op, \u20acp and d are the surface charge density, the dielectric constant and the thickness of the PTFE, respec- tively. At the water/PTFE interface, there exists an addi- tional capacitor, C,. Prior to the contact of the impinging droplet with the drain electrode, there is no capacitor formed at the water/drain interface. As a result, Cp and Ci stay in an open-circuit and there is no charge flow between them (Extended Data FIG. 10a). In contrast, with the connection of the drain electrode and PTFE rendered by the gating liquid (switching-on mode), the other capacitor C, is estab- lished at the water/drain interface. Thus, C,, together with C, and C,, form a close-circuit. In this circuit, the time dependent capacitance of Cp, C, and C, and can be\n\nREFERENCE\n\n[0081] The following references are incorporated in their entirety and a skilled person is considered to be aware disclosure of these references.\n\n[0082] 1 Lin, Z.-H., Cheng, G., Lee, S., Pradel, K.
