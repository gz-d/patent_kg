By loading the animate\n\nSTC matrices (also referred to as \u201cSTC films\u201d), the universal metasurface antenna 400 can directly generate the modu- lated waveform with time-varying amplitude and phase properties, mapping to the desired digital information stream to be transmitted (FIG. 18). FIG. 18 also presents the measured decoded constellation diagrams and eye diagrams at the receiver end when the information is carried at the m=+1 and m=0 harmonic frequencies. The information manipulation functionality of the universal metasurface antenna 400 is validated for different information modula- tion schemes, including phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) (FIGS. 34 and 35), which demand the time-varying phase and the time-varying amplitude and phase properties, respectively. Existing trans- mitters typically rely on the heterodyne architecture con- sisting of a series of active/passive RF modules (including digital to analog converters, modulators, mixers, filters, phase shifters, and antenna arrays) to generate such modu- lated wayes in free space to mould the propagating waves with time-varying amplitude and phase (information-car- ried) properties. In contrast, the universal metasurface antenna 400, as a single assembly or device, can directly generate identical modulated waves in a single step. This provides a different communication paradigm in the physical layer with advantages of a simpler structure, higher integra-\n\ntion, lower cost, and/or lower power consumption.", "type": "Document"}}
