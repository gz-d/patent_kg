The barrier con- trol component 110 can transmit the corresponding contro signal to the barrier component 108 to facilitate controlling the barrier component 108 to select the display mode corre- sponding to the control signal. In some implementations, the barrier control component 110 can continuously maintain transmission of the same control signal over multiple visual! images 104. In other implementations, the barrier contro. component 110 can communicate a control signal to the bar- rier component 108 and afterwards can discontinue transmis- sion of the control signal (e.g., in response to a communica- tion from the barrier component 108 indicating that the desired display mode has been selected and implemented), which can reduce power consumption by the barrier contro. component 110. The barrier component 108 can continue to operate in that desired display mode (e.g., corresponding to the control signal), regardless of whether it continues to receive the control signal from the barrier control component 110, until the barrier component 108 receives a different", "type": "Document"}}
