A 3D geometric illustration is also provided in FIG. 9A. Briefly, a soft mold was created from a master containing a set of closed-loop structures with fixed height h-15 ym, and different lengths 1. Thus, the interfacial area of the crack can be expressed as A, =hl. The mold was used to create replicas made of materials with various flexural strengths (0). It is imaginable that in the demolding process the replica material has to be stiff enough to endure the drag during releasing through a crack in the mold. The replica loop structure with low o and large 1 were observed to be misshaped because of the drag during releas- ing from the mold through the cracks. Thus, the maximum length of the faithful replicas was measured and recorded as the yield point of the material with specific a (FIG. 9B). At the yield point, the critical force can be expressed as F,=nor\u2018/l, where is the flexural strength of the replica material, and r is the radius of the closed loops (r=2.5 jum). The critical force F, is found to be proportional to A, (that is, or/I~hl) as plotted in FIG. 2D, indicating a good\n\nit\n\n[0081]\n\nFIG. 1A and FIG. 1E schematically illustrate the\n\nlithography process.\n\ncreation of hierarchical structures.\n\n[0083]\n\nThe controlled formation of crack\n\nfor CECE should\n\ntribution and the deformation shift to the bottom layer.\n\nconfigurability of the sealing/opening of the elastic crack.\n\nApr. 29 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0122091 A1\n\n6\n\nwas achieved , which has surpassed most of the previous\n\nThus , for a given elastic crack , the required minimum\n\nworks . a more complicated two - cycle helix structure with\n\nflexural strength of the replica material can be calculated\n\nthrough o hl\u00ba / str for guiding the material option .
