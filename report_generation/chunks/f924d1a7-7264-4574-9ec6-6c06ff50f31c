In detail, for each of the microgesture training data sets, the temporal gradient operation is performed, by the\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nFIG. 10 shows a testing accuracy of each of the known microgestures with different models and under different evaluation. Referring to FIG. 10, \u201cW\u201d represents within- wearer evaluation, \u201cL\u201d represents a leave-3-wearer-out evaluation, \u201cT\u201d represents a temporal gradient feature set, \u201cC\u201d represents a channel-wise gradient feature set, and \u201cT+C\u201d represents a mix gradient. The upper part in the FIG.\n\n10 shows the models trained with feature sets in the time domain, and the lower part in the FIG. 10 focuses on the evaluation in the frequency domain.\n\nIn some embodiments, during the evaluation of the gen- eralizability of the gesture classification using the trained ML model ML1, two data-splitting schemes 1, 2 are applied. 14 wearers are asked to participate the evaluation. Data sets measured from all 14 wearers are used as within-wearer evaluation, with the split of 3:1:1 for the training, the validation, and the testing data respectively. Then, the selected ML model is trained with the microgesture data sets\n\nin\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nset\n\nUS 11,822,732 B1\n\n13\n\n14\n\nmeasured from 11 wearers. The selected ML model is tested on 3 left-out wearers as a leave-three-wearer-out evaluation. The 3 left-out wearers are selected based on their signal quality. Specifically, it is calculated the average SNR for data set of each of wearers, and 3 wearers are picked whose SNRs are three lowest as three leave-three-out testing data- set. During the leave-three-out evaluation, it is used a random 30% subset of the microgesture training data sets as the validation data sets.", "type": "Document"}}
