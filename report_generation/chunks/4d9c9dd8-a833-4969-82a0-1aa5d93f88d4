For instance, an exemplary non-limiting embodiment of GA 300 can be fabricated and tested using, for example, exemplary SPA elements 102 and a plurality of Wilkinson power divid- ers 1400. In addition, ground plane 304 of exemplary non- limiting embodiment of GA 300 can comprise conducting plates (e.g., 2 pieces of conducting plates each with a size of L,xW,). As can be seen from FIG. 21, the measured antenna gain 2102 with 2106 the one or more solar cell 302 panels at GHz is approximately 11.2 dBi, which is slightly lower than that without 2108 the one or more solar cell panels 302 (12.4 dBi). Thus, FIG. 21 demonstrates that for an exemplary non- limiting GA 300, loss introduced by the one or more panels 302 is relatively negligible.\n\nIn addition, at 2004, a portion of an incident RF signal, an incident microwave signal, or an incident millimeter-wave signal can be reflected to create a reflected communications signal. For example, methodologies 2000 can further include reflecting a portion (e.g., via one or more selective transmis- sion layer(s) such as coating or overlay 802, etc.) of one or more of an incident Radio Frequency RF signal, an incident microwave signal, or an incident millimeter-wave signal thereby creating a reflected communications signal.", "type": "Document"}}
