[0013] Preferably there may be provided a secondary energy receiving element comprising a second coil formed in a plane parallel to the soft magnetic sheet and wherein the second coil is connected in parallel with the first coil. This second coil may be formed on a printed circuit board which may be fixed to said soft magnetic sheet. [0014] In another embodiment of the invention the en- ergy receiving element may comprise a coil formed on a printed circuit board. [0015] The invention also extends to an electronic de- vice powered by a battery pack as described above. [0016] According to a further aspect of the present in- vention there is provided an energy receiving element adapted to be fixed to a battery pack to enable said bat- tery pack to be charged from a planar inductive battery charging system, characterized in that said energy re- ceiving element comprises a generally planar thin soft magnetic sheet and a first coil wound around the edge of said sheet such that the coil lies in a plane defined by said magnetic sheet, and in that the energy receiving element further comprises a capacitor, the energy receiv- ing element having an inductance and forming a resonant tank with the capacitor, and a diode rectifier and a DC capacitor to provide a rectified DC voltage that can be fed from the energy receiving element to a battery charg- ing circuit of the battery pack\n\n[0009] Problem (1) can be solved by using a planar inductive charging platform based on a multilayer planar winding array structure, which allows the charged elec- tronic equipment to be placed anywhere on the charging surface as described in WO03/105308. The present in- vention addresses problem (2) and provides a simple and more effective secondary device to enable energy transfer between the primary planar charging platform and the secondary module more effectively at a much lower operating frequency (eg as low as 100 kHz).\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
