The hardware accelerator contains four modules, such as a hybrid NTT/INTT transformation module 102A, a PWM module 102B, a PWA module 102C and a SHAKE module 102D. Each module may operate independently, the architecture and the operation of these modules will be described later in this disclosure. In addi- tion, all modules work with the input and output FIFOs 108, which are included for temporally storing the computational data before and after computation performed by the hard- ware accelerator modules. The module control logic 112 is an arbiter designed to convey control information between\n\nthe PS and different acceleration modules.\n\n[0060] On the PS side, the software processor 104 accesses the data in the DDR for computation. The processor may include a cache to store temporary data for acceleration. The IRQ port may be used to answer the interrupt request\n\n[0064] Preferably, the design configurability is achieved through control registers 110, which are used to convey control signals and design parameters. The four control registers 110 are defined as shown in the following table.", "type": "Document"}}
