The beakers were each filled with 3 mL pure deionized water, while the 24-well microplate 101 was filled with 1 mL DI water per well, and stored in minus 20 degrees Celsius. The microplate 101 and the beakers were stored in minus 20 degrees Celsius for 10 hours to produce a plurality of ice templates.\n\n[0060] Results from using the ice-templates made in bea- kers are labelled \u201ctemplate-1\u201d. Results from using the ice- templates made using the 24-well microplate 101 are labelled \u201ctemplate-2\u201d.\n\n[0061] The chemical structure of curcumin molecule was shown in FIG. 9. Curcumin was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to produce solutions of concentrations of 1, 5, 10, mg/ml.

When applying the solution onto the ice templates, the ice templates were placed on an ice pedestal order to avoid melting of ice templates.\n\nin", "type": "Document"}}
