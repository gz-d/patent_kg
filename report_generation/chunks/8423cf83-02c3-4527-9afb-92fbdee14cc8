Specifically, FIG. 18 shows the universal metasurface antenna 400 used to directly generate the information-carried EM waves in free space. FIG. 18 also shows the measured decoded constellation diagrams and eye diagrams at the receiver end with QPSK at the m=+1 harmonic frequency (left) and 16QAM at the fundamental frequency (right), as well as the one-to-one mapping relationship among the transmitted digital infor- mation stream, the radiated information-carried waves in the free space (2PSK in this example), and the applied animate STC matrices (STC films) for communications at the m=+1 harmonic frequency. The required STC films for other modulation schemes and at the fundamental frequency are presented in FIGS. 34 and 35. FIG. 19 illustrates the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for directly generating two independently modulated waves carrying different digital data streams. Two designated users at dif- ferent locations can simultaneously and independently receive the information from the universal metasurface antenna. In this example, the required STC films for multi- channels are shown in FIG. 37. FIG. 20 shows the measured. radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna 400 at the m=-1 (CH1) and m=-2 (CH2) harmonic frequencies. The insets on the right in FIG. 20 present the measured decoded constellation diagrams of the two channels at the receiver end. More results about multiplexing in different beam directions are presented in FIGS. 38 and 39. FIG. 21 illustrates the universal metasurface antenna 400 with the inherent direction modulation property at the fundamental frequency. In this example, only the target user in the main beam direction can successfully decode the information, whereas eavesdroppers at other positions totally lose the information. FIG. 21 shows the measured radiation pattern", "type": "Document"}}
