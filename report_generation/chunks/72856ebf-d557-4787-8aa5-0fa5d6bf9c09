Preferably, the laser pulses are femtosecond laser pulses. The device may be incorporated in an electron microscope, preferably a trans- mission electron microscope (e.g., femtosecond transmis- sion electron microscope), for providing a field emission source that provides electrons or electron beams for micros- copy.\n\n[0015] In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, arranging a metallic arrangement at the tip comprises coating a metallic layer on the tip. The coating may be performed using electron beam evaporation or pulsed laser deposition. In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, arranging a metallic arrange- ment at the tip comprises coating a plurality of metallic layers on the tip. The plurality of metallic layers can be of the same metallic material or of different metallic materials.\n\n[0007] In accordance with a second aspect of the inven- tion, there is provided an electron source comprising: a device for providing electrons and an energy source. The device includes an optical fiber with a tip and a metallic arrangement arranged at the tip and arranged to be excited by an energy source to emit electrons or electron beams. The energy source is arranged to provide energy to the device to cause emission of electrons from the metallic arrangement. The electron source may be a field emission source. The tip is preferably sized in micro-scale, more preferably in nano- scale. The tip may include a rounded end. The rounded end may have a radius of less than 100 nm.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0016] Embodiments of the invention will now described, by way of example, with reference to the accom- drawings in which:\n\n[0008] lic\n\nmetal-\n\na\n\nbe\n\npanying\n\nApr. 8 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0104376 A1\n\n2\n\nportion of the optical fiber to form a tip , and an optical", "type": "Document"}}
