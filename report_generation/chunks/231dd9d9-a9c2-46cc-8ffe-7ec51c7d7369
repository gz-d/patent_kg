Therefore, depth map and its discontinuities can be utilized to detect the flicker distortion. We use the edge detection operator, e.g., canny, to detect the depth edges of the synthesized depth image and a large threshold is used to get the strong depth edges. The depth edges in the depth map is presented as EB, y={D\u00b0*\"(x.y,DIL <x <W, 1<y <H, tk}.\n\n[0099] a synthesized with original video and depth video, a temporal layer generated by the horizontal line in FIG. 5A, and related gradient maps with and without horizontal gradients in temporal layer of static objects. It can be observed that the gradient map with horizontal and vertical gradients in FIG. 5C and the gradient map with horizontal gradients in FIG. 5D have strong strengths in rectangle areas while the gra- dient map with vertical gradients in FIG. 5E has very weak features. As shown in FIGS. 5C to 5E, the static objects can generate strong horizontal gradients that reflect no mean- ingful motion information, thus affecting the true flicker distortion detection. In addition, if flicker distortion exists along the boundaries of the static object, the vertical gradient", "type": "Document"}}
