The electromagnetic actuation system includes one or more pairs of electromag- netic devices. Each electromagnetic device includes an elongated sleeve that defines a hollow space and has an external surface, an electric coil wounded onto the external surface of the elongated sleeve, a magnetic core, and actua- tion means for actuating a relative movement between the magnetic core and the elongated sleeve. The method com- prises grouping the one or more pairs of electromagnetic devices into one or more groups; forming activation strat- egies for the one or more groups, the activation strategies including one or more of section of which groups are to be activated, values of energizing current for each electric coil, direction of the energizing current, and distance between each magnetic core and the center of the workspace; and. generating the gradient-enhanced magnetic field by adopting the activation strategies for the one or more groups.\n\n[0007] Other example embodiments are discussed herein.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0008] FIG. 1 illustrates a system for generating a mag- field according to certain embodiments of the present invention.\n\nnetic\n\n[0009] FIG. 2A illustrates an electromagnetic device for generating a magnetic field in a workspace according to certain embodiments of the present invention.\n\n[0010] FIG. 2B is an exploded view of the electromagnetic device of FIG. 2A.\n\n[0011] FIG. 3A illustrates an electromagnetic device actuation means according to certain embodiments of invention.\n\npresent\n\nwith the\n\n[0012] FIG. 3B is a cross-sectional view of the electro- magnetic device of FIG. 3A, where the electromagnetic device is substantially symmetric relative to the cross sec- tion as illustrated in FIG. 3B.", "type": "Document"}}
