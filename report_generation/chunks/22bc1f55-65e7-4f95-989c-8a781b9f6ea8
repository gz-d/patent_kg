In some examples, a current source may be used.\n\nThe voltage compensation signal may be provided by linear-type voltage source. This is advantageous for applications.\n\nPreferably, the means for generating the compensating is arranged to amplify the difference signal.\n\nThe voltage compensation signal may be provided by switching-type voltage source. This is advantageous for high power applications, because of the high conversion efficiency the switching-type voltage source.\n\nThe sensed output voltage may comprise a voltage signal sensed across an output capacitor component of said regula- said output capacitor component being arranged in par- with an output load impedance of said regulator.\n\nAlternatively, the sensed output signal comprises a signal sensed at an output of an output inductor component of said regulator, said output inductor component being arranged in series with an output load impedance of said regulator. The compensator circuit of the present invention is advantageous in that it can be employed with any type of passive output component. 40 45\n\nThe compensating signal may comprise a voltage compen- sation signal applied in series to said output capacitor\n\nThe voltage compensation signal may comprise a linear- type voltage source.\n\nThe voltage compensation signal may comprise a switch- ing-type voltage source.
