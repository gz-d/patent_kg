In this example a passive ballast for an LED system is shown provided with a diode rectifier, a valley-fill circuit for reducing the voltage ripple of the recti- fied DC power, and a filter inductor L for generating a current source provided to the LED load. It will be understood that as described above the inductor L could instead by replaced by acurrent ripple reduction circuit comprising a coupled induc- tor with a capacitor. In this circuit an input inductor L, is provided in series between the AC supply Vs and the diode rectifier which as will be explained below provides the nec- control.\n\nIt can be seen that a large inductance can reduce the current ripple and LED power variation. The choice of L depends also on the core loss and copper loss in the inductor. The overall design therefore relies on the thermal design as explained in Hui et al and the choice of L so that the operating range can be restricted to the region of the luminous flux\u2014LED power curve where the slope of the curve is small.\n\nAneffective method to further reduce the current ripple and thus LED power variation and light variation is to replace the inductor in FIG. 9 and FIG. 12 with a current-ripple cancel- lation means in the form ofa coupled inductor and a capacitor as shown in FIG. 14. FIG. 15(a) and FIG. 15(6) show the electrical measurements of the system. It can be seen the variations in the LED current ripple and power have been greatly reduced. The power variation is only within 0.2 W (from 1.9 W to 2.1 W). This 9% power variation will lead to less than 4% of light variation in the two examples as shown in FIG, 15(c) and FIG. 15(d).", "type": "Document"}}
