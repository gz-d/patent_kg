The evaluation is conducted by comparing the computing time between the pure software and software/hardware co-design. In terms of the pure software implementation, the ARM Cortex-A9 processor is used by turning the processor\u2019s cache on and off. This is because in the Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios, the energy eflicient processors might not have cache support. In order to shed light on applications in different types of embedded devices, the acceleration results were tested when the cache is turned on and turned off and the results are as shown in the following Table.\n\nfactor increases the SW/HW time. For example, the tested function point_wise_mul (k=6) consumes significantly more time when the cache is on, due to the long data flush time. On the other hand, DMA preparation time is shorter if the cache is on, which is the factor to decrease the total execution time. This helps to explain why the time of the H356(32, 96) function is shorter when the cache is on.", "type": "Document"}}
