The trans- parent mode can be employed to have the barrier pattern be transparent so that it can pass normal 2-D video content through without affecting the 2-D video content to preserve visual quality. The partially opaque mode can be one of a number of different barrier pattern types, as more fully dis- closed herein, and enhanced 2-D video content can be passed through the partially opaque barrier pattern to convert the enhanced 2-D video content into 3-D video content (e.g., video content comprising a reconstructed 3-D scene). Fur- ther, there can be a plurality of different barrier patterns that can be utilized by the barrier component 108, wherein for example, the different barrier patterns can employ respective partially opaque barrier patterns that can be used to process respective types of enhanced 2-D content when ina specified partially opaque mode (in addition to being able to pass though 2-D content when in transparent barrier pattern", "type": "Document"}}
