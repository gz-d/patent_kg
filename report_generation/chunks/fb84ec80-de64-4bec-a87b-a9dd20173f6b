Another\n\ncharacteristic of the\n\ndevice\n\n[0162] unique present is that the constituent materials are bioresorbable within a defined time frame when exposed to biofluids around sub- cutaneous tissue. FIG. 6A shows the states of the present device at various times following immersion in PBS solution at 37\u00b0 C. Constituent materials dissolve within 1 month and all remaining residues almost disappear after 7 weeks. A similar degradation process of the present device is observed in the rats after therapy. FIG. 6B shows that the present device is surrounded by a fibrous capsule and gradually degraded in vivo. Metal foils and coating are initially fully degraded (about 2 weeks), leaving the PLGA residues in rats. After 12 weeks, the size of the remaining PLGA residues is only around 3 mm, indicating the successful bioresorbable process. The tissue around the implantations is further histologically sectioned and stained with H&E to analyze the biocompatibility of the devices. The degraded PLGA is surrounded by fibrous capsule, where the fibrosis layers around the implanted devices become thinner with the increasing implantation period (FIG. 6C), and the decreasing number of inflammatory cells indicates that the inflamma- tion is alleviated after a long-term implantation of the\n\npresent device\n\n(FIG. 6D).\n\n[0163] Although the invention has been described in terms certain embodiments, other embodiments apparent those of ordinary skill in the art are also within the scope invention.
