In the field simulation, the primary side of the transformer is excited with a 3 MHz 3A current source. However, the output of the magnetic field transducer in the EMC scanner will be clipped when the amplitude of the high-frequency field intensity is too large. Thus, the 3 MHz 3A current source is approximated as a small signal (0.1A) 3 MHz source superimposed into a 3A DC source because the field transducer cannot sense DC source. In the mea- surement setup, a magnetic field transducer for detecting vertical magnetic field is located at 5 mm below the PCB transformer.\n\nthe magnetic field intensity can be expressed as\n\n2 1 \u5df2 H=-\u2014 YX \u4e86 our\n\n25\n\nwhere w, 4 and o are the angular frequency, permeability and conductivity of the medium, respectively. Because cop- per is a good conductor (o=5.80x107 S/m) and the operating frequency of the PCB transformer is very high (a few megahertz), from (7), the magnetic field intensity, H, inside the copper sheet is extremely small. Accordingly, the normal component of the H-field inside the copper sheet is also small. Furthermore, from (3), at the ferrite-copper boundary, the normal component of the H-field inside the ferrite plate is 80 times less than that inside the copper sheet. As a result, the normal component of the H-field inside the ferrite plate can be suppressed drastically.\n\nPCB Transformer Without Shielding", "type": "Document"}}
