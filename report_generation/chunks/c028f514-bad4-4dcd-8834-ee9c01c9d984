(x, y) are the positions of the dielectric posts of Metalens #2 in the local coordinate system L2. r and a are the radial and azimuth angles of the i\u201d considered focus in the coordinate system L2, respectively. @,,. is the incident phase of Metalens #2, and CO is a reference phase which is a phase constant added to all the pixels on the aperture of Metalens #2. It is worth stressing that the phase constant for different focal positions can be different and can be optimized to minimize the aperture phase errors among all the considered foci. Since the titled plane wave from Metalens #1 is the incident field of Metalens #2, \u00a2,,.\u2018 can be calculated by\n\n5 oft, = \u4eba eof \u5165 + sin) \u00b0\n\nwhere (0,,., Pine\u201d) is the direction of the incident wave in terms of the coordinate system L, for the i\u201d focusing case. From (4) and (5), one can observe that once the considered physical rotation angles (or a) of Metalens #2 is chosen, the positions of all the pixels and the angles of the incident aperture phase distribution are fixed and the desired com- pensation phase only depends on r\u00ae and C\u00ae. The known quantity of (4) and (5) for the considered four focusing cases are listed in Table ITT:\n\nTABLE II\n\nKnown parameters and the optimized radials and reference phases of the four focusing cases.
