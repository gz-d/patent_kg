Fig.10 shows a practical example of a charging platform with such an auxiliary winding excited in the same way as the first primary coil. It can be seen that the voltage sag is greatly reduced. This experimental result confirms the improvement of the charging ability of the charging platform due to the auxiliary winding. [0025] It will be understood that the flux generated by the first primary winding is greater than the flux generated by the auxiliary second winding. The purpose of the sec- ond winding is to compensate for the voltage sag phe- nomenon and therefore the second winding is driven such that it generates sufficient flux to provide this com- pensation without going too far and resulting in a voltage peak where the second winding is located. [0026] It will be understood that a number of variations on the embodiment illustrated in Fig.8B are possible. For example the principal and auxiliary primary windings may be formed either as conductive coils or may be formed as conductive tracks on a printed circuit board (PCB). The principal and auxiliary windings may preferably be formed in the same plane (for example if they are formed on the same PCB), or may be formed in parallel but slight- ly spaced apart planes. In addition, while the windings are shown in Figs.8A and 8B in a rectangular form this is not essential and the windings may take other shapes such as circular windings. [0027] The auxiliary winding should be located at or close to the part of the charging surface where the voltage sag occurs. Generally this may be in the center of the platform, but depending on the design of the principal winding if the sag occurs elsewhere then the auxiliary winding should be located correspondingly. Generally one auxiliary winding may be sufficient to compensate for the voltage sag but if not, for example if the charging surface is particularly large, then two or more auxiliary windings may be employed.", "type": "Document"}}
