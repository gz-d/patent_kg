The information handling system may have different configura- tions, and it generally comprises suitable components nec- essary to receive, store, and execute appropriate computer instructions, commands, or codes. The main components of the information handling system are a processor and a memory 204. The processor may be formed by one or more CPU, MCU, controllers, logic circuits, Raspberry Pi chip, etc. The memory 204 may include one or more volatile memory unit (such as RAM, DRAM, SRAM), one or more non-volatile unit (such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FRAM, MRAM, FLASH, SSD, NAND, and NVDIMM), or of their combinations.\n\n(schematically represented) is arranged between the filament 102 and the electrode 106. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 is connected with a control circuit 200, which in turn connects to a low potential terminal of the power supply 108. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 is arranged at an electric potential to provide an electric field to control emission of electron beams 50 from the filament 102. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 has a lower potential relative to the filament 102. The Wehnelt cylinder 110 generates an electric field to control the electron emission area of the filament 102 and to control the size or focus of the electron beam 50. The electric potential of the Wehnelt cylinder 110 (hence the electric field produced by the Wehnelt cylinder 110) can be changed by the control circuit 200 to change the electron emission area of the filament 102 and to change the size or focus of the electron beam 50. For example, the convergence or diver- gence of the emitted electron beam 50 can be controlled for different applications (e.g., for electron microscopy, for diffraction, etc.). A potential difference across the control circuit 200, i.e., the potential difference between the Wehnelt cylinder 110 and the filament 102, can be referred to as a bias", "type": "Document"}}
