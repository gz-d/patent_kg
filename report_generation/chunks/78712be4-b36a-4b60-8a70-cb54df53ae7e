In can be used to\n\nIn certain embodiments, the biodegradable metallic mate- rial can be magnesium beads. The beads can have sizes of, for example, about 100 nm, about 45 um, or about 150 ym, and can be thermally treated to help establish an oxide layer on the surface. In a specific embodiment, the thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature of about 100\u00b0 C. for a period of time of about 60 minutes. Varying the proportions of thermally treated magnesium beads to be mixed with the polymer solution can result in hybrid mate- rials of varying concentrations. The solution mixture can then be sonicated so that the beads can be aligned or dispersed evenly within the polymer substrate. Next, the mixture can undergo a drying process. In certain embodi- ments, a second thermal treatment process can be performed on the hybrid materials to enhance the mechanical properties\n\nIn certain embodiments, the polymer used can be PCL, biodegradable xylitol-based polymer, or a copolymer with one or more of y-BL, 5-VL, y-VL, and y-CL.\n\nIn an embodiment of a fabrication process, after preparing the biodegradable polymer, the biodegradable metallic material can be surface-treated. There can be more than one biodegradable metallic material, and these materials can be in different forms. The biodegradable metallic material or materials is/are subjected to a surface modification process to change the surface chemistry for hybrid material forma- tion. The modification method can be, for example, plasma immersion ion implantation or thermal treatment.", "type": "Document"}}
