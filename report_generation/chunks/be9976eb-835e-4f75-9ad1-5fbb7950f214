The first and second semiconductor elements of the first control arrange- ment may comprise semiconductor diodes, such as PIN diodes. In some examples, the first and second semiconduc- tor elements of the first control arrangement may be arranged to operate simultaneously in either the ON state or the OFF state.\n\n[0022] In some embodiments, the at least two control elements of the second control arrangement comprise a first semiconductor element and a second semiconductor element each selectively operable in an ON state and an OFF state, for affecting operation of the second slot hence the operation state of the corresponding subwavelength unit.

In some examples, the first and second semi- conductor elements of the second control arrangement may be arranged to operate simultaneously in either the ON state or the OFF state.\n\n[0023] In some embodiments, the first semiconductor ele- ment of the first control arrangement is connected across a first slot portion of the first slot and the second semicon- ductor element of the first control arrangement is connected across a second slot portion of the first slot. In some examples, the first slot portion of the first slot and the secon slot portion of the first slot are at opposite sides (e.g.\uff0c opposite long sides) of the first slot.", "type": "Document"}}
