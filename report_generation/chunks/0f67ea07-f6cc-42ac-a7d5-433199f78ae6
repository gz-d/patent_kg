One example of such a wireless platform is described in HUI, Ron, Shu-yuen, International Publication No. WO 03/105308 Al, entitled \u201cPlanar Induc- tive Battery Charger,\u201d published on Dec. 18, 2003 (hereinaf- ter referred to as \u201cWO03/105308\u201d), and which is herein incor- porated by reference in its entirety. In this design, a planar wireless charging platform is proposed upon which devices to be charged may be placed. Underneath the surface of the charging platform there is an array of primary coils that generate lines of magnetic flux that extend generally perpen- dicular to the surface of the charging platform. A device to be charged (for example, a mobile phone) is provided with an integral (or external) secondary coil so that when the device is placed on the charging surface, magnetic flux passes through the secondary coil and generates a voltage therein. The volt- age that is generated may be used to charge the battery within\n\nIn preferred embodiments of the invention the body portion may have a generally circular cross-section and the secondary winding may therefore also be circular. Examples of such products include, for example, a handheld flashlight having a basically circular body and head portion or a camera having a lens portion extending from the camera body. The invention could also, however, be applied to other devices having por- tions with other cross-sections such as oval or square cross- sections. What is critical is that the secondary winding can extend around a circumference of a portion of the device, and that the device can then be placed on the charging surface such that the secondary winding is parallel and close to the charging surface for maximum charging efficiency.", "type": "Document"}}
