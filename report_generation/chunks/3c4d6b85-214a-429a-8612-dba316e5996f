For example, it was shown that the similarity of participants\u2019 eye movement patterns during the preference-biased period to the representative pattern of group A as opposed to that of group B (as measured in A-B scale) was positively correlated with the gaze cascade effect and inference accuracy using fixations during the final 2 seconds before response. In addition to examining the relationship between eye movement patterns and other psychological measures, using methods of the instant invention it can also be determined how the eye movement pattern similarity measure 1s modulated by factors related to decision making styles, such as gender, cultural, sleep loss, etc. Using EMHMM, it was shown that eye movement pattern similarity to an eye-centered, analytic pattern during face recognition 1s associated with better recognition performance whereas similarity to a nose-centered, holistic patterns 1s correlated with cognitive decline in\n\nolder adults (see e.g., Chuk, Chan, et al., 2017; Chuk, Crookes, et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2018),\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n43", "type": "Document"}}
