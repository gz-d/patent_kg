For example, some embodiments of the invention provide a high-power terahertz electromagnetic radiation source that can be used for terahertz applications such as high-speed wireless data transmission, spectroscopy, imag- ing, and radar. For example, some embodiments of the invention use relatively low-cost CMOS technology to gen- erate and radiate high-power and high-frequency terahertz signals. For example, some embodiments of the invention can be implemented as part of an active terahertz imaging system to illuminate targeted objects, and the beam-steer- able function can reduce the imaging time. Some embodi- ments of the invention provide a THz source with steerable radiation beam. Some embodiments of the invention can be used for 5G, 6G or above wireless communication, e.g., for more than 100 Gbps data rate data transmission. Some embodiments of the invention can be used for THz imaging. Some embodiments of the invention can replace existing commercial THz extender as the source. It should be noted that some embodiments of the invention may include one or more additional or alternative functions and/or applications\n\nnot specifically described or illustrated.\n\n[0209] Some embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following example advantages. For example, the radiator unit or radiator in some embodiments may provide improved DC to terahertz conversion effi- ciency. For example, the topology of the radiator unit array in some embodiments of the invention may be scalable or suitable for implementing a large-scale array. It should be noted that some embodiments of the invention may include one or more additional or alternative advantages not spe- cifically described or illustrated.\n\n[0210]\n\nThe radiator of the invention can be provided in or", "type": "Document"}}
