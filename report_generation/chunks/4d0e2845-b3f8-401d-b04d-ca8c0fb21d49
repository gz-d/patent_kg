The TSRH system, in addition to obtaining a better correction of thoracic curves in the sagittal and coronal planes and maintaining lumbar lordosis, also provides rigidity of the implant against axial and torsional forces with its Crosslink\u2122 device. The TSRH system has been used to treat severe scoliotic curves. The Isola spinal implant sys- tem was developed from Harrington\u2019s principles and de- signs and assembled with variable screw placement sys- tem (VSP). The assembly of this implant is intended to minimize internal or external profiling and increase sta- bility and durability. However, complications associated with iliac screw breakage, transverse connector break- age and screw breakage at the end of constructs have occurred when using the Isola system. [0007] The various conventional correction systems however fail to provide complete correction of scoliotic spines. For example, conventional spinal correction sys- tems, from the earlier Harrington, Jacobs and Luque sys- tems to the later developed systems such as TSRH (SO- FAMOR DANEK, US), CD Horizons (SOFAMOR DANEK, US) and ISOLA (DePuyAcroMed, Raynbam, Massachusetts, US) and Moss Miami (DePuy AcroMed), use slightly different techniques to correct scoliosis. Such correction systems can reduce spinal deformity by only 60% to 70%, but a full correction is almost impossible. The use of excessive correction forces in attempting a full correction can cause bony fractures or neurological deficit due to spinal cord damage. [0008] Moreover, none of the conventional correction systems takes into account the viscoelastic behavior of the spine. Viscoelastic properties of the spine relate to its time dependent mechanical effect, i.e., the stiffness of spine decreases over the duration for which the force is applied. Such mechanical effect has been observed in spinal surgery, where the force required to hold tissue in", "type": "Document"}}
