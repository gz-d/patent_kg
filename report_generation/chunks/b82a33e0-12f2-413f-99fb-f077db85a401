At various bending states (60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and) 180\u00b0, the corresponding galvanostatic charge/discharge characteristics could be well-preserved with subtle changes capacity change (FIG. 21B). Moreover, no appreciable dete- rioration in specific capacity was detected after 500 bending cycles at 180\u00b0 (91.4% retention), confirming the superior stability of the AD-battery against various deformations (FIG. 21C).\n\n[0232] Regarding to the charge/discharge stability of the AD-battery, the battery showed a stable rechargeability without evident voltage changes upon cooling and heating (FIG. 16C). Even at -20\u00b0 C., the AD-battery still delivered a high specific capacity of 165 mA h g -1 (~70% of the one at 25\u00b0 C.) at 0.2 A gl manifesting the superior freeze- resistant property of the battery. At a high temperature, the discharge profiles appeared to almost overlap with that of 25\u00b0C. (FIG. 16C). These results indicate that the AD-battery can withstand a low temperature down to -20\u00b0 C. anda high temperature up to 80\u00b0 C.\n\n[0233] For the cycling performance, at 25 and -20\u00b0 C., the AD-battery exhibited 81% (124 mAh g 1 and 66% (76 mA h g\u2122') capacity retentions of its initial capacity over 500 cycles at 1.0 A gl (capacity decay rates of 0.038% and 0.068% per cycle), respectively. The Coulombic efficiencies of the AD-battery remained as high as approximately 99.5- 100.1% even at -25\u00b0 C. (FIG. 16D). Moreover, the AD- battery presented a stable rechargeability without any obvi- ous fluctuation, whereas the comparison PAM-hydrogel battery showed large augment of the voltage hysteresis upon cooling to -20\u00b0 C.
