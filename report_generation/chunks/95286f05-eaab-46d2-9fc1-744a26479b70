Hence, the chemical effects of ultrasound do not come from a direct interaction of the ultrasonic sound wave with the molecules in the solution. Thus, the term \u201cultrasonication\u201d, \u201cultrasound treatment,\u201d and \u201cultrasonic treatment\u201d are interchangeably used herein to refer a process where above 20 kHz of ultrasonic rates/ frequencies are utilized.\n\n[0041] 2. Description of the invention\n\n[0042] The present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the discovery that solder paste with micron-size particles can be produced by subjecting an alloy to ultrasonication at suitable condition (e.g., via changing temperature). Accord- ingly, the present disclosure provides a method for produc- ing Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles via ultrasonication at a first temperature and cooling at a second temperature, thus the produced Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles indepen- dently has an average diameter of less than jum.
