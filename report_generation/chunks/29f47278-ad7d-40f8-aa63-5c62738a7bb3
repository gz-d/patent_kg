To this end, the same inference task was performed using regular HMMs in the EMHMM approach. As shown in FIGURE 11, the average inference accuracy of SHMMs (M = 0.81) was higher than HMMs (M = 0.64) for subjects, t(46) = 2.71, p = 0.009, d = 0.78. A two-way ANOVA on inference accuracy was conducted with group and model (SHMM/HMM) as the independent variables. The results showed a significant main effect of group, F(1, 44) = 5.04, p = 0.03, Np = 0.096 and significant main effect of model, F(1, 44) = 8.75, p = 0.005, Np = 0.166. There was interaction between group and model, F(1, 44) = 1.91, p= .17. This result demonstrated again the advantage of EMSHMM for modeling eye movement patterns in tasks that involve cognitive state changes. FIGURE 11 shows the average inference accuracy for all participants\n\nusing SHMMs and regular HMMs when using the last 2 seconds of the trials.\n\nEXAMPLE 17- Relevance of the study results\n\np\n\nA\n\n=\n\nto\n\n.02;\n\na\n\nall\n\na\n\nno\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n40\n\nThe instant invention presents\n\nnovel method, EMSHMM, for modeling eye\n\nmovement\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
