FIGURE 4A presents 4 example images\n\nand their corresponding HMMs for the 2 groups. FIGURE 4b1 and 4b2 show two examples of eye movement strategies with large SKL difference between the 2 groups. In particular, Group 2 focused more on the foreground object, while Group 1 explored the image, looking at both the foreground object and the background. In addition, while looking at an animal, Group 2 focused more on the eyes, whereas Group 1 looked at the nose (FIGURE 4c). FIGURES 4b3 and 4b4 show examples where the 2 groups had similar eye movement strategies. In general, larger differences in eye movements occurred on images where the foreground object (animal or car) was salient as compared with the background, e.g., an animal among trees, or a car on a road. This indicates that animals are more salient than vehicles, and that animal images generally induce larger differences in eye movement strategies than vehicle images. In contrast, images with cluttered backgrounds and non- interesting foreground objects typically induced similar eye movement strategies. Group 1 and 2 strategies are referred to as the explorative and focused strategy, respectively, and the cluster score between the two strategies as the Explorative-Focused (EF) scale. Indeed, participants using the explorative strategy had a larger average number of fixations, t(59) = 3.793, p<.001, and longer saccade lengths, t(59) = 4.881, p < .001, than those using the focused strategy (Table 1 below), and the more similar their eye movement pattern to the explorative strategy (in EF scale), the larger the average number of fixations, r(60) = .477, p < .001, and saccade length, r(60) = .544, p < 0.001 (FIGURES 5a-e). As EMHMM does not use sequence length information, the difference in average number of fixations emerged the result of the These results consistent with the\n\nnaturally as", "type": "Document"}}
