As a result, by combining these two movements, the focus can be steered at arbitrary position on the focal plane within the FoV (i.e., realize 2D focus steering). For dem- onstration purpose, the metalens doublet is rotated to steers its focus along a \u201cp\u2019\u2019-shaped moving trajectory (Ge., along the diagonal direction and the circular trace with a radius of 4.6 mm) The simulated results are shown in FIG. 14(4), which is obtained by adding the simulated power densities on the focal plane for all the focus steering cases. A nice 2D focus-steering performance can be observed. Although one focus moving trajectory is presented in FIG. 14(c), the metalens doublet can actually steer its focus at any position on the focal plane within the FoV. Combining the in-plane rotation of the metalens doublet and linear translation of\n\nmetalens #2, the metalens can realize 3D focus steering.\n\n[0060] FIG. 14(e) simulates power densities on three focal planes (S=0.5, 4.5 and 8.5 mm) by combing synchronous co-rotation and counter rotation of the metalens doublet and linear translation of metalens #2. For each plane, the focus of the metalens doublet is steered along the lines of x,-axis, diagonal, and y,,-axis. Again, although focusing scanning on only three lateral planes are shown in FIG. 14(e) for sim- plicity, the metalens doublet can steer its focus at any position in the cylindrical 3D space with a diameter of ~27 mm and length of 8 mm\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\nFabrication and Experimental Verification\n\n[0061]\n\nBased on the above design a prototype of the 3D", "type": "Document"}}
