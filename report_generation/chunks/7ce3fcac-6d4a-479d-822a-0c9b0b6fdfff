The first processor electrically connects the audio source and the signal output. The audio source generates a first audio signal, and the first processor extracts a FO component from the first audio signal. The first processor processes the first audio signal with DoME based ona hearing profile and output a second audio signal, and the enhancement weight of the FO component in the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile. The signal output stimulates a cochlear of a user with the second audio signal.\n\nSurgical and clinical factors can further limit the effec- tiveness of the CI in a manner that can vary from patient to patient. These include the depth at which the electrode is placed into the cochlea, possible trauma to the cochlea or auditory nerve before or during the procedure, and other physiological or pathological differences between patients. Auditory nerve stimulation is also limited by the number of electrodes on a given array. In normal hearing (NH) indi- viduals, the auditory nerve is stimulated by thousands of hair cells; in contrast, the most advanced arrays available today can only provide up to 24 electrodes within each cochlea. Furthermore, electrical \u201ccrosstalk\u201d between adjacent elec- trodes on the array limits the number of independent elec- trode channels that can be achieved.\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65", "type": "Document"}}
