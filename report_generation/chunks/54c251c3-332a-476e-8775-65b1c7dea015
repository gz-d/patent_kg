For each participant, the trials in the preference decision making task were split into two sets: one for the trials in which the left-side image was chosen to be preferred, and the other for the trials in which the right-side image was chosen. Similar to the preference decision making task, face images used in a trial were matched in gender and attractiveness ratings. Thus, the two sides were expected to be chosen equally often. For each set, all but one trial was used to train a left-selected and a right-selected SHMM and the held-out trial was used for testing. For testing, an aggregated SHMM was created from the two trained SHMMs, which could be used to infer the participant\u2019s choice. In particular, the aggregated SHMM contained 3 high-level states: exploration, left-selected preference-biased, and right- selected preference-biased periods. In the high-level transition matrix of this aggregated SHMM., the transition probability of moving from the exploration period to a preference- biased period was equally divided between the left-selected and right-selected preference-\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n30\n\nbiased periods. Finally, to perform inference of the participant\u2019s choice on the test eye fixation sequence, the posterior probability of high-level state of the last fixation D(S7p|xX1,...,Xr) given the test sequence (%,,...Xx7) was computed, which indicates the probability of being in either the left-selected or right-selected preference-biased period at the end of the trial. The left/right-selected preference-biased period with higher probability was predicted as the choice. This was repeated over all trials for each participant to calculate the inference accuracy.\n\nThe inferences were performed in three ways. First, to examine the percentage of", "type": "Document"}}
