More particularly, the pres- ent invention is concerned with a method for post-process- ing an electrospinning spinning film to enhance the mechanical properties.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Waterproof and moisture-permeable membrane materials are widely used in the fields of waterproof and moisture-permeable clothing, architectural fabric mem- branes and smart wearables. These materials have a good market prospect and increasing demand. The current water- proof and moisture-permeable membrane materials in a form of fabrics on the market are represented, for example, by expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and its homologous microporous films.\n\n[0003] Commonly used waterproof and moisture-perme- able membrane materials are expanded polyethylene film and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). PTFE by the company Gore-Tex is a porous film prepared by thermal stretching technology. Said film involves many layouts and thus the processing is complex and expensive, such high technology barriers hinder these materials being popularly used.", "type": "Document"}}
