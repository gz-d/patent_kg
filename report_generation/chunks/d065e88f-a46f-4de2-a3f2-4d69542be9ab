The method of altering the genome of the cell may include, for example, contacting the cell with, or expressing in the cell, the modified SaCas9 protein as described above, and a gRNA having a region complementary to a selected portion of the genome of the cell with optimal nucleotide spacing at the genomic target site.\n\nIn one embodiment, the modified protein includes amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 1 or homologue thereof wherein the modified protein comprising amino acid sequence includes a mutation at an N413 position.\n\nIna further embodiment, the modified protein including a mutation at an N413 position further includes one or more mutations at the R245, N419 or R654 positions. In a particular embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 3 or a homologue thereof that includes a mutation at N413, N419, R245 and R654 positions. In a preferred embodiment, the mutation is a single amino acid substitution. In a most preferred embodiment, the modified protein includes an alanine at the N413 position, and/or optionally at the N419, R245 and R654\n\nExample 1\n\nStructure-Guided Protein Engineering for High-Fidelity SaCas9", "type": "Document"}}
