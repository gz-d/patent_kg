PTFE is a promising electret material with high negative charge storage capability and robust stability. Such superior performances can be preserved through continuous droplet impinging (left) or ion-injection (right). The charge loaded by droplet impinging is from the contact electrification between the PTFE and water. Moreover, the negative charges on the PFFE film can be also be enhanced by the ion- injection, which is conducted by utilizing a commercial antistatic gun (Zerostat3, Milty) to inject various ions including CO NO NO O3,, and O> from a vertical distance of ~5 cm\u201d.", "type": "Document"}}
