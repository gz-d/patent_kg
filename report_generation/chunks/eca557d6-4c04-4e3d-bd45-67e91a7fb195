The S-parameters of the prototype were measured with an Agilent vector network analyzer E5071C. The simulated and measured results can be found in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 3, the measure reflection coefficient for the TE Port (IS,,1) is 8.1% (2.36- 2.56 GHz), agreeing reasonably with the simulated 9.8% (2.34-2.58 GHz). For the TM Port, t coefficient is 18.0% (2.28-2.73 GHz) counterpart is 20.08% (2.20-2.71 GHz). Besides, the mea- sured and simulated |S,,| is below -2 3.0 GHz, which is suitable for practical applications. e measured reflection whereas its simulate: 0 dB from 2.0 GHz to", "type": "Document"}}
