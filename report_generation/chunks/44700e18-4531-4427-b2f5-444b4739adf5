Heating device 16 may be any convenient heating device such as, for example, a high frequency heating device. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 the heating device 16 surrounds the evaporation chamber 17, but alternatively the heating device 16 may be located simply at the bottom of the evaporation chamber 17. The vaporized sulfur is then allowed to escape from the evaporation chamber 17 through the neck 23 of the evapora- tion chamber which neck 23 has a diameter that is relatively small compared to the size of the evaporation chamber 17 so that the sulfur vapor may be in a quasi-equilibrium state within the evaporation chamber 17. Generally, the ratio of the entrance area of the neck 23 to the top area of the evaporation chamber 17 should be more than 4.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: \u2014\n\nFIG. 1 is a sectional view through a FEFE-PBII apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention,\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates the electric field lines in the implantation chamber in the embodiment of FIG. 1,\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates the changing potential between the sample holder and the opening of the inlet conduit,\n\nFIG. 4 shows as an example the depth of implantation of sulfur atoms using the apparatus of the embodiment of FIG. 1.", "type": "Document"}}
