The controller may be the controller mentioned with reference to the first aspect and/or the controller mentioned with reference to the third aspect.\n\n[0041] The controller may include, e.g. one or more: CPU(s), MCU(s), GPU(s), logic circuit(s), Raspberry Pi chip(s), digital signal processor(s) (DSP), application-spe- cific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC), field-programmable gate array(s) (FPGA), and/or digital or analog circuitry/circuit- ties configured to interpret and/or to execute program instructions and/or to process signals and/or information and/or data. In some embodiments, the controller comprises one or more field-programmable gate arrays.\n\n[0042] In some embodiments, the controller is operable provide control signals to the subwavelength units, in par- ticular their control arrangements/control elements, to affect operation of the subwavelength units.\n\n[0043] In some embodiments, the controller is arranged (e.g., programmed) to provide a set of control signals to the plurality of subwavelength units of the metasurface antenna to spatiotemporally affect operation of the plurality of sub- wavelength units of the metasurface antenna, so as to facilitate manipulation or control of amplitude, phase, polar- ization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. The set of control signals may providing multiple time-coding sequences that can enable or facilitate beam steering, focusing, data communication, etc.", "type": "Document"}}
