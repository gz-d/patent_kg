Si (113) single crystal was used as monochromator for an X-ray beam at 105.7 keV. In a typical in situ collection, the coin cells (NCM811 cathode with Al current collector) were operated with a constant current of Yio C. A single XRD pattern was obtained during a time period of 300 s. The two-dimensional (2D) diffraction patterns were collected in the transmission geometry with a Perkin-Elmer detector. The sample-to detector distance, detector tilt angles and the instrumental resolution function were calibrated with a standard sample of CeO,. The inte- gration and calibration of the 2D patterns were performed with the Fit2D software, and the lattice parameters were extracted from the integrated XRD patterns using Fullprof software. For the Rietveld refinements, the backgrounds were subtracted by linear interpolation and the peak shapes were described using a pseudo-Voigt profile function.\n\nCollection and Analysis of Soft and Hard XAS\n\n[0037] The soft XAS spectra of Ni La-edge were collected in both TEY and PFY modes with the high-resolution spherical-grating monochromator (SGM) beamline at the Canadian Light Source (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan). The TEY signal was recorded as the specimen current, while PFY signal was measured by detecting the X-ray fluores- cence photons emitted from the element of interest using Si drift detectors. Each powder sample (ca. 0.2 mg) was spread in a thin layer on a 3 mmx3 mm carbon conductive adhesive tape (Agar Scientific) and then pressed into the substrate. The carbon tape was attached to the sample holder at a 45\u00b0 angle facing toward the photon beam. The hard XAS spectra of Ni K-edge (8333 eV) were collected on 20-BM-B beam-\n\nD~\n\nApr. 14, 2022", "type": "Document"}}
