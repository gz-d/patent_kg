X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which has a superficial penetration of 1-5 nm, was initially carried out to determine the surface chemistry (FIG. 4a). In the typical core-level spectra of Ni 2p, the spin-orbit doublets at 854.4 eV (2p,,.) and 872.3 eV (2p,,.) are assigned to the Ni?* state, while Ni** can be distinguished by the splitting holes of 2p,,. and 2p,,. at 855.5 eV and 873.3 eV, respec- tively. For the PGE-NCMB811, the binding energies of the Ni-2p spin-orbit doublets rigidly shifted to a higher value, accompanied with slight broadening of the Co-2p and Mn-2p XPS peaks (FIGS. 5a-4). Consequently, the KMnO, oxidizing dominantly ascends the average valance of Ni in the surface NiO,-octahedral layers. The relative content of Ni** and Ni2+ could be provided by a semi-quantitative analysis of the integrated peak area, where the Ni>* content is estimated to be about 13.5% higher in the PGE-NCM811\n\nouter layers. [0044] The Ni L,-edge soft XAS signals (FIG. 44), which\n\ncorrespond to the unoccupied Ni-3d states through 2p-3d excitations, were collected in the total electron yield (TEY) mode to further probe the chemical environment within a sensitive depth of about 20 nm. The intensity ratio of the double-peak characters fingerprints the oxidation states of Ni** at 854.1 eV and Ni** at 855.9 eV. We find that the Ni** intensity of PGE-NCM811 material is stronger than that of pristine one in the soft XAS spectra, indicating a larger content of Ni** existing in the grain surface area compared to the pristine alternative. In contrast, the partial fluores- cence yield (PFY) spectra, which probe the bulk to a depth of than 200 exhibit subtle difference between the\n\nmore\n\nnm,\n\nApr. 14, 2022", "type": "Document"}}
