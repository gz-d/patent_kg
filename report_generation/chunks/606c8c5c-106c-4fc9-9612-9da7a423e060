For example, as illustrated in FIG. 6B, the core tip of electro- magnetic device 601 is in an actuated state and closer to the center of the workspace 60, while the core tip of electro- magnetic device 602 is in an unactuated state and further away from the center of the workspace 60. FIG. 6C shows a motor 650 that is coupled to the magnetic core 6020 of one electromagnetic device via a lead screw shaft 652.\n\n[0072] FIG. 7 illustrates an electromagnetic actuation sys- tem 700 according to certain embodiments of the present invention. For clarity, the casing and some components, such as electrical wires, power supply, are not shown. The system 700 includes eight electromagnetic devices 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, 707, and 708. Each electromagnetic device, for example, can be a specific implementation of one or more electromagnetic devices as stated above with reference to one or more figures.\n\nof the electromagnetic devices are made of DT4E material, which exhibits good electromagnetic properties, low coer- civity, high-saturation magnetic induction, and absence of magnetic aging problem. The turn number of each electric coil is 1400. The electric coil is implemented as copper wire. The diameter of the enameled copper wire for windings is 3 mum and each electrical coil has a total resistance of 1.77Q. The operating current of the system is derived from eight programmable power supplies with 1600 W power rating for each, which can provide a stable maximum current of 20 A for each electric coil.\n\n[0079] In the present embodiment, only a single electro- magnetic device is energized. Optimized values for geomet- tic parameters for its magnetic core are identified to maxi- mize the magnetic performance including magnetic flux density and gradient performance.", "type": "Document"}}
