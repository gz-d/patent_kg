The loading condition of each winding will be detected. Dur- ing this scanning mode, MCUs is not activated at all. The transferred power is only consumed by a large resistor R,,,, and is much smaller than the typical charging power absorbed. by a battery. Such transferred power is then detected by R,.,, at the transmitter side. When the detected power is higher than the low threshold value and below the over-power limits, the load is identified as a possible load. The position of the load can also be known by searching fora local maximum amongst different transmitter windings. When no load or an invalid load is detected, the system will loop back and repeat the system scan. The use of very low power in this scanning process is also for safety reasons and prevents the inverter circuit from facing a short-circuit or near-short-circuit situa- tion, particularly when the load is a piece of metal or cigarette\n\nwherein the relative dimensions of the primary windings and the secondary winding are chosen to meet the con- ditions that (a) the area enclosed by the secondary wind- ing is greater than the area enclosed by a primary wind- ing, (b) the secondary winding or said shielding will always fully enclose a primary winding when a second- ary winding is placed on said charging surface, and (c)a single primary winding generates sufficient power to charge a said battery.\n\n2. planar battery charging system as claimed in claim wherein the ratio of the area enclosed by the secondary winding to the area enclosed by a primary winding is mini- while being consistent with conditions (a) and (b).\n\n[he planar battery charging system as claimed in claim erein said primary windings are arranged in a regular of identical size and shape.", "type": "Document"}}
