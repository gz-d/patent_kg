This is because the 2D data represen- tation of the signal in the frequency domain allows the usage of deep neural networks for hidden feature extraction. The results also show that in general, using the T+C data leads to a better performance than using T or C only. This suggests the importance of both the channel-wise gradient feature set and the temporal gradient feature sets for known microges- ture classification on the interactive wearable device 100.\n\nSecondly, a classification ML model CM is trained with at least one negative training data sets in response to the negative event, and is trained with at least one of positive training data sets in response to the positive event. The steps of training method to train the ML model ML2 are fully described as follows.\n\nFIG. 11 depicts a step flow chart of a training method for training the classification ML model CM according to an embodiment of the present invention.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nincluding the positive feature vectors is obtained.

In some embodi- ments, the classification ML model CM is a binary SVM classifier. In addition, in some embodiments, in the step S20, a grid-searching mechanism is performed, by the processor P, to find the optimal set of hyper-parameters (RBF kernal, C =1000, =0.1) for the SVM classifier.\n\ng", "type": "Document"}}
