Zebrafish eggs are collected and placed in egg medium (19.3 mM NaCl, 0.23 mM KCl, 0.13 mM MgSO,-7H,0, 0.2 mM Ca(NO,),, .67 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) at 28.5\u00b0 C. for 4 hours before sorting for viability. Healthy embryos are then incubated at 28.5\u00b0 C. up to 48 hpf Six ul of stock solution was added to 6-ml egg medium containing 20 healthy 48-hpf embryos. The final concentration of haloperidol is 2 uM and the final concentration of DMSO was 0.1% at which no effect was observed in zebrafish. After 4 hour of incubation, blood circulation of zebrafish is examined and videoed under stereomicroscope equipped with CCD camera comnected to digital video camera via S-video cable. Video is stored in mini DV tape and transferred back to personal computer via the connection of i-Link between digital video camera and computer. Video clip is stored in personal computer in the format of AVI. Image analysis and data analysis is per- formed by our home-made software implemented algo-\n\nwherein the cardiac rhythmicity index is inversely correlated with the regularity of heart beat rhythm.\n\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein said embryo or larva is from zebrafish or medaka.\n\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein the embryo or larva comprises fertilized eggs of at least 48 hours post fertiliza-\n\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein said embryo or larva in step (a) is incubated for at least 4 hours.\n\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein step (b) comprises immobilization of teleost embryos or larvae in immobiliza- medium, such as agarose, agar or methyl-cellulose.\n\n6. The method of claim 1, wherein step (c) comprises recording of circulation of blood cells at any part or larvae body for at least 20 seconds.\n\n7.
