In an exemplary embodiment, the sup- port member can be provided to extend along at least a portion of the spine. For example, the support member can have such a length to span across the deformed spine portion and bridge the intact vertebrae. Additionally or alternatively, the support member can be placed in the posterior or anterior aspect of the spine in its parent phase (or austenite phase). In an exemplary embodiment, the support member can be provided to extend along the posterior side of the spine. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member can be provided to extend along the anterior side of the spine. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of positioning the support member are also within the scope of the present invention.\n\nThe support member can be mounted onto the spine in various manners. For example, the support member can be secured onto the spine by various securing elements, such as one or more bone fasteners. Examples of bone fasteners include, but not limited to, hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the supporting rod can have its free ends mounted onto the spine using various bone fasteners. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of mounting the support member are also within the scope of the present invention.\n\nThe anchor members can be locked onto the support mem- ber and the deformed spine portion in various manners. For example, the locking process can be carried out by tightening the anchor members. In an exemplary embodiment, the lock- ing process can be carried out by using a surgical tool, such as a screw driver, via incision.
