As a further example, a first portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.) can be reflected at the communications antenna by a first portion of the communications antenna, such as, e.g., by a non-planar reflective ground plane of the communications antenna (e.g., V-shaped concave ground plane 304, U-shaped concave ground plane 504, and the like, etc.). In yet another example, methodologies 1900 can include reflecting a second portion of the incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.) at the communications antenna by a second portion of the communications antenna, such as, e.g., by one or more antenna elements (e.g., reflective suspended plate antenna (SPA) 102 element) of the communications antenna (e.g. GA", "type": "Document"}}
