In certain embodiments, the wirelessly-controlled. electrostimulation module can be activated by a radio fre- quency to exert electrostimulation on a target site, e.g., skin or tissues of certain internal organ or body systems. In certain embodiments, the IBMN device can be operated in the absence of a battery. It can be either externally controlled and programmable to output a target waveform based on certain wireless communication protocols such as Near-field communication (NFC). When the IBMN device is activated, the drug can be delivered to the target site through the microneedles under the electrostimulation, and can be fur- ther delivered to the target site or its surroundings upon gradual biodegradation or through bioresorption of the IBMN device. Depending on the purpose or application of the present device, the microprotrusion (tip section) of microneedles of the present device can be penetrated into the skin or tissues more deeply for deeper tissue repairment. Since the microneedles will eventually be fully degraded into biological benign end products, absorbed and metabo- lized by the recipient\u2019s body, the materials used to form at least the microneedle-based drug delivery module should be safe and biocompatible, such that no adverse side effects or immune-responses will be triggered by these materials in the recipient\u2019s body. By implanting such an IBMN device into the recipient\u2019s body, it eliminates the need for a secondary surgical operation to remove any implanted devices from the recipient after treatment. Bio-integration of certain biocom- patible materials into the target tissue may also facilitate the regeneration of the damaged tissue, in addition to the", "type": "Document"}}
