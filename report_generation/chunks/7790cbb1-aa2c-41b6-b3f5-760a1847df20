The electronic memory device in accordance with laim 5, wherein the plurality of flip-flops are connected etween two stages of the pipelining memory structure.\n\n7. The electronic memory device in accordance claim 6, wherein the two stages including a first stage of plurality of basic memory blocks and a second stage of AND operation logic gate.\n\n8. The electronic memory device in accordance with claim 7, further comprising a priority encoder arranged convert an output from the second stage to an address of data stored in the electronic device.\n\n[0079] In this operation, the input search key (Sk) is divided into n 6-bit sub-words (Sw) and are provided to its corresponding n D-CAM blocks. Sw is searched in m D-CAM blocks in parallel to generate 64-bit matchline vectors (ML_Vs). The m ML_Vs from each of the n D-CAM blocks are ANDed to form m*64 matchlines (MLs) which are converted to an address by the priority encoder (PE).\n\n9. The electronic memory device in accordance claim 8, wherein the address is a matching address obtained. response to a searching operation.\n\n10. The electronic memory device in accordance with claim 4, wherein the memory element has a distributed random-access memory (RAM) structure.\n\n[0080] The inventors also evaluated the performance of the memory device in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In the experiment, the D-TCAM was implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA for the size 512x144. In the experiment, the FPGA device XC6VLX760 is used with -2 speed grade.\n\n11.
