For decades, these huge numbers of non-coding RNAs (ncR- NAs) have been considered as \u201cdark matter\u201d and their functions remained to be developed. These ncRNAs, espe- cially long non-coding ribonucleic acids (IncRNA, defined as ncRNAs with more than 200 nucleotides in length) have been of interest recently, which were generally considered to be an important part participating in epigenetic regulation. For example, various IncRNAs were involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation, the dysregulation of which is associated with progression and metastasis of various can- cers.\n\n[0004] XIST (X-inactivation specific transcript) is one of the first widely studied IncRNAs, which directs X chromo- some inactivation (XCI) in female mammals, thus balancing the dose of genes between XY males and XX females. Its ability to constrain chromatin binding proteins makes it possible to label allele and cis-regulate transcription. At present, XC] and XIST have become exemplary models for understanding the epigenetic regulation of IncRNA.", "type": "Document"}}
