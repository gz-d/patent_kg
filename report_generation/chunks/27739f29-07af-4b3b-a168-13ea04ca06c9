The remote computer(s) 1444 can be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network C, a workstation, a microprocessor based appliance, a peer device or other common network node and the like, and typically includes many or all of the elements described rela- tive to computer 1412. For purposes of brevity, only a memory storage device 1446 is illustrated with remote com- uter(s) 1444. Remote computer(s) 1444 is logically con- nected to computer 1412 through a network interface 1448 and then physically connected via communication connec- tion 1450. Network interface 1448 encompasses wire and/or wireless communication networks such as local-area net- works (LAN) and wide-area networks (WAN). LAN tech- nologies include Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Copper Distributed Data Interface (CDDI), Ethernet, Token Ring and the like. WAN technologies include, but are not limited to, point-to-point links, circuit switching networks like Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) and varia- tions thereon, switching networks, and Digital Sub-\n\nvolatile/nonvolatile computer storage media. FIG. 14 illus- trates, for example, a disk storage 1424. Disk storage 1424 includes, but is not limited to, devices like a magnetic disk drive, floppy disk drive, tape drive, Jaz drive, Zip drive, LS-100 drive, flash memory card, or memory stick. In addi- tion, disk storage 1424 can or in combination with ot limited to, an optical disk device (CD-ROM), CD ri rewritable drive (CD-RW ROM drive (DVD-ROM). storage devices 1424 to t include storage media separately er storage media including, but not drive such as a compact disk ROM ecordable drive (CD-R Drive), CD Drive) or a digital versatile disk [o facilitate connection of the disk e system bus 1418, a removable or non-removable interface is typically used, such as interface", "type": "Document"}}
