This element is a component of the element 116 in FIG. 1. The processed structured data 307 is from the structured data pre-processing process 300, and the processed textual data 506 is from the textual data pre-processing process 500. Element 801 is a combination filter, which can screen out the samples that have only either structured data or image data. The data passing through the filter 801 are divided into structured data training set 802 and image data training set 803, respectively. The training sets 802 and 803 are mixed into concatenating data and become the input of the 3DCNN and ViT training 805. A plurality of backbones is used and compared in the 3DCNN, including Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), EfficientNets, Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENets or SEResNets). We first input the image data into the models and then concatenate the embeddings from the last fully connected layers with clinical data. The prediction outputs of the 3DCNN and ViT are ensembled 806. The LVO classifier is tested using the testing dataset. To improve performance and reduce generalization errors of the LVO classifier, test-time\n\n15\n\naugmentation (TTA) and prediction averaging are added during the inference 807.\n\n20\n\n25", "type": "Document"}}
