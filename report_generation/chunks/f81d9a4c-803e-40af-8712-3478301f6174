FPGAs, having considerable amount of memory and logical resources, are extremely favorable for complex reconfigurable systems, e.g., software defined net- works (SDNs). The presence of TCAM in FPGAs may be preferable for implementing such complex systems.\n\n[0043] In this example, FFs in FPGA terminology are known as slice registers (SRs). Gate-based TCAMs reduces the hardware resources in terms of slices per TCAM bit but may lack scalability because of its high routing complexity. LH-CAM and G-AETCAM may be two examples imple- mented as 64x36 BiCAM and TCAM, respectively, on Xilinx FPGA. It may be preferable in terms of hardware resources and speed for small size TCAM, but for larger sizes, it may not be a good option to emulate TCAM on FPGA.\n\n[0035] With reference to FIG. 1, a routing table may be maintained in the TCAM which stores the destination addresses and the ports to which the data packet needs to be forwarded. The router compares the destination address (e.g. \u201c0 1 0 1\u201d) of the incoming packet with the stored addresses and chooses the appropriate port (Port A). The matchline of TCAM may act as a pointer to the corresponding word (Port number) in static random-access memory (SRAM).\n\n[0044] In one example embodiment, there is provided an electronic memory device comprising: a plurality of basic memory blocks connected together with a modular structure, wherein each of the basic memory blocks includes a plu- rality lookup tables (LUT) arranged to operate as an memory element for storing a plurality of bits of logic levels; and a plurality of registers each pairing up with a respective", "type": "Document"}}
