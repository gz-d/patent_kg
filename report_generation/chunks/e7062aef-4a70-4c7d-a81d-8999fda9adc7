The method 400 comprises three main steps. The method may commence at step 401 where a porous layer 202 is deposited with a layer of active material 204. In this example, the porous layer is a track-etched polycarbonate (PC) mem- brane. The membrane may have a thickness of about 7 um and pore size of about 50 nm. The nanoporous PC membrane may be deposited with a gold nano-layer 204 of about 10 mm. The deposition process may be performed by reported methods such as spin coating, dip coating, vapour deposition and the like.\n\n[0074] On the top of the chamber 602, there are provided with two pairs of pores that are symmetrically arranged with respect to the virtual axis 603. With reference to FIG. 6B, the pores 604A and 604B arranged close to each end of the chamber are inlets for directing solutions into the chamber for operation; whereas the pores (604C, 604D) close to the virtual axis 603 are where the electrodes placed for opera- tion. Preferably, the pores 604C and 604D are spaced apart from each other by 20 mm.\n\n[0075] Turning to the inside of the chamber, there is provided a compartment 606 for retaining solutions. In this example, the compartment has a diameter of 7 mm (FIG. 6A). The compartment 606 is separated by a chemically modified PC membrane 608, with a diameter of 22 mm, into two individual compartments 606A and 606B. Each of the individual compartments is connected to respective inlets for retaining the solution directed therefrom. In this example, the compartment 606A is fluidly connected to inlet 604A whereas the compartment 606B is fluidly connected to inlet 604B.", "type": "Document"}}
