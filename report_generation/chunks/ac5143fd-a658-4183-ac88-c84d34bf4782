As referred to herein, such solar\n\noutput Voltage of a Solar power generating system. According\n\nenergy collection antennas can be called green antennas, in\n\nto an aspect, SPA 100 can be optimized at a frequency of\n\nthat, according to aspects, the disclosed embodiments can\n\ninterest (e.g., 2 Gigahertz (GHz)). In addition, according to\n\nfunction as a communications antenna while generating\n\npower from Solar energy.\n\nan aspect, SPA 100 can be fabricated with approximate\n\n25\n\nFor instance, exemplary non-limiting implementations can\n\ndimensions of L (110)=100 millimeters (mm), W (112)=54\n\nemploy suspended plate antenna (SPA) arrays fabricated or\n\nmm, h (114)=18 mm, t (116)=1.5 mm, L.
