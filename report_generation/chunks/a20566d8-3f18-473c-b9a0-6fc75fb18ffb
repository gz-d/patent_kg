However, it worked in a completely different way. Instead of relying on the tensile elongation of the web mem- ber 53 to provide compression shortening of the mechanism 50d, it relied on the compressive plastic buckling of the two chord plates 25 to provide the plastic shortening of the mecha- nism 50d. The tensile yielding of the web was prevented by using a 10mm thick mild steel plate 28 as the web member 53. The load vs. displacement response of this mechanism 506, with a steel plate 28 having a width of 70 mm, was obtained by compression test in a universal compression machine. An approximately elasto-plastic response was obtained which is shown in FIG. 4.", "type": "Document"}}
