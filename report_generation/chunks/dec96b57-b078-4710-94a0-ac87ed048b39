For many existing systems, the magnetic field is unsatisfactory to manipulate the actuation subject. The magnetic field may be not strong enough, thereby reducing the driving capability. The formed workspace is small or cannot be adjusted. The driving capacity depends additionally on specific configuration of the actuation subject. All these limit industrial applications of magnetic-based manipulation of actuation subject.\n\nan\n\nto\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n[0035] Example embodiments solve one or more of these problems and provide technical solutions where improved performance in one or more aspects is achieved, such as improved driving capability, flexibility, and/or expanded. industrial applications.\n\n[0036] One or more embodiments recognize the impor- tance of magnetic field gradient in driving actuation subject. An increased gradient improves driving capacity and effec- tiveness. Larger gradient means the actuation subject is subject to greater driving force and can migrate more quickly in the workspace. For a swarm of microagents, for example, a larger gradient contributes to compact aggrega- tion in a target area. The enhanced gradient shortens the time of migration. This may be of particular significance in some applications, such as clinical context, where time may matter significantly.", "type": "Document"}}
