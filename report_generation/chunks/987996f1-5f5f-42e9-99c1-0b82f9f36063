The computer may be implemented by any com- puting architecture, including stand-alone PC, client/server architecture, \u201cdumb\u201d terminal/mainframe architecture, or any other appropriate architecture. The computing device is appropriately programmed to implement the invention. The computer may comprise suitable components necessary to receive, store and execute appropriate computer instruc- tions.\n\n[0190] The color coding system may be readily used in the different applications, such as (but not limited to), fashion and apparel design, painting, printing, dying, product and interior design.\n\n[0191] In an alternative embodiment of the present inven- tion, features in the abovementioned embodiments may be provided in a color processing system comprising a pro- cessing module arranged to process information associated with a color code, wherein the color code includes at least one numerical codes mapped by the color mapper of the color coding system as discussed earlier in this disclosure. The system may also be used to process color information according to any of the abovementioned methods so as to map, render, convert and/or manipulate the color informa- tion according to the previous embodiments.\n\n[0197] It will also be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.", "type": "Document"}}
