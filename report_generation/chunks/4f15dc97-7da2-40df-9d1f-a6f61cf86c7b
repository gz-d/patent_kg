The de link voltage is provided by a boost converter in this example. The matrix power switching circuit comprises a power inverter consist- ing of four high-frequency power switches 10 that in FIG. 8 are implemented by power mosfets driven by gate drivers 11 and that are switched to provide high-frequency excitation for the selected transmitter windings. The winding selection is made by closing the appropriate row-switches $1, $2, 83 and column-switches S4, S5, S6. S1 to S6 are bi-directional switches that do not need high-frequency switching. If cho- sen, they will be turned on during the charging period. For example, if the transmitter winding in the middle of the zone is selected, row-switch S2 and column-switch S5 will be turned on during the charging period. Similarly, the top right-\n\nIn this example the relationship between D and d is:\n\nD=2d\n\n(4)\n\nThe area ratio between one receiver and transmitter winding is:\n\nAreceiver Arransmitter\n\nThe area ratio is an important factor in the optimal trans- mitter and receiver winding coverage theory. This ratio should be minimized subject to the conditions that the receiver winding is larger than a transmitter winding (i.e., the ratio can never be 1 or less) and that wherever the receiver winding is placed on the charging surface at least one trans- mitter winding is always fully covered. From equations (3) and (5), it is clear that winding arrangement in FIG. 6 is preferable to that in FIG. 5 because it has a lower area ratio.", "type": "Document"}}
