In some examples, the transmission line arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a transmis- sion line. In some examples, the transmission line is straight. In some examples, the first capacitive arrangement com- prises, or consists only of, a capacitor. In some examples, the second capacitive arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a capacitor. In some examples, the first odd-mode- shorted coupler is electrically connected between the source terminal of the second transistor of the first oscillator of the first radiator unit and the source terminal of the first tran-\n\nsistor of the first oscillator of the second radiator unit.\n\nodd-mode-\n\nsecond\n\nthe\n\nembodiments,\n\nIn\n\n[0044]\n\nsome", "type": "Document"}}
