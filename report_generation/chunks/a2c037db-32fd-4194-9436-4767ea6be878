The variance ratios and significance results are listed in column as \u2018R, /sig.\u2019 in FIG, 15, where Riy is the variance ratio and sig. is the significance result. The symbol \u20181\u2019, \u2018-1\u2019, or \u20180\u2019 denote the proposed method is \u2018significantly superior\u2019, \u2018significantly inferior\u2019, or \u2018insignificant\u2019 to the benchmark method in the row, respectively. It can be observed that on C,U,, the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodiment is signifi- cantly superior to all benchmark schemes except for Liu\u2019s scheme. On C,C, subset, except for Liu, MSSSIM, and IW-SSIM, the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodi- ment is significantly superior to all other methods. Liu, MSSSIM, and IW-SSIM may be comparable in evaluating the synthesized videos whose distortions are coming from color videos. In addition, the SR-23DVQA method of the present embodiment has significantly superior performance than all the other methods on the ALL dataset and subset U,Cp. It is because the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodiment is mainly proposed to evaluate the flicker distortion in synthesized video caused by the depth map and. it works very well. Overall, the significance test has further validates the superiority of the SR-3DVQA method of the present embodiment in predicting the quality of the synthe-", "type": "Document"}}
