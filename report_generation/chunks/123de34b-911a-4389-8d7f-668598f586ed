CI bypasses the normal ear structure from the external auditory canal, tympanic mem- brane, middle ear, to the cochlear, and replaces it with electric current that directly stimulating the cochlear nerve so that audio signals are directly transmitted to the auditory athways.\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nThe present invention seeks to enable Cl users to person- alize musical features of an audio (music) source so that users can better enjoy the music.\n\nAccording to one aspect of the present invention, a system and method are provided for producing a typically func- tional hearing experience in a hearing-impaired individual. Specifically, in an embodiment of the present invention, the method for processing audio signals includes extracting a fundamental frequency (FO) component from a first audio signal; processing the first audio signal with Dominant Melody Enhancement (DoME) based on a hearing profile and output a second audio signal; and providing the second audio signal to the user. The DoME enhances the FO component. The enhancement weight of the DoME is cor- responding to the hearing profile.\n\nDespite serving as powerful tools to restore functional hearing, modern CIs face significant hurdles in accurately representing complex acoustic signals. In particular, defi- ciencies in the representation of rich harmonic sounds and requency contours prevent Cls from accurately processing elements of acoustic signals which are important for our perception of musical sounds. These deficiencies result from limitations in the two main components of a CI system: the electrode array that is implanted into the cochlea to stimulate the cochlear (auditory) nerve; and the external sound-pro- cessing unit that converts acoustic sounds into electrical signals.\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50", "type": "Document"}}
