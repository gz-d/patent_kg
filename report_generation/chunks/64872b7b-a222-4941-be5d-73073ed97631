The PIN diode was modeled as a series of resistance R=8Q and inductance L=30 pH for forward biased (State \u201c0\u201d), and a series of capacitance C=0.052 pF and inductance L=30 pH for non-bias (State \u201c1\u201d), respec- tively. Wave ports are adopted to excite the fundamental TE, mode of the substrate integrated waveguide.\n\n[0196] As an example, the universal metasurface antenna is fabricated by using commercial multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) technology.

The total 164 PIN diodes are then mounted on the gaps of the slot openings through reflow soldering. The radiation pattern of the universal metasurface antenna is measured in a microwave anechoic chamber using a recon- figurable robotic measurement system (FIGS. 48A and 48B). In one example, a signal generator (Agilent E8267D) launches monochromatic waves at 23.5 GHz to feed the universal metasurface antenna; a horn antenna is connected to a vector network analyzer (VNA, Keysight N9041B) to detect the radiated EM waves from the metasurface. The robotic arm holds the linearly polarized horn antenna, which can rotate along a user-defined circular path from \u201490\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 to measure the radiation pattern of the universal meta- surface antenna 400. Different polarization components of the EM waves can be measured by physically rotating the\n\nlinearly polarized horn antenna.\n\n[0197]\n\nAn indoor wireless communication experiment is", "type": "Document"}}
