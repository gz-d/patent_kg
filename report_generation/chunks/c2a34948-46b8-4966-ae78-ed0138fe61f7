Then the far-field radiation pattern of Metalens #1 can be obtained from the measured near-field data using fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and the result is plotted in FIG. 19(c). A good agreement between the measured and simulated radiation patterns can be observed. Then Metalens #2 is put in front of Metalens #1 to realize near-field focus scanning. In this device, the separation between the metalens pair is controlled by the 3D printed dielectric posts with different heights and the met- alens doublet is actuated manually for testing; however, electrical actuation using commercially available rotary motors is used for the final product to enable rapid scanning. For each near-field focusing case, the probe is put at the focal plane to record the radiating vertically polarized field component of the metalenses. FIGS. 15(e), 16(e) show the measured near-field power densities when S=0 5 mm and the metalens doublet is rotated to steer the focus radially (along Yg-axis) and azimuthally (with radius r-8.9 mm), respec- tively. The measured near-field power densities along the line x,=0 mm on the focal plane are shown in FIG. 15(6), and the measured results agree well with the simulated ones. The focus steering feasibility is evident from FIGS. 15(e), 16(e) where clear measured focus radially and azimuthally steering trajectories can be observed.", "type": "Document"}}
