The filter-antenna could be the one in Figures 2A to 2D. The method 300 includes, step 302, forming a microstrip antenna, and in step 304, integrating, in the microstrip antenna, absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. The two steps 302, 304 may be carried out the order stated, or simultaneously. The microstrip antenna may be a patch antenna. In one example, forming the microstrip antenna includes processing a PCB substrate (substrate + metallic layers on opposite faces of the substrate). Specifically forming the microstrip antenna may include forming a microstrip network on a first face of a substrate of the microstrip antenna, forming defected microstrip structure ln the microstrip network, and/or forming a defected ground structure on a ground plane on a second, opposite face of the microstrip antenna. The absorptive filter may be integrated in the substrate by forming (e.g., drilling) a hole in the substrate, then arranging the filter element in the hole. The filter element of the absorptive filter can be arranged substantially completely in the hole. Electric connections between the filter element and the ground plane may be formed by soldering or welding. Likewise, Electric connections between the\n\nin\n\nan\n\nin\n\na\n\nfilter element and the microstrip network may be formed by soldering or welding.\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n8\n\nFigures 4A and 4B show the prototype 400 of a filter-antenna fabricated based on the antenna 200 of Figures 2A to 2D.
