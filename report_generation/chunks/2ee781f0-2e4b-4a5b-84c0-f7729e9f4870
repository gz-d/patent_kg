The charging process of the modified system is shown in FIG. 6. The operation process is similar to that of the system shown ln FIG. 2; the difference is that the vaporized refrigerant generated from the solution channel 250 initially passes through membrane 246 to enter the vapor channel 242, and then passes through membrane 245 to enter the refrigerant channel 240, and finally gets condensed in the refrigerant channel 240.\n\n[0039] The cold discharging and heat discharging pro- cesses of the 5-channel reactor-based system 300 are respec- tively shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. The operation processes are substantially similar to those shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4; the difference is that the vaporized refrigerant evaporated from the refrigerant channel 240 initially passes through membrane 245 to enter the vapor channel 242, and then passes through membrane 246 to enter the solution channel 250, and finally gets absorbed in the solution channel 250.\n\n[0040] The microchannel membrane-based reactor is com- pared to other types of reactors, including plate heat exchanger reactors, horizontal falling-film reactors, and ver- tical falling-film reactors. FIG. 9 compares the absorption/ desorption rate, while FIG. 10 compares the coefficient of performance. These FIGS. demonstrate that the microchan- nel membrane-based thermochemical energy storage sys- tems of the present invention can outperform existing ther- mochemical energy storage systems while being more compact, more efficient, and having lower charging tem- perature.", "type": "Document"}}
