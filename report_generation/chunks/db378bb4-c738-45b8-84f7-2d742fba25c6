According to various embodiments, H 318 can be determined (e.g., experimentally or otherwise) by optimizing output of the one or more solar cell panel(s) 302. As described above, both single-element(s) 102 SPA and ground plane 304 can advantageously reflect incident light 322 to one or more appropriately positioned solar cell(s) 302 to increase output voltage of an associated solar generating system.\n\nIn further embodiments described herein, one or more solar cell(s) can be directly fabricated or otherwise placed on a surface of a dish (e.g., a substantially parabolic reflecting dish). Advantageously, such embodiments provide a space- efficient power generation capability as virtually no addi- tional space is required to house the solar generation capa- bilities.\n\nFIGS. 5-6 depict a further non-limiting implementation o a GA 500, comprising a light-focusing 3x3 SPA array ele- ment and a plurality of solar cell panels 502 suspended above a U-shaped ground plane 404 according to aspects as described herein, in which FIG. 5 depicts a side view 500, and FIG. 6 depicts a top view 600. According to an aspect, GA 500 can comprise a 3x3 array consisting of 9 SPA 102 radiating elements placed on a U-shaped concave ground plane 504.\n\nAccording to an aspect, implementations of the disclosed subject matter provide self-sustaining power to wireless sys- tems employing such implementations.
