The inventors devise that, although TCAM is vital element in networking applications, modem FPGAs may lack a hard core for TCAM because of its many other applications where TCAM would not be used. It was sup- ported by some old FPGAs in the form of partial memory blocks and multi-function blocks (MFBs), but TCAM is not included in other example FPGAs. In one example embodi- ment, a TCAM may be needed for the implementation of networking system inside an FPGA.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0024] Embodiments of the present invention will now described, by way of example, with reference to the accom- panying drawings in which:", "type": "Document"}}
