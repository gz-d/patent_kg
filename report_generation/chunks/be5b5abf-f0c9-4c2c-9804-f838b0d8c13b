A metasurface antenna system comprising:\n\nthe\n\nmetasurface antenna of claim 22, and\n\ncontroller operably coupled with the metasurface antenna to control operation of the metasurface antenna.\n\na\n\n30. The metasurface antenna system of claim 29, wherein the controller comprises one or more field-programmable gate arrays.\n\n31. The metasurface antenna system of claim 29, wherein the controller is arranged to provide control signals to the plurality of subwavelength units of the metasurface antenna to spatiotemporally affect or control operation of the plu- tality of subwavelength units of the metasurface antenna, so as to facilitate manipulation or control of amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromag- netic waves.", "type": "Document"}}
