In one example, the polymer chains of the first polymeric material and the third polymeric material may be functionalized with the first coupling agent 222 and the second coupling agent 224, respectively. In another example, each of the polymer chains of the first and the third polymeric materials may be functionalized with both the first coupling agent 222 and the second coupling agent 224. In this example, the polymer chains of the first polymeric material 218 may be function- alized with the first coupling agent 222 while the polymer chains of the third polymeric material 202 may be function- alized with the second coupling agent 224.\n\n[0167] The third crosslinking agent 216 may, on the one hand, partially act as an anchor for bonding the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material together so as to strengthen the robustness of the structure. For example, the third crosslinking agent 216 may form at least one ionic bond with a specific functional group of the polymer chains of the second polymeric material. As shown in FIG. 2C, the third crosslinking agent may form two hydrogen bonds with the guluronic acid units of the polymer chains of the third polymeric material 210. On the other hand, the ionic bond- ing may reversibly break down upon receiving external mechanical load/stress applied to the polymer matrix, thereby dissipating the applied mechanical loads. The bond- ing may also reform rapidly which in turn allowing the crosslinked structure to reestablish quickly thereby mini- mizing any structural expansion when the electrolyte is operated under water. That is, the third crosslinked structure comprises a plurality of polymer chains of the third poly- meric material ionically bonded together via the third cross-", "type": "Document"}}
