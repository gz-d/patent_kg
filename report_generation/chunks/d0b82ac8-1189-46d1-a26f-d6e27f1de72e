After the fabrication using two-photon absorption (TPA, FIG. 6A-6B), PDMS is cast into the master (FIG. 1E) to create a soft mold. PDMS was chosen because its curing dynamics can be easily controlled by adjusting the curing temperature and time (FIG. 1B and FIG. 5). The polymer- ization and curing are carefully controlled to induce the crack formation at locked regions in the soft mold during peeling from the closed-loop master. As demonstrated in the SEM images (FIG. 1C), the prepared PDMS in Phase I bears a large deformation and can be completely released from the closed-loop structure. In contrast, as shown in FIG. 6A, without the introduction of Phase I, the cracking was ran- domly formed in PDMS and both master and PDMS mold were damaged during the casting process. Moreover, the crack formed in Phase I can be spontaneously opened (FIG. 1D) in Phase IJ, making it possible to create many replicas based on one mold. On the other hand, without the intro- duction of Phase II the crack formed in Phase I is not stiff enough to self-seal; as shown in FIG. 6B, thin membranes are observed in the replica and blocks the hole of the loop during molding. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the principle of CECE is essential for the successful", "type": "Document"}}
