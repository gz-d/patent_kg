Most battery chargers for mobile phones provide a DC voltage of 4-6V. The functional block diagram 600 of a power adapter is shown in FIG. 6. When the power adaptor is plugged into the electronic equip- ment (to be charged), the two outputs DC+ 602 and DC- 604 are connected to the mechanical contacts of the charger socket of the electronic equipment.\n\nIn order to effectively pick up the perpendicular AC mag- netic flux generated by the planar inductive charging platform of FIG. 2, a planar winding 1100 with a certain number of turns (e.g., 12 turns) in the secondary module is wound. around a thin sheet of soft magnetic material (1102, 1104) as shown in FIGS. 11(a) and 11(4). The height of this winding is Jess than the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet. This thin or low-profile structure can be placed or glued, for example, on the active side of the battery inside the battery pack. The thin soft magnetic sheet serves as a magnetic core for the winding and guides the perpendicular AC magnetic flux (generated by the charging platform) through the winding. It should be noted that the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet can be very small (e.g., 0.5 mm) because the cross-sectional area for the magnetic flux to flow is the large flat surface of the soft sheet the flux lines flow", "type": "Document"}}
