The system 1500 includes one or more client(s) 1510. The client(s) 1510 can be hardware and/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The system 1500 also includes one or more server(s) 1530. Thus, system 1500 can correspond to a two-tier client server model or a multi-tier model (e.g., client, middle tier server, data server), amongst other models. The server(s) 1530 can also be hard- ware and/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The servers 1530 can house threads to perform transformations by employing the subject disclosure, for example. One possible communication between a client 1510 and a server 1530 may be in the form of a data packet trans-\n\nproven at times, principally reasons common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, ele- ments, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quan- tities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quan- tities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the foregoing discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the disclosed subject matter, discussions utilizing terms such as processing, computing, calculating, determining, and/or dis- playing, and the like, refer to the action and processes of computer systems, and/or similar consumer and/or industrial electronic devices and/or machines, that manipulate and/or transform data represented as physical (electrical and/or elec- tronic) quantities within the computer\u2019s and/or machine\u2019s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the machine and/or computer system memories or registers or other such information stor- transmission and/or devices.", "type": "Document"}}
