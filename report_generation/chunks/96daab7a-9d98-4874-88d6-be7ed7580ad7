The measured and simulated results are in reasonable agreement. As shown FIG. 6, the measured and simulated boresight antenna gains (9=07) are 10.07 dBi at 23.8 GHz and 11.18 dBi at 24.0 GHz, respec- tively. The measured antenna gain is 1.11 dB lower than the simulated antenna gain. This may be caused by the conduc- tive loss of the conductive strips used in fabricating the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna prototype 200.\n\n[0057] FIGS. 9A and 9B show the measured and simulated radiation patterns of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 at 2.45 GHz as well as the simulated results of the reference wid leband dielectric resonator antenna. As can be observed 9B, the measured and simulated results of the wideband from FIGS. 9A and dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are in reasonable agreement. In the boresig all of the cross-polar fields are weaker presence of the groove, the H-plane cros: ht direction (6=0\u00b0), than their co-polar counterparts by more than -25 dB. However, due to the s-polar fields of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna o the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are higher than those of the reference dielectric resonator antenna.\n\n[0053] In another embodiment, a wideband dual-fre- quency antenna, based on the antenna configuration of FIGS. 1A and 1C, integrating a wideband dielectric resona- tor antenna and wideband Fabry-Perot resonator antenna is investigated. In this embodiment, in the microwave part, the wide bandwidth is obtained by merging TE,,,* and TE,,;* modes of the dielectric resonator antenna. For the millime- ter-wave part, the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna mode and two L-probe modes are simultaneously excited and merged to enhance the bandwidth.", "type": "Document"}}
