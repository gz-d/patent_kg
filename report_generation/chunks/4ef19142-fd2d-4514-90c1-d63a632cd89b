Lipoylated PDH is responsible for converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, a central metabolite that enters into the TCA cycle. On the other hand, the delipoylation of PDH impairs its activity. Although the cellular localization of Sirt2 was conventionally annotated to be in the cytosol/ nucleus, recent literature has suggested that Sirt2 could localize to mitochondria and regulate the functions of mito- chondrial proteins. Sirt2 was detected in a mitochondrial fraction isolated from Hela S3 cells overexpressing Sirt2. It was investigated whether Sirt2 can delipoylate PDH and regulate its function in living cells. Sirt2 was overexpressed in HeLa S3 cells by transfecting cells with pCMV4a-Sirt2 vector. After transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. Western blot experiments confirmed effective Sirt2 overex- pression. The obtained cell lysates were then subjected to a PDH activity assay. As shown in FIG. 7, PDH activity in cells overexpressing Sirt2 was significantly decreased com- pared to that in wild-type cells. The lipoylation level of DLAT (E2 subunit of PDH) was decreased in cells overex- pressing Sirt2, whereas the total level of DLAT remained unchanged. Furthermore, siRNA knock-down experiments were performed to examine the regulatory effect of endog- enous Sirt2 on the lipoylation of PDH. Effective siRNA- mediated knockdown of Sirt2 was confirmed. Notably, Sirt2 knockdown led to an elevated lipoylation level in DLA. Concomitantly, increased PDH activity was also observed. These results demonstrated that Sirt2 can effectively catal-", "type": "Document"}}
