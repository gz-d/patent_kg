It should be appreciated that such systems and compo- nents can include those components or sub-components specified therein, some of the specified components or sub- components, and/or additional components. Sub-compo- nents could also be implemented as components communi- catively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components. Further yet, one or more compo- nents and/or sub-components may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality. The compo- nents may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein for the sake of brevity, but known by those of skill in the art.\n\nFIG. 33 illustrates a diagram of a graph 3300 of respective power loss of the multi-phase SDSR (e.g., of system 2100) and a conventional diode rectifier under the mains operations of 110V (up to 1 kW output power) and 220V (up to 1.95 kW output power), in an aspect. As can be seen from the graph 3300, at 1 kW and 110V operation, the multi-phase SDSR can realize a 69% power loss reduction in relation to the conven- tional diode rectifier. At 1.95 kW and 220V operation, the multi-phase SDSR can realize a power loss reduction of 61% as compared to the conventional diode rectifier.", "type": "Document"}}
