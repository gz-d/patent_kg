[0108] The computing device 900 also includes at least\n\none communication interface 927. The communication interface 927 allows software and data to be transferred between computing device 900 and external devices via a communication path 926. In various embodiments of the inventions, the communication interface 927 permits data to be transferred between the computing device 900 and a data communication network, such as a public data or private data communication network. The communication interface 927 may be used to exchange data between different com- puting devices 900 which such computing devices 900 form part an interconnected computer network. Examples of a communication interface 927 can include a modem, a net- work interface (such as an Ethernet card), a communication port (such as a serial, parallel, printer, GPIB, IEEE 1394, RJ45, USB), an antenna with associated circuitry and the like. The communication interface 927 may be wired or may be wireless. Software and data transferred via the commu- nication interface 927 are in the form of signals which can be electronic, electromagnetic, optical or other signals capable of being received by communication interface 927. These signals are provided to the communication interface\n\nvia the communication path 926.\n\n[0109] As shown in FIG. 9, the computing device 900 further includes a display interface 902 which performs operations for rendering images to an associated display 904 and an audio interface 952 for performing operations for playing audio content via associated speaker(s) 957.\n\na\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\n[0110]\n\nAs used herein, the term \u201ccomputer program prod-", "type": "Document"}}
