The p type semiconductor elements comprise Tin Telluride (SnTe). The semiconductor elements are disposed on the substrate by a process of deposition by thermal evaporation of high purity (e.g. 99.99%) PbTe and SnTe respectively. The deposition is performed at a working pressure of approx. 5x10~\u00b0 mBar and a deposition rate of approximately 10 A/s for the SnTe and 15 A/s for the PbTe. The dimensions and shape of each of the semiconductor elements are achieved by using a metal shadow mask over the substrate. As shown in FIG. 3B steps 304 and 306 utilise a metal shadow mask over the substrate to achieve the desired shape of the semiconductor elements. The metal shadow mask includes openings that are shaped as rectangular legs i.e. rectangular members such that the semiconductor elements form a corresponding shape on the substrate 102. The thickness of the openings in the mask is 500 micrometres such that the semiconductor elements are 500 micrometres. As shown in FIG. 3B, three n type semiconductor elements are deposited onto the substrate and three p type semiconductor elements are deposited onto the\n\n[0169] Step 308 comprises depositing conductor members (including bridging conductor members). The conductor members are aluminium foil. As shown in FIG. 3B, multiple aluminium foils are deposited using a further shadow mask. The mask includes openings such that the conductor mem- bers are deposited perpendicular to the semiconductor ele- ments. The conductor members i.e. the aluminium foils are 50 nm thick.
