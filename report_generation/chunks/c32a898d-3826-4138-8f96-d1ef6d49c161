Generally, the ratio of the\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates the changing potential between the\n\nentrance area of the neck 23 to the top area of the evaporation\n\nsample holder and the opening of the inlet conduit,\n\nFIG. 4 shows as an example the depth of implantation of\n\nchamber 17 should be more than 4.\n\nThe sulfur vapor 19 that escapes from the evaporation\n\nsulfur atoms using the apparatus of the embodiment of FIG.1.\n\n40\n\nchamber 17 is fed to the feed conduit 4 through an input valve\n\n12 controlled by manually operable valve control means 14.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED\n\nInput valve 12 is provided with a valve heating means 13\n\nEMBODIMENTS\n\nsimilar to heating device 16 in order to prevent the sulfur\n\nvapor being deposited in the input valve 12 or in the feed\n\nReferring firstly to FIG. 1 there is shown a FEFE-PBII\n\n45\n\nconduit 4.

The implantation\n\nargon to facilitate the transfer of the Sulfur vapor along the\n\nchamber 2 is a smaller chamber made of an insulating mate\n\nfeed conduit 4. The carrier gas can be fed in from side wall of\n\nthe evaporation chamber 17 or other places around the cham\n\nrial Such as glass which serves to protect the remainder of the\n\nvacuum chamber from contamination by the vapor that is\n\nber not shown here.", "type": "Document"}}
