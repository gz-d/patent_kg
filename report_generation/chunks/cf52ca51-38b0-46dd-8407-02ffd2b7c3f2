In an aspect, the one or more solar cell(s) can be positioned proximate to the reflective ground plane as described above regarding determination of H and 6 with respect to FIGS. 3-6, thus facilitating receipt of reflected solar radiation.\n\nIn further non-limiting implementations, selective trans- mission layers (e.g., coatings or overlays 802, etc.) of solar energy collection antennas can include a metal grid (e.g., a grid of a metal, a metal wire, or a metallic composition, etc.), as further described above regarding FIGS. 7-8. In yet other non-limiting implementations, given the predetermined wavelengths of the incident solar radiation and the reflected. communications signals, the grid can be further configured or adapted with a grid spacing (e.g., grid spacing d 804) to maximize the reflected communications signals, maximize transmission of the incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.), or effect any other desired design tradeoff between these and/or other considerations.\n\nAccording to further non-limiting implementations of solar energy collection antenna, the one or more antenna element(s) (e.g., SPA 102, etc.) can be configured to reflect a portion of the incident solar radiation (e.g., incident light 322 (522), etc.) (e.g., a second portion) to increase the reflected solar radiation. As further described above, the one or more antenna element(s) (e.g., SPA 102, etc.) can be adapted to receive excitation via an L-probe 104 proximate to the ground plane (e.g., ground plane 108, a non-planar reflective ground plane such as V-shaped concave ground plane 304, U-shaped. concave ground plane 504, and the like, etc.).", "type": "Document"}}
