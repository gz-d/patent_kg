Specifically, FIG. 36 illustrates the shared aperture technique arranged to emit two independently modulated waves by the universal metasurface antenna, in which each sub-metasurface is responsible for one modulated waveform generation. FIG. 37 illustrates the synthesis process of the STC film for dual-channel wireless communications. Briefly, in this example, the bit stream for each sub-meta- surface is first mapped to the corresponding STC film according to the desired conversion harmonic frequency, polarization, and signal modulation format. The final STC film for dual-channel multiplexing is the sum of the two STC films for the two interwoven sub-metasurfaces. FIGS. 38 and 39 illustrate the measured radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna at the m=-1 (CH1) and m=-2 (CH2) harmonic frequencies. In FIGS. 38 and 39, the main beam directions of CH1 and CH2 are pointing to (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0) and (30\u00b0 and -30\u00b0) respectively. The insets on the right in FIGS. 38 and 39 illustrate the measured decoded constella-\n\ntion diagrams of the two channels at the receiver end.
