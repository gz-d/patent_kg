After considering the pressure distri- butions according to the flow resistances, the effective pressure difference of the main flow section is\n\nR Pag = Pave Bp ey = 99.6% Pai\n\nwhere\n\n[0125] Peris the effective pressure difference of the main flow section\n\n[0126] P.,,:,. is the driving pressure applied on the whole microfluidic device\n\n[0127] Since every confining microfluidic channel is con- nected in parallel with the main flow section, the pressure difference between inlets and outlets is similar to the flow section pressure. Therefore, the pressure applied to the cells are similar to the pressure difference between inlets and outlets of microfluidic channels.\n\nNuclear Size and Elasticity Distributions of Measured.
