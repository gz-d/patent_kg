In an aspect, the barrier control component 400 can include a com- municator component 402 that can facilitate communication (e.g., transmission, reception) of information between com- ponents within the barrier control component 400 or commu- nication between the barrier control component 400 and other components (e.g., barrier component, display screen compo- nent) associated with the barrier control component 400. The communicator component 402 can communicate data via a wireline or wireless communication connection using one or more specified communication protocols and one or more of communication wireless\n\nThe barrier control component 400 can comprise an iden- tification component 412 that can operate in conjunction with the analyzer component 410 to identify a control signal based at least in part on the detected optical signal.
