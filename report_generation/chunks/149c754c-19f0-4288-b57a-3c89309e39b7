The method comprises identifying a part of the electronic circuit or system that exhibits capaci- tance, determining a value of a series parasitic effect associ- ated with the part of the electronic circuit or system that exhibits capacitance, sensing a voltage signal across the part of the electronic circuit or system, determining from the sensed voltage signal and the value of the series parasitic effect, a parasitic voltage associated with the part of the electronic circuit or system, and adding a voltage source in series with the part of the electronic circuit or system, the voltage source being adapted to deliver a compensating volt- age of generally equal magnitude but generally in opposite\n\nPreferably, the added voltage source comprises an active source.\n\nThe added voltage source may comprise any of: a passive circuit; a linear-type voltage source; or a switched-mode volt- source.\n\nWhere the series parasitic effect comprises a series induc- tive effect, the electronic circuit or system may comprise a differentiator circuit to differentiate the sensed voltage signal and a voltage driver circuit to generate the compensating voltage.\n\nWhere the series parasitic effect comprises a series resis- tive effect, the electronic circuit or system may comprise multiplier circuit to determine the compensating voltage from the sensed voltage signal and a voltage driver circuit to gen- erate the compensating voltage.\n\nPreferably, the added voltage source comprises an active voltage source.\n\nThe added voltage source may be implemented using any a passive circuit; a linear-type voltage source; or switched-mode voltage source.", "type": "Document"}}
