According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the solder alloy composition may comprise 50% to 99% of the present Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles by weight. In one working example, the solder alloy composition comprises 50% of the present Sn\u2014Bi\u2014 In base alloy solder particles. In another working example, the solder alloy composition comprises 90% of the present Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy solder particles.\n\n[0062] By the virtue of the above features, the present application provides an improved solder alloy composition containing Sn Bi \u4e00 In base solder particles respectively about sub-micron in sizes and are useful for enhancing 3D packaging.\n\nIC\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n[0063] Materials and Methods\n\nJan. 11, 2024\n\n[0064] Preparation of the Present Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 in Base Solder Particles", "type": "Document"}}
