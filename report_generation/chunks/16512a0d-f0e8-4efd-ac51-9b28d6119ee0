The imaging device may include, but not limited to, a microscope, an imager and a camera. The sample may be a compressed air or gas source.\n\n[0070] FIG. 2A illustrates laminar flow simulation results ofa single microfluidic channel containing a captured cell in accordance with an example embodiment. The flow along the confining microfluidic channel is laminar with a very small Reynolds number (<<1), given the micro-scale of the dimensions of the microfluidic channel. The simulation is calculated using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a and a repre- sentative normalized pressure distribution of the microflu- idic channel is shown in FIG. 2A.\n\n[0071] FIG. 2B illustrates a graph showing the effective drag force on cells of various sizes captured in a microfluidic channel based on the simulation results of FIG. 2A. The pressure distribution around a cell with a size ranging from 6 hm to 20 lm against the penetration length along the microfluidic channel is analyzed. The surface stress around the cell is integrated to obtain the effective drag force on the captured cell and the computed drag forces is plotted in the line graph in FIG. 2B.\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\n[0072] As shown in FIG. 2B, the drag force scales linearly with the driving pressure because of the laminar flow characteristics. Therefore, under a steady driving pressure, the values of the penetration length L and cell diameter D can be used to calculate the drag force over the captured cell based on the numerical interpolation of values plotted on the line graph of FIG. 2B.\n\nFIG. 3A illustrates diagrams of a captured whole\n\n[0073]", "type": "Document"}}
