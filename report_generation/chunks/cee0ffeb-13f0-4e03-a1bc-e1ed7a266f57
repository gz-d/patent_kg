In such case the sO, can be determined. from the photoacoustic signals at two wavelengths (e.g., 532 nm and 558 nm) as follows\n\n\u00b0 =a ra) 1\n\nwhere\n\npa Hes - Ps ol \u4e94 \u5165\n\nP, ; and F, , are the photoacoustic amplitudes and optical fluences at A,=532 nm and A,=558 nm, es \u201c and \u00b0\u00b0 are the molar extinction coefficients of deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO,) at the two wavelengths.\n\n[0075] In another embodiment in which three-pulse exci- tation is applied, the first and second pulses may increase the amplitude of the third photoacoustic signal, leading to an underestimated or otherwise inaccurate sO,.
