In the EMHMM with co-clustering method of invention the co-clustering formulation ensures that the participant groups are consistent across all stimuli and the quantitative assessment using log-likelihood measures enables determination of the relationships of eye movement patterns with a variety of cognitive measures. Using the methods of the instant invention, types of scene images that induce larger individual differences in eye movement patterns can be determined and object recognition performance and cognitive abilities of individuals be measured based on eye\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nmovement patterns during scene viewing.\n\nIn some embodiments, EMHMMs of the instant invention use HMMs to model eye movements, where the hidden states of the HMMs are directly associated with regions of interest (ROIs) of eye movements and the temporal dynamics of eye movements are determined in terms of ROIs and transitions among ROIs.\n\nIn\n\nsome\n\nembodiments,\n\nindividual\n\nHMMs\n\nare\n\nclustered\n\nto\n\ndetect representative", "type": "Document"}}
