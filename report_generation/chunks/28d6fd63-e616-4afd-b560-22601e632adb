The electrolyte may also be applied to diverse flexible electrical energy storage devices.\n\nhaving AD-gel electrolyte that provides excellent water retention property may be fabricated. In this embodiment, the electrodes are wrapped inside the polyelectrolyte. The manufacturing process of the rechargeable Zn\u2014Mn0O, bat- tery based AD-gel electrolyte (AD-battery) 1400 is sche- matically illustrated in FIG. 14. The prepared electrodes were first fixed nominally in the middle of two glass plates by utilizing a 2 mm thick silicone spacer which also serving as a reaction mould for polyelectrolyte. Next, a solution containing various precursors was injected into the reaction mould and an AD-gel electrolyte was obtained after the photo-induced free radical polymerization. After that, the elastomeric coating process of the as-prepared battery was performed by dipping the battery into a silane precursor solution for five times, followed by drying the battery in an oven. In addition, pure PAM-hydrogel electrolyte based Zn\u2014Mn0O, battery (PAM-battery) was also fabricated as the\n\n[0219] The ionic conductivity of the AD-gel maintained a similar value of 14.1 mS cm7! even at -20\u00b0 C. (FIG, 12A). This may be ascribed to highly porous structure of the AD-gel under such temperature. As shown in FIG. 12B, the highly porous structure of the AD-gel was maintained after subjecting to freeze-dry for 24 h. The abundant microphores within the polymer matrix provides a large amount of channels for zinc ion transportation, rendering highly ionic conductivity of the AD-gel even under a low temperature.", "type": "Document"}}
