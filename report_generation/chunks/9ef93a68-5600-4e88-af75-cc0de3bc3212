An inter encoding mode \u2018predicts\u2019 the content of a particular lock (a source block) on the basis of another block (called a reference block) in a different frame (which may be one or more frames before or after the frame containing the block ing predicted). This is called inter-prediction as the predic- tion is based in blocks in other frames. The residual block is the difference between the predicted block and the source lock. The residual block is encoded by using an image trans- form, quantizing and entropy encoding. The encoded residual block is stored together with coding data identifying the ref- erence block used and the particular inter-prediction mode used. The coding data may for example comprise a motion vector relating the reference block and the predicted block. During decoding the predicted block is computed from the coding data and the source block is reconstructed by adding the predicted block to the (decoded) residual block. There may be several different possible inter-prediction modes, each based on different block sizes, different reference blocks", "type": "Document"}}
