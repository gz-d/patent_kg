In practice, however, there may still be some issues that need addressing for the charging platform of WO03/105308 to gain widespread acceptance. One issue, for example, is use of the charging platform with electrical devices that are not provided with an integral secondary coil. One approach to this is also described in WO03/105308 and uses adaptors that are provided with secondary coils that can receive magnetic flux from the surface of the charging platform and output a DC to conventional socket.\n\nThe secondary winding may be formed either integrally the body portion of the device itself, or may be formed integrally with a cap or other form of protective device that adapted to fit over the body portion.\n\nPreferably, especially if the body of the electrical device is formed of metal either completely or substantially, magnetic\n\nFurthermore, even with electrical devices provided with an integral secondary coil, for certain devices locating a second-\n\nThis application claims priority to United Kingdom Appli-\n\nTo overcome this problem, at least one wireless charging\n\nthe device.\n\nvoltage\n\na\n\ncharging\n\n10\n\n15\n\n30\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n65\n\ncoil in\n\nsuitable\n\nbe easier than it\n\nbe for\n\ncoil will be close to and parallel to the charging surface.\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided an\n\nelectrical device.\n\nwith\n\nis\n\nUS 8,836,278 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nshielding may be provided between the secondary winding\n\nrechargeable batteries (e.g., rechargeable battery 3) that are\n\ndesigned to be charged by the charging platform.
