Referring again to FIG. 6, each of the wearers is asked to wear on the detector DD through their index finger, and then is asked to perform the known microgestures (a) to (j). After that, each of the wearers is asked to rate each of the known microgestures (a) to (j) according to three criteria along a 7-point Likert-scale (1: strongly disagree to 7: strongly agree).\n\nThe criteria 1, \u201cEase to perform\u201d is abbreviated as \u201cEase\u201d the FIG. 6, means that it is easy to perform this gesture precisely for the wearer.\n\nin\n\nThe criteria 2, \u201cSocial acceptance\u201d is abbreviated \u201cSocialAcc\u201d in the FIG. 6, means that the microgesture performed without social concern.\n\nbe\n\n(4).\n\n40\n\nThe criteria 3, \u201cFatigue\u201d in the FIG. 6, means that the microgesture makes the wearer tired.\n\n(4)\n\nWhere SSac represents a between-clusters sum of square, SS we tepresents an inter-cluster sum of square, K is the total number of clusters, and N is the total number of samples. With the ground truth cluster label for each gesture sample in the latent space feature point, SS,,, and SSwe can be calculated as the following equations (5), (6):\n\n\u592a Scale =a? \u00ae\n\n45\n\nThus, based on the result of preferences of the wearers shown in the FIG. 6, a microgesture set including micro- gestures (a)~(i) (e.g., as marked as a light gray shade region in the FIG. 6) is determined (or selected), and the micro- gesture (j) (e.g., as marked as a dark gray shade region in the FIG. 6) is not to be selected due to low wearer preferences.", "type": "Document"}}
