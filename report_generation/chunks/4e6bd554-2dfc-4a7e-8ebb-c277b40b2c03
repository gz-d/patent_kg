Impor- tant aspects of the invention include mounting a generally non-planar transparent DR on a circuit to perform a normal known function of said DR. The DR is mounted on another component so as to at least partially occupy a footprint of another component of the circuit. The another component is preferably a light processing component, namely a compo- nent such as a solar cell that processes received light to generate an electrical output or a light generating device such as a lamp or an LED that converts electrical energy to light energy. As such, by mounting the DR in the manner proposed, the DR can act as a protective cover for the light processing component whilst allowing light to pass therethough and even enhance the performance of the light processing component. In fact, where the DR is shaped as a lens or the like, it can act to enhance the performance of the light processing element by concentrating light energy onto a selected area. Further- more, the DR does not require its own footprint thereby saving space on the circuit which is very useful in the design and manufacture of compact device such as wireless commu- nication devices, although the invention is not limited to only", "type": "Document"}}
