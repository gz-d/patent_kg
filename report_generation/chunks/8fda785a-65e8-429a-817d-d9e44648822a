Also, upon the end of the charging rocess, the C, can be recharged by the other two capacitors. Thus, the reversible and eflicient charge transfer between TO and drain provides a pathway for the conversion of the ydrodynamic energy stored in the configurable, gate-like droplet. Indeed, as discussed in FIG. 3d, for the impinging droplet with a larger We, more electricity generation is achieved as a result of the presence of larger spreading area for charge transfer. Notably, during the entire process, the virtual source (PTFE electret) preserves a constant charge density owing to its high charge stability, as confirmed by the reversible charge measurement discussed in FIG. 3c. Still, the hydrodynamic-to-electrical energy conversion can be improved by the control of higher charge density of the PTFE electret.", "type": "Document"}}
