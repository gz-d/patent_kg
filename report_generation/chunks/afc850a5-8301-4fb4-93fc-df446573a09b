Thus, varia- tions of the disclosed embodiments as suggested by the dis- closed apparatuses, systems and methodologies are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the subject matter isclosed herein. For example, the various embodiments of the apparatuses, systems and methodologies of the disclosed. subject matter are described in the context of wireless com- munication systems and components. However, as further detailed below, various exemplary implementations can be applied to other areas of wireless communications, optical applications, without departing from the subject matter lescribed herein.\n\nFIGS. 7-8 depict yet another exemplary implementation of a GA, comprising a non-limiting parabolic reflector antenna and a conformal overlaid solar cell according to further aspects as described herein, where FIG. 7 depicts a non- limiting parabolic reflector antenna fed by an exemplary horn antenna, and FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary non-limiting solar cell comprising a coating or overlay as further described herein;\n\nFIGS. 9-10 depict simulated and measured characteristics of an exemplary non-limiting single-element SPA, where\n\nthe\n\nsuch Accordingly, various embodiments for solar\n\ncollec-\n\ndescribed.\n\nwith\n\nof\n\nillustrate\n\nembodi-\n\na\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nFIG. sponding\n\ncorre-\n\nway\n\n(S\n\nfor\n\nin\n\nnon-\n\nand\n\ncell of\n\nUS 8,599,081 B2\n\n6\n\n5\n\ntage, the dual function characteristic (e.g., radiating for wire\n\nAs used herein, the term \u201cGreen Antenna (GA) is intended\n\nless communication and Solar energy focusing or collecting)\n\nto refer to a dual-function device that can be used simulta\n\nneously as an antenna for wireless communication or other\n\ncan result in cost reductions in the design, fabrication, and/or\n\nwise and as a Solar power collection or generation system.
