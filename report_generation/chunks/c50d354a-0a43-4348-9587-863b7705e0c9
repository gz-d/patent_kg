Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.\n\nIn the methods of preparation described herein, the\n\n[0092]\n\nsteps can be carried out in any order without departing from the principles of the invention, except when a temporal or operational sequence is explicitly recited. Recitation in a claim to the effect that first a step is performed, and then several other steps are subsequently performed, shall be taken to mean that the first step is performed before any of the other steps, but the other steps can be performed ln any suitable sequence, unless a sequence 1s further recited within the other steps. For example, claim elements that recite \u201cStep A, Step B, Step C, Step D, and Step E\u201d shall be construed to mean step A is carried out first, step E 1s carried out last, and steps B, C, and D can be carried out in any sequence between steps A and E, and that the sequence still falls within the literal scope of the claimed process. A given step or sub-set of steps can also be repeated. Furthermore, specified steps can be carried out concurrently unless explicit claim language recites that they be carried out\n\nseparately.", "type": "Document"}}
