However, if the flashlight body is made of metal or some other conductive material, then there may be problem in that the magnetic flux from the charging surface may induce currents in the body of the flashlight. Apart from being inefficient, this could cause the flashlight body to heat and either damage the flashlight or cause potential injury to anybody picking tip the flashlight.\n\nFIG. 1is aside view of one example of an electric flashlight according to one aspect of the invention placed upon a planar inductive charging platform,\n\nFIG. 2 is a side view of another example of a flashlight according to another aspect of the invention, and\n\nFIG. 3 shows detail for a variation of the example of\n\nFIG. 3 shows a variation of the example of FIG. 2 that is designed to mitigate the above-noted problem. In particular, in the example of FIG. 3, the cap 15 is provided with an interior layer 7 of magnetic material that when in use will be located between the cap 15 (formed with secondary winding 16) and the remainder of the flashlight body. This layer of magnetic material serves to shield the main body of the flash- light from the magnetic flux and thus increases the charging efficiency and reduces the potential heating of the flashlight body.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nReferring to FIG. 1 there is shown an electric device such as a flashlight 1 that is placed on a planar charging surface 10 of a charging platform 2. The charging platform 2 is of the type described in WO03/105308, and in particular generates lines of magnetic flux that extend perpendicular to the charg- ing surface. The flashlight 1 is provided with one or more\n\nto", "type": "Document"}}
