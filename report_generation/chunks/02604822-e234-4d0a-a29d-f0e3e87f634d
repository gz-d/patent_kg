Formation of a paste typically includes steps of mixing alloy solder powders (e.g., the present Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder powders), flux, binders, and, if necessary, a solvent, to create a homogeneous paste. The solder paste is then typically vacuumed to remove any trapped air bubbles. The thus-produced solder paste com- position can be further tested to verify its viscosity and performance, according to practical needs. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the alloy solder powders are Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder powders, which are preferably composed of a plurality of the present Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder particles, wherein each solder particles is less than 10 hm in diameter. Examples of the flux suitable for used in the present solder paste composition typically includes, but are not limited to, resin, organic acids (such as citric acid or hydrochloric acid), and inorganic compounds (e.g., halogens). Examples of binder suitable used in the present solder paste composition include, but are not limited to, resins, phthalates, glycols, cellulose, acrylic polymers, and the like. Additionally or alternatively, a solvent is added to adjust the viscosity of the solder paste. The solvent suitable for use in the present disclosure is typically a low-boiling point organic compound that evaporates quickly\n\nwhen heated, for example, ethanol.", "type": "Document"}}
