FIG. 14(a) shows the photograph of the 3D printed terahertz metalenses. A good profile of the 3D printed metalens is observed. Holes at an angular spacing of 22.5\u00b0 on the periphery of the metalenses are used for alignment and assembly purpose. A terahertz planar near-field scanning measurement setup was built to measure the performance of the 3D printed focus-steering metalens. A pair of frequency extenders (OML V0O3VNA2- T/R) is used to extend the operating frequency of the vector network analyzer (Agilent N5245A) up to 220-325 GHz. A pair of DC power sources is utilized as the power supply for the two OML extenders. One extender on a 3-axis transla- tional stage is used to measure the field from the receiving probe, while another one is connected to the device under test (DUT). A piece of absorber (Eccosorb LS-30) is placed on the front metallic surface of each of the two extenders to suppress possible multiple reflections. The extenders and translational stage are placed on an optical table with\n\nvibration control (Newport S-2000 Stabilizer).\n\n[0062] The radiation performance of Metalens #1 is mea- sured. The feed horn is vertically polarized with the electric field parallel to the y,-axis. For this demonstration, only Metalens #1 is placed in front of the feed horn with g,-0\u00b0.
