Compared with the existing interventional treatment methods, application of an external magnetic field to controlling of one or more microrobots carrying cells for treatment according to the or more embodiments can greatly reduce the trauma to the human body. Moreover, compared with one or more other existing noninvasive methods for actuating microrobots through optical tweezer, ultrasound, chemistry, etc., the driving force according to the or more embodiments is not affected by the propagation medium. Magnetic driving does not cause harm to the human body by field.\n\nusing an external magnetic\n\n[0044] Further, for many existing systems, a microrobot must meet specific requirements in structural design (e.g., a helical structure) to transform the torque into the driving force, and thereby complicating microrobot design and decreasing reliability. One or more embodiments as described herein avoid such unfavorable requirements. The actuation subject (or called magnetized object or objects) can be driven to the highest potential field to realize driving of the actuation subject.\n\n[0045] FIG. 1 illustrates a system for generating a mag- netic field according to certain embodiments of the present invention. The magnetic field can facilitate an actuation subject, such as microagent, microrobot, etc., such that the actuation subject migrates to a target site or area or performs certain tasks.\n\n[0046] For illustrating purpose only, the system includes an electromagnetic device 102 and an electromagnetic device 104. Each electromagnetic device includes one or more magnetic components and can be energized by a proper electrical power supply to generate magnetic field. For example, a solenoid may be energized to create mag- netic field.", "type": "Document"}}
