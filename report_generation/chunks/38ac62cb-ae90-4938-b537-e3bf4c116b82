The vapor may be fed to said feed conduit with a carrier gas. The vapor is preferably generated in said evaporation chamber in a state of quasi-equilibrium. To achieve this the evaporation chamber may provided with an exit opening through which vapor escapes to pass to said feed conduit, and wherein the dimensions of said exit opening are relatively small compared to the internal dimensions of the evaporation chamber and wherein the diameter of the feed conduit is relatively small compared to its length to maintain\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided appa- ratus for focused electric field enhanced plasma-based ion implantation comprising, an implantation chamber, a vacuum pump for maintaining the pressure in said implantation cham- ber at a desired level, a sample holder, means for applying a negative potential to said sample holder, and means for sup- plying a gaseous or vaporized implantation material, wherein said supplying means comprises an feed conduit having an\n\nConventionally, in a PBI method, a plasma source is pro-\n\nPIII would be very desirable.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nAccording to another aspect of the invention there is pro-\n\naccelerated towards the sample for implantation therein.\n\nan\n\nof is\n\nthe\n\nThe implantation material may be generated by evaporat-\n\nsaid quasi-equilibrium state.\n\nUS 8,119,208 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nAlternatively the implantation material may be gaseous\n\nconventional plasma generating means 22 which may take\n\nany conventional form.
