Inside the battery pack are the electric \u201ccells\u201d 704 and a \u201ccharging protection circuit\u201d 706 as shown in FIG. 8. Two mechanical contacts 702 and 708 are connected to the posi- tive and negative terminals of the battery through the charging protection circuit. The cells form the battery and the charging protection circuit ensures that the battery is charged in a specified manner. FIG. 9 shows the functional block diagram 900 of the battery pack of FIGS. 7 and 8. The input positive and negative terminals of the charging protection circuit are labeled as IN+ 902 and IN- 904, respectively.
