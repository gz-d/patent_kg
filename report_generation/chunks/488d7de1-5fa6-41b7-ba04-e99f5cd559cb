For example, an implantable titanium alloy with a coating of controllable release antimicrobial peptide on its outer- most surface can be fabricated by surface treatments such as conventional coating and plasma spraying. [0036] The antimicrobial peptide on the plasma treated titanium alloy according to an embodiment is fabricated to provide a controllable manner in which the antimicro- bial peptides will be cleaved off from the substrate surface by the proteins or enzymes secreted by those incoming microorganisms. [0037] The subject implantable titanium alloy with an- timicrobial peptide coating possesses a manner of con- trollable release. The antimicrobial peptides will be cleaved off from the titanium surface when the proteins or enzymes secreted by the particular incoming bacteria as the bacterial approach the implant. The released pep- tides can then terminate the incoming microorganisms. In an embodiment of antibacterial peptide immobilized titanium alloy orthopaedic implants, the V8 protease se- creted by the Staphylococcus aureus cleaves the peptide bonding of the antibacterial peptide at the C-terminal side of glutamic acid. This mechanism is demonstrated in Fig. 7. The controllable release mechanism of antibacterial peptides can be applied to orthopaedic, dental and car- diovascular implants so as to work against bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella Dublin, Es- cherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Strepto- coccus mutans, etc. [0038] In order to immobilize the antimicrobial peptides onto the titanium surfaces, reactive functional groups and linkers are preferably incorporated to the metallic sub- strate", "type": "Document"}}
