The detailed training process is fully described in the following paragraphs.\n\nIn some embodiments, the signal generator SG is an oscillator to provide a square wave AC electrical signal.\n\nReferring to FIG. 2 again, each of the conductive elec-\n\ntrode portions CP1 wraps the side portion SP1 of the top insulating layer 112a. Specifically, each of the conductive electrode portions CP1 extends from a top surface of the side portion SP1 to a bottom surface of the side portion SP1 through a side surface of the side portion SP1. Each of the enameled wires EW extends from the corresponding con- ductive electrode portion CP1 to a position on the corre- sponding receiving electrode portion RP, such that the corresponding conductive electrode portion CPl may be coupled to the corresponding receiving electrode portion RP. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the circuit board CB may be coupled to the receiving electrode layer 114 through the conductive wires CW, the conductive electrode portions CP1, and the enameled wires EW. On the other hand, the circuit board CB may be coupled to the transmitting elec- trode layer 116 through the conductive electrode portion CP2. Thus, the elements of the circuit board CB may be coupled to the receiving electrode layer 114 and the trans- mitting electrode layer 116 through the aforesaid configu-\n\nration.
