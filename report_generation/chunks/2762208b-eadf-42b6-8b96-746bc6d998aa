The additional voltage (Curve Y) due to the magnetic flux generated by the auxiliary winding in the cen- tral region compensates for the central voltage sag phenom- enon in the planar charging platform. FIG. 10 shows a prac- tical example of a charging platform with such an auxiliary winding excited in the same way as the first primary coil. It can be seen that the voltage sag is greatly reduced. This experimental result confirms the improvement of the charg- ing ability of the charging platform due to the auxiliary wind- ing.\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n1. A battery charging apparatus comprising:\n\nan inductive charging platform including a charging sur- face on which an electrical device to be charged is to be placed;\n\na first winding for generating lines of magnetic flux gen- erally perpendicular to the charging surface;\n\nanda second winding located within an area defined by the first winding for generating an auxiliary magnetic flux generally perpendicular to the charging surface, such that magnetic flux generated by said second winding compensates for a reduction in magnetic flux generated by said first winding, thereby generating magnetic flux substantially uniformly over the surface of the charging platform.\n\nIt will be understood that the flux generated by the first primary winding is greater than the flux generated by the auxiliary second winding. The purpose of the second winding is to compensate for the voltage sag phenomenon and there- fore the second winding is driven such that it generates suf- ficient flux to provide this compensation without going too far and resulting in a voltage peak where the second winding is located.\n\n2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said second winding is located concentrically with respect to said first winding.", "type": "Document"}}
