A method according to claim 1 wherein the pressure said implantation chamber is maintained above a breakdown pressure and high enough to maintain a steady-state glow discharge between said sample holder and said feed conduit exit opening.\n\nlocating a sample on a sample holder in an implantation chamber, supplying gaseous or vaporized implantation material to said implantation chamber through a feed conduit, said feed conduit having an end that opens into said implantation chamber and above said sample holder to form a feed conduit exit opening, wherein said end and said feed conduit exit openings formed by said end define a feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, and wherein said sample holder defines a sample holder cross-sectional area situated opposite from said feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, said feed con- duit exit opening cross-sectional area being smaller than said sample holder cross-sectional and\n\n11. The method according to claim 1 wherein the sample holder cross-sectional area is in a ratio greater than 6 with feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area.\n\n12. Amethod of performing plasma based ion implantation comprising:", "type": "Document"}}
