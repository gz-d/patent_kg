Preferably, the modified protein is a Streptococcus aureus Cas9 protein. A mutation of an amino acid alters the amino acid to an amino acid other than the wild-type amino acid. Alternatively, a mutation may be resulted from a deletion of an amino acid residue in the amino acid sequence or an addition of one or more amino acid residues into the amino acid sequence, thereby altering the binding activity between the amino acid sequence and the target sequence. In an example embodiment, the mutation is a single amino acid. substitution whereby the wild-type amino acid is changed to any amino acid other than the wild-type amino acid. In a preferred embodiment, the mutation changes the wild-type\n\npresent to a protein use in altering the genome of a cell. Particularly, the inven- tion relates to a modified Streptococcus aureus Cas9 (Sa- Cas9) protein and its use in genomic engineering, genome targeting and genome editing technologies. For example, one of the applications of the modified proteins is as RNA-guided clustered, regularly interspaced, short palin- dromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 proteins, for example a SaCas9 modified protein. A limitation of CRISPR-SaCas9 proteins that restricts broad application are their activities on off-target sites with the potential to induce undesired off- target mutations and disrupt the functionality of otherwise normal", "type": "Document"}}
