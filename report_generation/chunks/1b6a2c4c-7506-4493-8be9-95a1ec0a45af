The system includes a membrane-based thermochemical reactor. The reactor includes a solution channel having an absorbent-containing solution flowing therethrough and a refrigerant channel having a refrigerant flowing therethrough along with first and second fluid chan- nels. A porous membrane is positioned between the refrig- erant channel and the solution channel; the porous mem- brane permits flow of vapor molecules therethrough while restricting flow of absorbent molecules. The system further includes a solution storage repository in fluid communica- tion with the solution channel and a refrigerant repository In fluid communication with the refrigerant channel. The sys- tem can be used in high-density, high-efficiency, and low- temperature energy storage systems. The membrane-based reactor offers a large specific surface area and integrates solution/refrigerant flows, which enables formation of a highly compact reactor exhibiting strong heat/mass transfer. In some embodiments, direct diffusion of water molecules through the membrane makes it possible to lower the\n\nF28D 20/00\n\nFOLK 3/18\n\n(2006.01) (2006.01)\n\nrequired charging temperatures.", "type": "Document"}}
