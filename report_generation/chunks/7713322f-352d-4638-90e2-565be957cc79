The first processor electrically connects the audio source and the acoustic device. The audio source generates a first audio signal, and the first processor extracts a FO component from the first audio signal. The first processor processes the first audio signal with DoME based on a hearing profile and output a second audio signal, and the enhancement weight of the FO component in the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile. The acoustic device outputs the second audio signal to a user.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the FO com- ponent is enhanced by adding a frequency-modulated consisting of only the FO component.\n\nCurrent signal processing methods primarily focus on speech intelligibility and have been proven to be successful\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the frequency- modulated sine is added from -21.1 dB to -6.2 dB.\n\nthe\n\nsign\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the frequency- modulated sing is added from -9.6 dB to -4.3 dB below\n\nLUFS.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the FO com- ponent ranges from 212 Hz to 1.4 kHz.\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the first audio is mid or up-tempo songs.\n\nsignal\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the first audio signal includes a vocal group and an instrumental group, and processing includes adjusting the weights of the vocal group and the instrumental group.\n\nthe\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the signal output comprises a cochlear implant.", "type": "Document"}}
