The closed- loop arrays (FIG. 1C) were simplified as a 2D contact model (FIG. 7A-7C). For the casting step, the numerical model consisted of aPDMS mold and a SU-8 triangular pillar in the center, which were treated as a \u201ccontact pair\u201d. Material properties in the simulation are listed in Table 2. PDMS was defined as a hyperelastic material using the Neo-Hookean material model, and SU-8 was modeled as linear elastic material. The displacement was prescribed at the boundary of PDMS, which caused both PDMS and SU-8 to deform. The region where the von Mises stress exceeds the tensile stress of the PDMS indicates the site of potential failure.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nMaterial properties in the simulation Materials Parameters PDMS in Phase I Density: 970 kg/m?
