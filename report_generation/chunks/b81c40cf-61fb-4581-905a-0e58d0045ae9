For example, a3-D autostereoscopic display based on a parallax barrier can real- ize 3-D visual effects in part by having different pixels car- rying different views (e.g., different two-dimensional (2-D) views) ofa 3-D scene. However, one significant deficiency of using such a parallax barrier is that, when ordinary 2-D con- tent is passed through the parallax barrier, the 2-D content can be degraded (e.g., blurry) when displayed to the viewers.\n\nRear projection systems for displaying 3-D content are relatively rare. Existing rear projection systems for display- ing 3-D content can typically be implemented by overlaying a parallax barrier, or a lenticular lens array on top of the projector screen. However, existing rear projection systems also experience the significant deficiency of using such a parallax barrier in that, when ordinary 2-D content is passed through the parallax barrier associated with the projector screen, the 2-D content can be degraded (e.g., blurry) when displayed to the viewers.", "type": "Document"}}
