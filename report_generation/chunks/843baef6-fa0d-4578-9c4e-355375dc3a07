Notably, the cracking behaviors observed in the present invention are consistent with the prediction shown in the phase diagram (FIG. 8A, FIG. 2B). A finite element analysis (FEA) is also performed to further reveal the stress distri- bution in PDMS molds (FIG. 8B). Indeed, an increase in either r or p leads to both stronger stress and higher local deformation near the neck layer; otherwise, the stress dis-", "type": "Document"}}
