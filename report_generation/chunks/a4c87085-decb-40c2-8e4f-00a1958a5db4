For an ice surface of given area, it is possible to calculate the optimal volume of the hydrophobic solution that may penetrate into the pores of the ice 301 fully, without over supplying the area with solution. This provides a possibility of preventing superposing layers of solution from applying multiple drops of the solution in an attempt to utilise an overly large area.\n\n[0048] Finally, the solvent is removed from the ice 301 by ventilating the top surface of the ice 301. When the solvent has been evaporated away, the solute is left behind as precipitate 403 of the drug. The extent of amalgamation of the precipitate is restrained by the size of the pores 401 in the ice, which is in the nano-metre range. As mentioned, it is preferable that the nanoparticles are left to age in the ice 301 for a period of time before extracting the nanoparticles, such as for another 10 hours, which allows the nanoparticles to re-arrange themselves and stabilize inside the pores.\n\n[0049] FIG. 7 illustrates a comparative prior art ice tem- plate, which is a slab of ice 701 formed in a small beaker 703. The slab of ice 701 can be of any shape but if made in small beaker 703 is often round.\n\na\n\n[0050] Just as it has been described for the 24-well micro- plate 101, to produce ice in a beaker 703, the beaker 703 is filled with deionized water and flash frozen for 10 hour of freezing at minus 20 degrees Celsius. The ice 701 in the beaker 703 is significantly larger than the ice 301 made in each well 103 of the 24-well microplate 101 of FIG. 1. Therefore, to fully use the ice 701 formed in the beaker 703 to make nanoparticles of the drug, the drug solution is dropped all over the surface area of the ice 701 as illustrated in FIG. 7 and in FIG. 8, at 801. However, it is difficult for\n\nDec. 23, 2021", "type": "Document"}}
