The method comprises feeding a gaseous or vaporized\n\nmeans for vaporizing a solid material 18. This vaporizing\n\nimplantation material to an implantation chamber through a\n\n10\n\nmeans comprises an evaporation chamber 17, a heating\n\nfeed conduit, and Supporting a sample to be implanted on a\n\ndevice 16 and a thermally insulating shield 15 designed to\n\nsample holder, the feed conduit having an end that opens into\n\nensure that heat generated by the heating device 16 is directed\n\nthe implantation chamber to form a feed conduit exit opening,\n\ninto the evaporation chamber 17 for greater efficiency rather\n\nthe end and the feed conduit exit opening formed by the end\n\nthan externally of the evaporation chamber 17.
