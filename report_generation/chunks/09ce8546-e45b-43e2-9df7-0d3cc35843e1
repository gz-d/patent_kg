The present method commences from placing a sufficient amount of sulfur powders 150 in the first container 120a, while at the same time, placing a sufficient amount of ammonium per- rhenate 160 evenly at the bottom of the second container 1206, then covering the evenly placed ammonium perrhen- ate 160 with a plurality of molecular sieves 170, finally, mounting a substrate 140 above the molecular sieves 170 without direct contacting them. Preferably, the sulfur pow- ders 150 in the first container 120q and the ammonium perrhenate 160 in the second container 120\u00e9 are present in aratio of 10:1 by weight, such as 10:1, 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1; more preferably, the sulfur powders 150, and the ammonium perrhenate 160 are present in the ratio of 7:1 by weight. Further, the plurality of molecular sieves 170 (e.g., 4 A spherical molecular sieves) are crushed into pieces via use of a mortar. Examples of the substrate suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, a mica substrate, a sapphire substrate etc.", "type": "Document"}}
