Therefore, in another broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a valley-fill circuit for generating a DC output voltage, the circuit including a first capacitor and a second capacitor, wherein the first and second capacitors have different capacitances such that the voltage ripple of the DC output voltage is reduced, and a current source circuit having an inductor.\n\nPreferably means are also provided for reducing the sensi- tivity of the LED power to fluctuations in the AC input supply. This may be achieved, for example, by placing an inductor in series between the AC input supply and the diode rectification circuit. A capacitor may also be provided in parallel between. this input inductor and the diode rectification circuit.\n\nThis input inductor may be a variable inductor that is controllable such that the at least one LED is dimmable. The use of a variable inductor may solely be for providing a dimming function, or may be for reducing the sensitivity of the LED power to fluctuations in the AC input supply in combination with providing a dimming function.\n\nA further broad aspect of the present invention provides a method of generating a DC output by using a valley-fill circuit including a first capacitor and a second capacitor, wherein the first and second capacitors have different capacitances such that a DC output voltage with reduced voltage ripple is gen- erated.", "type": "Document"}}
