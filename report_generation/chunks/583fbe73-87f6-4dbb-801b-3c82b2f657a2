It has been explained in WO03/ 105308 that the primary circuit (ie. equivalent circuit of the inductive battery charging platform) is essentially a L-C reso- nant circuit. By choosing the resonant frequencies of both primary and secondary resonant circuits to be identical or as close as possible, energy transfer between them can be opti- mized. With the use of a core-based planar inductor in this proposal, the inductance value of Lr can be much greater than that of a coreless spiral winding as in the prior art. Therefore, according to the above equation, the resonant frequencies of both of the primary and secondary circuit can be selected at a relatively low frequency range (e.g. 100 kHz to 450 kHz) instead of 950 kHz as in the case of the prior art.\n\nIt should be noted that while the present invention is par- ticularly suited for use with the battery charging platform of W003/105308 it is not limited to use with that platform and. could be used with any battery charging platform in which the lines of flux extend generally perpendicular to the charging surface.", "type": "Document"}}
