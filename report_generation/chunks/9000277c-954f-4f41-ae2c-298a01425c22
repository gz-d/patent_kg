In some other embodiments the control unit includes a field-programmable gate array circuit arranged to provide the control signal to the deflector. The control unit may further include a processor for analyzing an image produced by the imaging apparatus to determine the first and second scanning directions.\n\n[0004] The control unit may be arranged to provide the control signal to the deflector to adjust only one of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction such that the first scanning direction and the second adjusted scanning direction are within the required orthogonality.\n\n[0012] The imaging apparatus may be an electron micro- scope (e.g., a scanning electron microscope) or an inspection apparatus for inspecting objects (such as semiconductors).\n\n[0013] In accordance with a second aspect of the inven- tion, there is provided an imaging apparatus comprising: an electron gun arranged to provide electron beam to scan a specimen, a deflector being arranged to move the electron beam in a first scanning direction and a second scanning direction that are in the same plane for scanning the speci- men; and the control unit of the first aspect. The imaging apparatus may be an electron microscope (e.g., a scanning electron microscope) or an inspection apparatus for inspect-\n\n[0005] The required orthogonality (angle between the first and second scanning directions in the ideal case) may be between 85 degrees to 95 degrees, preferably between 89 degrees to 91 degrees, more preferably about 90 degrees.\n\n[0006] The control unit may be arranged to process the determined first scanning direction and the determined sec- ond scanning direction by comparing the first scanning direction with a first reference direction, and comparing the\n\n[0003]\n\nIn accordance with a first aspect of the invention,", "type": "Document"}}
