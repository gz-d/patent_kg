It will be understood that the DRAs of FIG. 1 or 2 could be employed in a suitable electronic device or system such as a mobile wireless handset, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or even a wireless base station. In fact, where the electronic device comprises a DRA incorporated with a solar cell, the device might comprise any electronic device requiring both a self-contained power source and an ability to wirelessly communicate with other devices or systems. For example, a parking meter having a solar power cell and DRA combination according to the invention would have a self-contained power source for oper- ating the meter and a means of communicating wirelessly to say a control centre when the meter needs emptied or main- tained or the like. The electronic system 300 of FIG. 13 comprises a housing 310 containing control and operational circuitry and at least one combined solar cell and DRA mod- ule 315 according to the invention whereby light impinging on the housing 310 is conveyed to a solar cell (not shown) of the at least one module 315 by its DRA. Alternatively, the electronic system 300 may comprise another form of optical component to that of a solar cell (or in addition to the solar cell) whereby light emitted by said optical component is conveyed to an exterior of the electronic system\u2019s housing\n\ncombined DRA and optical component module 3154, of the invention can be utilized in any device or system that employs a wireless signal radiating element (antenna) and an optical component for transmitting or receiving light at optical fre-\n\nFurthermore, one skilled in the art will recognize that, where the electronic system comprises a filter or oscillator circuit or some other type of electronic circuit, the system may use at least one combined DR and optical component module where the DR does not comprise a DRA but com- prises a DR for a filter, oscillator or other such circuit as will be familiar to one skilled in the art.", "type": "Document"}}
