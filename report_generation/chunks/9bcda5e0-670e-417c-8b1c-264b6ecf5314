The transmission may performed using a probe connected to or of a photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus.\n\nthe be\n\n[0009] In some embodiments of the first aspect, the time difference between transmission of the first and second laser pulses may be in the order of nano-seconds, in the order micro-seconds, in the order of milli-seconds, or ete.\n\nof\n\n[0010] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first wavelength of the first laser pulse and the second wave- length of the second laser pulse are isosbestic wavelengths, e.g., for blood.\n\n[0011] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the method further includes processing one of the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a photoacoustic absorption model to determine particulate concentration in liquid.\n\n[0012] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the sample is a human or animal. In one embodiment of the first aspect, the method is performed in vivo. In one embodiment of the first aspect, the liquid is one or more of: blood, lymphatic fluid, etc. The sample may alternatively be a phantom, a dead object, etc.", "type": "Document"}}
