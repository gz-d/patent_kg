The average skin temperature was 32.4\u00b0 (SD=1.2). The room temperature was controlled as 25\u00b0 C.\n\nC.\n\n[0105] Apparatus\n\nApr. 20, 2023\n\n[0106] The same apparatus was used as those used in Study 2.\n\n[0107] Study Design and Procedure\n\n[0108] Similar to Study 2, a within-subjects study was designed, taking the direction of temperature change and the type of pattern as the independent variables, and the recog- nition accuracy and the response time as the dependent variables. For eachxparticipant, the order of the both-ears thermal patterns was randomized, and each pattern was repeated thrice. There were 4 patterns 2 directions of tem- perature change 3 repetitions=24 trials for each participant. In addition, each participant went through the similar pro- cedure of training and testing as the ones in Study 2.\n\n[0109] Results: Accuracy & Response Time\n\n[0110] A multi-factorlal repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant effect of the type of pattern (F(3,33)=13.28, p<0.005, 712=0.547), but no signifi- cant effect of the direction of temperature changing. Post- hoc pairwise comparison showed that within the hot stimuli, 2h6h yielded significantly lower accuracy (55.6%) than the other three hot stimuli G.e., lhS5h: 94.4%, 3h7h: 94.4%, 4h8h: 80.6%. p<=0.0023). Similar results were found in the cold stimuli, with 2c6c resulting in significantly lower accuracy (33.3%) than the others (1.e., lcSc: 97.2%, 3c7c: 88.9%, 4c8c: 75.0%. p<=0.00042). For the response time, there 1s no significant effect of the type of pattern or the direction of temperature change, with an overall average value of 2.6 seconds\n\n(SD=0.71).\n\n[0111] Discussion of Study 3", "type": "Document"}}
