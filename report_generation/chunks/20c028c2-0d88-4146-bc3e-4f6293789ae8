Although a single processor is shown for the sake of clarity, the computing device 900 may also include a multi- processor system. The processor 907 is connected to a communication infrastructure 906 for communication with other components of the computing device 900. The com- munication infrastructure 906 may include, for example, a communications bus, cross-bar, or network.\n\n[0105] The software routines, or computer programs, may be stored in memory and be executable by the processor to cause the computer system 900 to: receive, from the imaging device, image data of the cell deformed within the micro- fluidic channel at a first deformation level and a second deformation level different from the first deformation level; determine, based on the image data, parameters associated with the deformed cell at the first deformation level and the second deformation level; calculate, using the parameters, a first elastic modulus of the cell at the first deformation level and a second elastic modulus of the cell at the second deformation level; and calculate, using the first and second\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nelastic moduli, a nuclear modulus of the nucleus and cytoplasmic modulus of the cytoplasm.\n\n[0106]\n\nThe computing device 900 further includes a main", "type": "Document"}}
