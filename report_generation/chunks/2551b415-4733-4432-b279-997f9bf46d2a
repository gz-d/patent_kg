In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna that can control all of the fundamental properties of radiated EM waves may operate to control only one or more of the fundamental properties of radiated EM waves. In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna may fur- ther facilitate spatial- and time-varying wave properties, hence enable generation of more complicated waveform, beamforming, direct information manipulations, etc. In some embodiments, the universal metasurface antenna can directly generate modulated EM waves that carry digital information, thus may fundamentally simplify the architec- ture of information transmission systems. In some embodi- ments, all wave manipulations and information modulations are achieved via spatiotemporally switching the ON-OFF coding states of the meta-atoms (subwavelength units) of the metasurface antenna. The metasurface antenna in these embodiments may provide improved EM wave and infor- mation manipulation capabilities, which may be particularly useful in applications such as next-generation wireless sys- tems, cognitive sensing, imaging, quantum optics, quantum.\n\ninformation science, etc.\n\n[0131] FIG. 4A shows a metasurface antenna 400 in embodiment of the invention.
