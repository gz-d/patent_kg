FIG. 13B shows magnetic flux density vs distance relationship for the electromagnetic actuation system of FIG. 13A where the size of workspace is 160 mm. FIG. 13C shows magnetic flux density vs distance relationship where the size of workspace is 100 mm. The vertical axis represents magnetic flux density, while the horizontal axis represents distance.\n\n[0106] As illustrated, coil 1, 4, 5 and 8 are energized with current of 20 A in clockwise direction, while coil 2, 3, 6 and 7 are energized with current of 20 A in counterclockwise direction. Representative magnetic field lines 1301, 1302, 1303, 1304, 1305, 1306, 1307, and 1308 are shown in FIG. 13A, where arrows indicate directions of the magnetic field lines.\n\n[0107] A local minimum point of magnetic flux density is formed in the workspace. Curve 1310a is shown to have a local minimum point 1312a for the workspace of 160 mm. Curve 13104 is shown to have a local minimum point 13125 for the workspace of 100 mm. As the current magnitude in all the eight coils are the same, i.e., 20 A, the magnetic field at the center of the workspace is totally cancelled out and form a 0 mT point (zero-field point) in the workspace. By controlling the specific coordinate (i.e., location) of the local zero-field point, the gradient performance of the system can be enhanced.", "type": "Document"}}
