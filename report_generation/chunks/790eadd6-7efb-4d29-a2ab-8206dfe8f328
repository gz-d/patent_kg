The precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. Reversed database searches were used to evaluate false discovery rate (FDR) of protein and peptide identifications. A maximum of two missed cleavage sites of trypsin was allowed. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as static modi- fication, and oxidation (M) and acetyl (N-terminus) were set as variable modifications. FDR of peptide spectrum matches and peptide identification were determined using the Perco- lator algorithm at 1% based on q-value. The abundance values of proteins were obtained via a label-free quantifi- cation method using Proteome Discoverer 2.2. Minora fea- ture alignment and feature mapping were applied to calcu- late the abundance of peptides in the MS1 scan. Lists of protein identifications and quantification are attached in\n\n[0102] Determination of the First-Order Rate Constant rate constant was calculated by fitting the fluorescence to the following equation:\n\nFluorescence intensity=1\u2014exp(-kr)\n\n[0103] Enzymatic Reaction with Lipoylated Peptides. The lipoylated peptides KAlip-1 to -11 were incubated with sirtuin and cofactor NAD+ at 37\u00b0 C. in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl,, and 2.7 mM KCI. The reaction volume was set to 50 uL. At each specific reaction time point, the reaction mixtures were quenched by adding 250 HL of methanol. The reactions were vortexed and centrifuged. Supernatant was collected and then analysed by reverse phase HPLC. The new pe generated was collected for ESI-MS or MALDI-TOF-MS analysis directly.\n\n[0099] Bioinformatic Analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
