One example embodiment of the invention has provided a 12x12 coupled oscillator array chip, which occupies a 2 mmx1.7 mm area, and can operate between 643 GHz and 689 GHz (6.9%) and radiate a peak power of 9.1 dBm with 3.32-W power consumption (which implies a 0.245% de-to-THz efficiency at 675 GHz). In that example embodiment, the corresponding lensless EIRP is 30.8 dBm, and the measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset is -90.9 dBc/Hz. In that example embodiment, the beam can be steered from -45\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 in the H-plane. Table I lists the various performance and characteristics of the coherent terahertz radiator array in silicon in one example embodi- ment of the invention. The embodiment provides a high- frequency beam-steerable IC, a silicon-based coherent THz radiator arrays beyond 300 GHz, which can radiate high\n\ncon-\n\nplanes. Therefore, using\n\ndirectivity\n\npower and EIRP with high efficiency.\n\nTABLE I\n\nPerformance or characteristics of a coherent terahertz radiator array in silicon in one embodiment Radiating Beam Frequency Tuning Supply Element Steering \u591a) Range Voltage EIRP & Array Size \u4eba (GHz) oo (wdBm) Differentially 90 675.9 69 12 29.1 fed patch 6749 14 308 antenna 643-689 (12 x 12} DC-to- THz Oof{x aa Ppc Efficiency MHz} Area Pg Area (dBm) (WwW) (%) (dBe/Hz) (mm?)
