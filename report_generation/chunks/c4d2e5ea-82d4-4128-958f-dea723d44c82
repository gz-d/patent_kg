The polymerused was PCL. Tables 10 and 11 show the process conditions used. Table 10 is with no pre-heat treatment, and Table 11 is with pre-heat treatment. All values listed will work with slight variations, such that each value should be interpreted as having the word \u201cabout\u201d in front of it. Additionally, FIG. 4 shows the compressive modulus for the resulting hybrid materials (\u201c_ASCA\u201d indi- cates no pre-heat treatment, and \u201c_pre&ASCA\u201d indicates pre-heat treatment; the amount of Mg is in grams) FIG. 6 shows fluorescent photos after 1 day and after 3 days using enhanced eGFPOB culture by incorporating 0.1 g ASCA- treated 45 um magnesium beads as an example. The photos suggest that the hybrid material of the subject invention is compatible with the growth of osteoblasts.\n\nIt should be understood that the examples and embodi- ments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and. that various modifications or changes in light thereof will suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application.", "type": "Document"}}
