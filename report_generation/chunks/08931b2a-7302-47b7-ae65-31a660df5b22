It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments and with various modi- fications that are suited to the particular use contemplated.\n\nThe apparatuses and the methods in accordance to embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented using computing devices, computer processors, or electronic cir- cuitries and other programmable logic devices configured or programmed according to the teachings of the present dis- closure. Computer instructions or software codes running in the computing devices, computer processors, or program- mable logic devices can readily be prepared by practitioners skilled in the software or electronic art based on the teach- ings of the present disclosure.\n\nAccordingly, at the data recording state or stand-by state (i.e., State 1 or 2), the transmission enabling signal V_En has a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d. At the data transmission state (i.e., State 3), the transmission enabling signal V_En has a high-level value representing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d.", "type": "Document"}}
