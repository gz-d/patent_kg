Accordingly, the primary grain engineering of the present invention does not change the layered framework and stoi- chiometric chemistry from the view of long-range coher- ence. Notably, the lattice parameters of PGE-NCM811, extracted from Rietveld refinements of the XRD pattern, are smaller than those of the pristine sample (Table 1). This further proves the higher valence of nickel ions (with a smaller ion-radius) derived from their oxidation, which will enable the Jahn-Teller monoclinic distortion in the PGE-\n\nNCM811.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTarget materials a-axis (A) c-axis (A) v (AS) Pristine- 2.87145 (1) 14.19623 (4) 101.369 (1) NCM811 PGE- 2.86961 (0) 14.18983 (6) 101.194 (1) NCMBI11\n\nGradient Electronic States in Grain Boundaries of PGE-NCM811\n\n[0043]\n\nThe effects of synthetic oxidation on the electronic", "type": "Document"}}
