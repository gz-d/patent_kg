The patch 106A is cen- trally-fed. The patch 106A is connected centrally with the feed probe 112 so as to be connected with a 50Q radial microstrip line 110A of the microstrip line network 110. The radial microstrip line 110A is elongated and has a width W,,,. The radial microstrip line 110A has a first end (near the center of the second substrate layer 104B) connected with the feed probe 112 and a second end terminating at the edge of the second substrate layer 104B for connection with an external probe or connector (the second end provides a TM port). The radially extending portions of the patch 104A are short-circuited. They each have a width of W,,. The end-to- end length (passing through the circular portion) of diametri- cally opposed radial extending portions is 2L,,. The radially extending portions are spaced apart angularly and evenly with the same angular separation. The radially extending portions is each connected with a via 114 (i.e., via hole) at the radia substrate -outer ends. The vias 114 extend through the first 104A with the 108.\n\n[0047] A prototype has been fabricated based on the design of FIGS. 1A to 1D with these parameters. FIGS. 2A and 2B shows the top view and the bottom view of the substrate assembly of the prototype. The top view shows the feeding network pattern; the bottom view shows the microstrip line network pattern.", "type": "Document"}}
