The diode rectifier may be a standard diode or a voltage doubler.\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention the diode rectifier and the capacitor are formed as part of the battery charging circuit.\n\nPreferably there may be provided a secondary energy receiving element comprising a second coil formed in a plane parallel to the soft magnetic sheet and wherein the second coil is connected in parallel with the first coil. This second coil may be formed ona printed circuit board which may be fixed to said soft magnetic sheet.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment the energy receiving element may further comprise a second coil formed as a spiral in a plane parallel to the soft magnetic sheet and wherein the second coil is connected in parallel with the first coil. This second coil may be formed on a printed circuit board which may be fixed to the soft magnetic sheet.\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention the energy receiv- element may comprise a coil formed on a printed circuit\n\nA BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying in which:", "type": "Document"}}
