RI-qPCR quantitative enrichment is performed by using DANCR in two different regions and MALAT1 in two different regions. GAPDH is used as an internal control in the experiment. Data is expressed as mean+SD, n=3; ** indicates p<0.01 using the unpaired Student\u2019s t test. The upper right panel shows the abundance of Ezrin in the input sample and in the immunoprecipitation, followed by West- ern blotting using Ezrin antibody or IgG.\n\n[0098] FIG. 124 shows the identification of the MALAT1- related proteome associated with CARPID. The volcano plot shows the enrichment of MALAT1 related proteins in HEK293T cells. The x-axis represents the log 2 transforma- tion value of the protein level fold change in the CARPID results of all three groups of XIST gRNAs in compared with the control. The y-axis shows the negative logarithmic converted p-value (non-parametric rank product test). Sig- nificantly enriched proteins are marked with orange dots.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0099] The technical solutions of the present invention are now described in detail below for a better understanding of the technical features, objectives, and advantageous effects of the present invention, but they should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the present invention.
