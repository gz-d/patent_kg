Moreover, pixels are illuminated by different incident intensities and those with larger illumina- tion intensities have larger contributions to the near-field focusing. Therefore, priority may be given to reduce the phase variation of those elements with large illumination intensities. A fitness function targeting the total phase vari- ance of the whole metalens aperture is thus constructed, which can be mathematically written as\n\n(6)\n\nwhere w,,,, is a weighting factor related to the illumination intensity of the mn\u201d dielectric post of Metalens #2, which is practically obtained by extracting the incident amplitude distribution on the plane of Metalens #2. Var(@ ,,,) is the variance of the required transmission phase vector (\u4e5f mn= (nm? s Pan s+ \u00ab+s Pym). The required transmission phase depends on radii of the foci 7=(r\u2122, rf, 2... r) and reference phases C =(C%, C\u00ae, . . . , C\u00ae). Hence, the variables \u4e86 and C can be optimized to minimize the objec- tive function in (6). In practice, r=0 mm and C=0\u00b0 are chosen to ensure that the focus is at the center when a=90\u00b0 and provide a reference aperture phase distribution to other focusing cases. Considering the complexity and nonconvex- ity of the optimization problem, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is adopted to find the global minima and speed up the\n\n\n\nprocess. The optimized results of and C are listed Table III. The synthesized transmission phase profile of Metalens #2 is the mean of the four desired phase distribu- tions and the result is plotted in FIG. 13(h).\n\n[0051] Details on the PSO for Metalens #2 design", "type": "Document"}}
