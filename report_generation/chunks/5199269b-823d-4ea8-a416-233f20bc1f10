The microscope 100 may provide a vacuum environ- ment in which the components of the microscope 100 are arranged. The microscope 100 includes an electron gun 102 arranged to generate an electron stream. A set of condenser lens 104 (e.g., formed by electromagnetic coils) is arranged to control the focus the electron steam, and a set of electron lens 106 (e.g., formed by electromagnetic coils) downstream of the condenser lens 104 is arranged to further adjust the focus on the electron stream to focus the electron beam on the specimen X placed on a platform 108. A deflector 120 (e.g., formed by electromagnetic coils) may be arranged between the condenser lens 104 and the electron lens 106 to move the electron beam to control a scanning or imaging of the specimen X. A current source (not shown) is connected with the deflector 120 to provide current to operate the deflector 120 hence control the magnetic field generated by the deflector 120 to control the electron beam. The electron beam applied to the specimen X triggers the specimen X to provide a corresponding electron beam, which is then picked up by a detector 110 to generate an image of the specimen X. In this process, the deflector 120 moves the electron beam in X and Y scanning directions in the same plane for\n\n[0018] Determining the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction may include analyzing an image of the specimen produced by the imaging apparatus. Deter- mining the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction may include determining an extent of orthogonal- ity of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction.\n\nIn this third aspect, the predetermined equations include\n\nA-A-B'sin \u7531\n\nB=B'eos 6", "type": "Document"}}
