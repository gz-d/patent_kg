The feed probe may be connected to a center of the\n\nomnidirectional radiation pattern at a second resonant mode\n\npatch . In one example , the patch includes a central circular\n\ndifferent from the first resonant mode . The antenna can be\n\nportion and a plurality of radially extending portions extend\n\nused as a signal transmitter , a signal receiver , or a signal\n\ntransceiver . The substrate assembly may be removably\n\ning from the central circular portion . In one example , the\n\nnumber of radially extending portions is an even number .", "type": "Document"}}
