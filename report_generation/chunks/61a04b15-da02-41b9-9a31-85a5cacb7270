[0136] The two rectangular loop-shaped slots of the same\n\nsubwavelength unit have generally the same shape and size but different orientations. Specifically, one of the slots extend generally along an axis and another one of the slots extend generally along another axis. The two axes are arranged at about 90 degrees. The two rectangular loop- shaped slots may be operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with orthogonal eigen-polarization state (each slot operable to radiate electromagnetic waves with a respective eigen-polarization state). For each of the two rectangular loop-shaped slots, the corresponding two PIN diodes are connected across two opposite slot portions on the opposite long sides of the corresponding slot. In this example, the two PIN diodes of one of the generally rectangular loop-shaped slots is disposed generally along a first axis (which is generally perpendicular to the extension axis of the corre- sponding slot) and the two PIN diodes of another one of the generally rectangular loop-shaped slots is disposed gener- ally along a second axis (which is generally perpendicular to the extension axis of the corresponding slot). The first and\n\nsecond axes\n\nare generally perpendicular. The PIN diodes are controllable by control signals\n\n[0137]", "type": "Document"}}
