The high efficiency characteristic of the ferrite-shielded transformers is attributed to their high input impedance. In the PCB transformer shielded with ferrite plates and conductive sheets, even though a layer of conductive sheet is provided on the surface of each ferrite plate, the eddy current loss in the conductive sheets is negligible as discussed above. The H-field generated from the transformer windings is confined in the ferrite plates. The use of thin conductive sheets is to direct the magnetic field in parallel to the ferrite plates so that the normal component of the magnetic field emitting into the conduc- tive sheet can be suppressed significantly. The energy effi- ciency measurements of the ferrite-shielded transformers with and without conductive sheets confirm that the addition of conductive sheets on the ferrite plates will not cause significant eddy current loss in the conductive sheets and diminish the transformer efficiency. From FIGS. 17 and 18, the energy efficiency of both ferrite-shielded transformers, with and without conductive sheets, can be higher than 90%\n\ntive sheets is an effective way to shield magnetic field generated from PCB transformer. The reduction of magnetic field is 34 dB (2512 times) from simulation result and 28 dB (631 times) from measurement. The SE obtained from the measurement is less than that obtained from the simulated result. The difference mainly comes from the magnetic field emitted from the current carrying leads of the transformer. From FIG. 14, the magnetic field intensity generated from the leads is about 118 dB, which is comparable with the magnetic field generated from the transformer. Therefore, the magnetic field transducer beneath the centre of the transformer also picks up the magnetic field generated from", "type": "Document"}}
