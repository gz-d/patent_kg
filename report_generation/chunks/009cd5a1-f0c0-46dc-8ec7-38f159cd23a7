Specifically, the processor in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention incorporates a soft- ware/hardware co-design of CRYSTALS-Dilithium based on NIST PQC round-3 parameters.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n[0050] With reference to FIG. 1, there is shown an embodiment of a processor 100 for a cryptosystem, com- prising: a hybrid processor architecture including a hardware processor 102, a software processor 104 and an intercon- nection interface 106 arranged to exchange data between the hardware processor 102 and the software processor 104; wherein the hardware processor 102 comprises a plurality of hardware accelerator modules arranged to perform compu- tational tasks including at least one of number theoretic transforms (NTT) computation, arithmetic operations which are more time-consuming when being performed instead by the software processor 104,\n\n[0051] In this embodiment, the hybrid processor includes a software processor 104 such as an ARM processor 104A. embedded with a memory controller for accessing memory devices such as DDR memory 104B for temporary storing data or executable instructions which may be processed by the processor 100. In this example, the DDR memory 104B is included as a component of the software processor 104, it should be appreciated by a skilled person in the art that DDR memory or other memory module may be excluded from the processor, for example by including suitable data transmis- sion interface to provide necessary function to support communication between the ARM processor and the DDR.\n\nmemory.", "type": "Document"}}
