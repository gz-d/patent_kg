The information\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nhandling system 700 may further include one or more disk drives 712 which may encompass solid state drives, hard\n\ndisk drives, optical drives, flash drives, and/or magnetic tape drives. A suitable operating system may be installed in the information handling system 700, e.g., on the disk drive 712 or in the memory unit 704. The memory unit 704 and the disk drive 712 may be operated by the processor 702. The information handling system 700 also preferably includes communication device 710 for establishing one or more communication links (not shown) with one or more other computing devices such as servers, personal computers, terminals, tablets, phones, or other wireless or handheld computing devices. The communication device 710 may be a modem, a Network Interface Card (NIC), an integrated network interface, a radio frequency transceiver, an optical port, an infrared port, a USB connection, or other wired or wireless communication interfaces. The communication links may be wired or wireless for communicating com- mands, instructions, information and/or data. Preferably, the processor 702, the memory unit 704, and optionally the input devices 706, the output devices 708, the communica- tion device 710 and the disk drives 712 are connected with each other through a bus, a Peripheral Component Intercon- nect (PCI) such as PCI Express, a Universal Serial Bus (USB), an optical bus, or other like bus structure. In one embodiment, some of these components may be connected through a network such as the Internet or a cloud computing network. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that the information handling system 700 shown in FIG. 7 is merely exemplary and different information handling systems 700 with different configurations may be applicable in the inven-\n\ntion.", "type": "Document"}}
