However, a parallel architecture may be used to accelerate these computations in hardware. Take the polynomial matrix- vector multiplication shown in FIG. 3 as an example. Let A a kx! polynomial matrix, and a, represent polynomial with length n. b is a polynomial vector, and b, is the polynomial with length n. The polynomial matrix-vector multiplication is divided into two steps. In step I (multipli- cation), each row of the polynomial matrix A is multiplied by the polynomial vector b to get a row of polynomial vector in polynomial matrix C. In step II (addition), the polynomial vectors of each row in matrix C are added correspondingly to obtain the polynomial column vector d. o\n\n[0089] There are two methods to compute the multiplica- tion of step I. In method 1, one row of matrix A is taken and multiplied by the column vector b; In method 2, one column of matrix A is taken and multiplied by one polynomial in the column vector b. Both methods need to transmit kxlxn coefficients of matrix A. However, for vector b, method 1 needs to transmit kxlxn coeflicients, while method 2 only need to transmit Ixn coefficients. In method 2, the polyno- mial b is reused to multiply with the column vector of length k, so the data transmission overhead of vector b is only I/k times of method 1. Therefore, in one example embodiment, the hardware modules for PWM may be designed according to the method 2, which enables a significant reduction in the number of data transfers.\n\n[0090] With reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the point-wise multiplication (PWM) module 102B is arranged to acceler- point-wise multiplication of two polynomials, and arranged to operate according to a PWM finite state transi- tion with following states:\n\nate", "type": "Document"}}
