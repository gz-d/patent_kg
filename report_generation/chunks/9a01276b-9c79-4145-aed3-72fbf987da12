The method includes processing a reference video file and a synthesized video file associated with the reference video file to compare the original video file and the synthesized. video file. The method also includes determining an extent of flicker distortion of the synthesized video file based on the processing.\n\n(22) Filed: Aug. 5, 2019 \u00b0\n\nPublication Classificati \u4eba\n\n(51) Int.
