An electricity generator resembling a transistor and powered by impacting liquid droplets, comprising a glass substrate defining an upwardly facing surface and a down- wardly facing surface, wherein said substrate includes i) a region with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated on the upwardly facing surface and acting as a virtual source and ii) an electrode arranged adjacent said PTFE coated region on the upwardly facing surface and acting as a drain in that the said PTFE coated region and said electrode are positioned on the upwardly facing surface to receive an impacting water droplet acting as a gate, and wherein circuitry of said generator connects said virtual source and said drain via an electrical connection passing the downwardly facing sur- face, and electricity is harvested via said electrical connec- tion.\n\n[0103] 22 Krupenkin, T. & Taylor, J.
