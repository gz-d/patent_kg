This singular electrode triboelectric nano- generator is capable of energy harvesting and electronic sensing. Leveraging the fabric\u2019s triboelectric properties, this nanogenerator showcases a response time between 20 to 30 milliseconds, a recovery time between 20 to 40 milliseconds and an areal power density within the range of 0 to 21.6 WW m 7, underscoring its efficiency in converting mechanical energy from moisture movement into a usable power output. This single-electrode configuration streamlines the design and operation, offering a simplified yet powerful solution for diverse energy-harvesting applications.\n\n[0078] The nanofiber-based electronic textile of the inven- tion has several advantages: the function of directional moisture wicking, conductivity, sensing physiological signal and harvesting biomechanical energy; the conductive coat- ing layer is prepared by electrospraying, which is simple, controllable; the addition of surfactants contributes to the dispersion of conductive functional materials, spraying uni- formity and bonding fastness to the substrate; compared with previous studies, the addition of surfactants can further improve the superhydrophilicity of hydrophilic polymers through intermolecular chemical bonding, without the need for post-treatment.", "type": "Document"}}
