The arrow represents the initiation of step-up time. Further- more, the absolute number of bursts with time in the control group and DKO group is shown in FIG. 4F and FIG. 4G respectively. DKO mice showed an increase in the number of bursts. The initiation of step-up time point was indicated by the arrow. Values represented meant+SEM (n=5-7). *P<0. 05, Student\u2019s t-test.\n\n[0102] EMG signal from the mice was recorded by the data acquisition system. In this example, the signal was streamed over UDP at 1000 Hz to the processor and con- troller FPGA board. The FPGA board analyses the EMG signal to differentiate normal and symptomatic EMG pat- tern. Once a symptomatic pattern is detected, a stimulation signal, particularly a stimulation pulse train will be output from the FPGA and delivered as a DBS to the DCN through the neural electrodes implanted on the mice.\n\n[0103] The neural electrodes implanted in DCN were configured to be simulated by iso-flex stimulus isolator (AMPI, Israel) and 9 channel stimulus generator (Master 9, AMPI, Israel). All stimulations were set at a pulse width of 60 us, pulse amplitude of 100 WA, frequency of 130 Hz for 1 h in an open-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS). For a closed-loop DBS, stimulation was set at 100 A current and 60 hs pulse width.\n\nSynchronization of the EMG and Neuronal Data", "type": "Document"}}
