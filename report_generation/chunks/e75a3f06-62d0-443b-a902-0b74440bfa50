Stain-stress tests were performed after the curing process. The results are shown in FIG. 5A-5C. In phase I, the PDMS is cured at a lower curing temperature, leading to a relatively looser packing of the PDMS network as opposed to that cured at a higher curing temperature. Since the curing time is much shorter than that needed for complete polymerization, PDMS is not completely cross- linked yet at this stage. Therefore, Young\u2019s modulus of the PDMS in Phase I is very low. In Phase II, PDMS is further baked at 150\u00b0 C. for 30 min. In this stage, PDMS becomes fully polymerized, and the baking at high temperature will tighten the PDMS network, leading to higher Young\u2019s modulus, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that\n\n[0096] Arrays of closed loops. An over-exposure photoli- thography was employed for fabricating a large array of closed loops with diverse orientations. For a negative pho- toresist, i.e., SU-8, structures with vertical sides are formed when the recommended exposure dose is used during pho- tolithography. When the SU-8 is overexposed, the tops of the structure expand in horizontal direction. Thus, when the overexposure reaches certain level, the expansion of the tops is so large that the adjacent structures are connected in the tops, forming closed loops.", "type": "Document"}}
