In some embodiments, the first slots of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same shape and/or size. In some embodiments, the second slots of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same orientation. In some embodiments, the second slots of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same shape and/or size. In some embodiments, the first control arrangements of the plurality of subwavelength units have generally the same basic construction. In some embodiments, the second con- trol arrangements of the plurality of subwavelength units have the basic construction.\n\ngenerally\n\nsame\n\n[0020] In some embodiments, the first control arrange- ment comprises at least two control elements operably coupled with the first slot for affecting operation of the first slot and the second control arrangement comprises at least two control elements operably coupled with the second slot for affecting operation of the second slot. The at least two control elements of the first control arrangement and the at least two control elements of the second control arrangement may be controlled by a controller. In one example, the controller may provide a first control signal to control the at least two control elements of the first control arrangement and a second control signal to control the at least two control elements of the second control arrangement.", "type": "Document"}}
