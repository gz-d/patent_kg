The linear spectral unmixing model may be a compensated model that relates photoacoustic signals with oxygen saturation, taking into account errors in the photoacoustic signals (e.g., caused by the Griineisen relaxation effect). For example, the linear spectral unmixing model can be represented by:\n\n-= ET\n\nwhere sO, is the (e.g., compensated) oxygen saturation blood,\n\nthe\n\n_ PsFi 1 Paper ED pig thule Fifas \u201d PF VS 1 4 APeott 4 AP,\n\nP,, P3, and Ps are the first, second, and third amplitudes, F, and F, are optical fluences associated with the first and third laser pulses, Nt is a time delay between the first and second. laser pulses, as well as a time delay between the second and. third laser pulses, A, Tu, and b are coeflicients independent of the flow, hi and hu are the optical absorption coefficients associated with the first and second laser pulses, sy \u201c and &,,\u00b0\" are molar extinction coefficients of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin at the first and third wavelengths.\n\n[0018] In accordance with a second aspect of the inven- tion, there is provided a non-transitory computer readable\n\nin\n\nin\n\nJan. 13, 2022", "type": "Document"}}
