NP460 cells are cultured in a cell culture media comprising 50% complete Eplife medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50% complete Defined Keratinocyte-SFM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomycin. NPC43 cells are cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 uM Y27632 dihydrochloride (Alexis), 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomy- cin.\n\n[0132] Both the cell types are cultivated in an incubator at 37\u00b0 C., saturated humidity and 5% CO, in air. Once the cell population reached ~80% confluence, cell passaging is per- formed by applying 0.25 trypsin-EDTA, centrifuging, and resuspending the cells back in fresh media for the subse- quent incubation.\n\nNucleus Extraction\n\n[0133] The cells are trypsinised using 0.25 trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in cell culture media. The cells are then transferred into a pre-chilled syringe tube, centrifuged, and\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\nthe culture media is removed by aspiration. Hypotonic buffer solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl,) and pipetting are applied, followed by placing the syringe tube in ice for 20 min. Next, 10% NP40 detergent (ThermoFisher Scientific) is added to the cell suspension and mixed at 2500 rpm for 15 seconds to chemically extract the cell nuclei. The sample is further processed lm through cell strainers (STEMCELL Technologies Inc.) with a 37 um pore size to remove larger cell debris. After centrifuging and removing the supernatant, which mostly contained the cytoplasmic fraction, the remaining pellet is resuspended to obtain the nuclei.\n\nFluorescence Staining", "type": "Document"}}
