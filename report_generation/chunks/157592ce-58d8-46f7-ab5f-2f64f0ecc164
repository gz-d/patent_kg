[0149] FIGS. 40 to 43 relate to the universal metasurface\n\nantenna 400 with the inherent direction modulation for the BPSK scheme. Specifically, FIG. 40 illustrates conceptually two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envelopes imparted by the spatiotemporal modulation at the fundamental frequency to generate two high-directivity beams with 180\u00b0 phase difference at the broadside direction for BPSK scheme. The space shift of the two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envel- ops is Ax=A/2. The inset in FIG. 40 shows the required STC matrixes for generating such spatial amplitude envelopes at the fundamental frequency. FIG. 41 shows the phase differ- ence between the two radiating cases as a function of the observation direction @. FIG. 42 illustrates conceptually the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for directly generating BPSK modulated waves at the fundamental fre- uency. In this example, only the target user at the main- beam direction can receive the correct phase variation (information), whereas eavesdroppers at off-angles decode garbled constellations. FIG. 43 shows the theoretical power pattern of the universal metasurface antenna and EVM as a\n\nfunction of the observation direction.\n\nFIGS. 44 to 47 relate to further results\n\n[0150] on physical- ayer security communications using the universal metasur- \u2018ace antenna 400. Specifically, FIGS. 44 and 45 show the measured radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna 400 and the measured decoded constellation dia- grams when the receiver is located in different directions. The main beam direction of the universal metasurface antenna 400 is scanned to 30\u00b0 (FIG. 44) and -30\u00b0 (FIG. 45), respectively. As illustrated, only the receiver in the main beam direction can successfully decode the information from the universal metasurface antenna 400.
