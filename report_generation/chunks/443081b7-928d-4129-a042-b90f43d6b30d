In addition, ground plane 504 of exemplary non-limit\n\ning embodiment of GA 300 can comprise conducting plates\n\n2000, a portion of the incident solar radiation can be con\n\n(e.g., 3 pieces of conducting plates each with a size of\n\nVerted into an electrical potential for use by the communica\n\nLxW). Thus, it can be understood that the area of ground\n\ntions antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.) at 2008. For instance, meth\n\n65\n\nplane 504 is larger than that of ground plane 304 of exemplary\n\nodologies 2000 can further include converting a portion of\n\nnon-limiting embodiment of GA 300 by approximately 50%.\n\nincident solar radiation (e.g., such incident light 322 (522),\n\nUS 8,599,081 B2\n\n15\n\n16\n\netc. with regard to FIGS. 3-6) into an electrical potential (e.g., via the one or more solar cell(s)) for use by the communica- tions antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.).\n\nto the communications antenna 1702 and/or for of the communications antenna 1802 (or components subcomponents thereof).\n\nAs an example, circuitry 1708 can include any of (and any number or combination of) electrical transmission lines, elec- trical storage components, voltage regulators, signal condi- tioners, Wilkinson power dividers 1400, switches, relays, and other electrical components suitable for converting, storing, and transporting the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) 1706. Accordingly, the electrical potential created by the one or more solar cell(s) (e.g., one or more solar cell(s) 302, one or more solar cell(s) 502, etc.) in methodolo- gies 1900 can be used to operate any suitable portion of the communications antenna and/or associated or related sys- tems.", "type": "Document"}}
