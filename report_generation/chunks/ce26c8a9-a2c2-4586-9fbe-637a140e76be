The primary induction unit comprises an array of primary transformer windings to provide a substantially uniform magnetic flux distribution over said planar surface.\n\n(57)\n\nThe winding connections of the array may be serial, parallel or both and multiple overlapping layers may be used. The individual spiral windings may be circular, square or hexagonal.\n\nprimary transformer winding array EMI Shield(Ferrite sheet) EMI Shield(Copper sheet) Primary electronic inductive system\n\nLOL68EC AD\n\nAt least one drawing originally filed was informal and the print reproduced here is taken from a later filed formal copy.\n\nIf\n\nFIG.1Ga)\n\nMagnitude (dBuV) 00 020 4 \u591a \u4e0b Yimm Xtmm?\n\nFIG.1(b)\n\nSecondary element e.g. a metallic cooking pot primary inductor system with an interface surface 2\n\nFIG.2\n\nprimary transformer winding array EMI Shield(Ferrite sheet) EMI Shield(Copper sheet)\n\n344\n\nX(mm)\n\nFIG.5(b) |\n\nFig.6(a)\n\nEnergy coupled region\n\nHigh- frequency AC power source Secondary load\n\nprimary windings in parallel", "type": "Document"}}
