Internal bone fracture fixations, spinal deformity corrections and total joint replacements are commonly seen in orthopaedic procedures in which metallic bioma- terials are usually used to maintain biomechanical integ- rity. However, adhesion and proliferation of microorgan- isms on these implants may induce post-operative mi- crobial infections. In addition, they may result in implant loosening or other serious complications. According to R.O. Darouiche in \"Treatment of Infections Associated with Surgical Implants\" (The New England Journal of Medicine 2004;350(14):1422-1429), two to five percent of the patients receiving orthopaedic procedures may be required to undergo revision surgery to remove or replace the infected implants. In addition to the increase in cost to the public healthcare system, the morbidity and mor- tality rates are undoubtedly increased. [0003] Surface modifications have been proposed to modify the surface properties of biomaterials so as to maintain their bulk mechanical properties after treatment. To reduce bacterial adhesion and proliferation, certain surface treatments such as antibiotic, silver and copper ions loaded surfaces have been studied. The fabrication of the surface treated implants have been carried out by the sol-gel technique, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), immersion and ion im- plantation. Unfortunately, the release rate of those sur- face treatment deposits is difficult to manipulate by using the current technologies. In addition, as shown by S-H.
