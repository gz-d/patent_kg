Atomic force microscope image of ReS, nanoflakes on the sapphire substrate indicated that the ReS, nanoflakes thus formed was indeed in a single-layer structure (data not shown). The wrinkle pattern structure started to appear after the sapphire substrate had been irradiated with UV lights for about 180 seconds (FIG. 8).\n\nExample 3: Effects of UV exposure time or humidity level on the wrinkle pattern of the substrates of Examples 1 or 2\n\n3.1 UV Exposure Time\n\n[0053] The monolayer ReS, flakes grown on mica sub- strate by CVD method as mentioned in Example 1.1 was transferred to SiO>/Si substrate and then was irradiated with ultraviolet lights emitted from two light sources of 254 nm and 185 nm, in which the energy of 185 nm ultraviolet light accounted for 10%, and the ReS, flake was irradiated for 30 s, 90 s, 180 s, 300 s, or 450 s, and the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was recorded. Results are provided in FIG. 9. According to the data depicted in FIG. 9, the PL intensity of ReS, substrate significantly decreased with an increase in the UV exposure time, which indicated changes in the optical property of the monolayer ReS, formed on the mica substrate of Example 1.1.\n\n[0054] Similarly, the PL intensity of ReS, formed on sapphire substrate of Example 2.1 also decreased signifi- cantly with an increase in the UV exposure time, which indicated changes in the optical property of the monolayer ReS, (FIG. 10)\n\n3.2 Humidity Level", "type": "Document"}}
