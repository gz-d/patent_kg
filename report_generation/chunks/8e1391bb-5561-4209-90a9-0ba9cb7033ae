Then an o-ring was placed on the smaller case and pressed against the case. Next, a spring, the assembled stainless steel spacer and sodium disk were placed on the o-ring sequentially, with the sodium disk facing upwards. Afier that, a separator (glass fiber) was placed on top of the sodium disk as centered as possible. 200 nuL of 1M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPFo) in diglyme as the electrolyte was then dropped onto the separator. Next, the BHT-BQ- COF-based cathode obtained in Example 4 was placed on top, with the cast film facing the sodium disk and centered as much as possible with the sodium disk to avoid uneven current densities. Finally the larger case was placed on top and the coin cell was packed with 0.8 kPa pressure.\n\nExample 6\n\nElectrochemical Performance of the Half SIB Coin Cell with the BHT-BQ-COF-Based Cathode\n\n[0077] Coin cells of CR2032 were first assembled in argon-filled glovebox (O2<0.1 ppm, H,Os0.1 ppm). These\n\nan\n\nUS 2024/0079591 Al\n\ncoin cells were used to investigate the electrochemical performance of the half SIB coin cell obtained in Example 5, with Na foil as the counter electrode (Na//BHT-BQ-COF SIB). FIG. 5 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the half SIB coin cell. The CV tests were carried out on a Zahner electrochemical workstation with a voltage range of 0.1 V to 3.5 V and a scan rate of 0.1 mV s~!. As shown in FIG. 5, the broad peak located at 0.1 V to 1.0 V during the first anodic process is attributed to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the electrode surface. The redox peaks located at 2.23/2.13 and 2.82/2.74 demonstrate the reversible redox reaction of BHT-BQ-COF electrode.", "type": "Document"}}
