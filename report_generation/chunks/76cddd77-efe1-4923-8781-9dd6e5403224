The PLGA microneedles coated with different metal layers were soaked in the above- mentioned cell culture medium (1 mL) for 24 h. Meantime, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in a 48-well plate with the density of 10,000 cells per well. Then, the cell culture medium of NIH 3T3 cells was replaced by the soaking solution. The control group was cells cultured in normal culture medium. After 24 hours\u2019 culturing, the cells were stained by ethidium homodimer-1 (0.5 uM) and calcein AM (0.25 uM) according to the instruction of the Live/Dead kit. The fluorescence microscope (Nikon) was applied to image at least three random area of each sample. Furthermore, the amalarBlue assay was also performed to show the cell health condition of NIH 3T3 cells cultured in the soaking medium for 24 h. Specifically, the soaking medium was removed followed by rinsing each well with PBS buffer three times, and 200 pL, 10% of amalarBlue reagent was added to each well. Then, the plate was incubated in an CO, incubator at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 h. 100 wl of the solution in each well was transferred into a 96-well black plate, and the fluorescence intensity was read by a microplate reader (SpectraMax\n\nM65e). These tests were repeated three times for each group.\n\nExample 6 \u4e00 Electric Cells Migration Experiments\n\n[0170]\n\nC2C12 cells was used to evaluate the cell migration", "type": "Document"}}
