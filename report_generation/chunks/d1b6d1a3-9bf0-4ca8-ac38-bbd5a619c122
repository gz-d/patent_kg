In addition, a specific surface pattern (ripple-like pattern) appeared on the titanium surface after it was modified by the oxygen PIII&D. This ripple-like pattern can help reduce bacterial adhesion and attachment. [0030] The antibacterial/antimicrobial properties of the specially treated titanium alloys in accordance with the present invention have been characterized by standard colony forming unit (CFU) counting with Staphylococcus aureus, which is commonly seen in orthopaedic implant- related infection. The Staphylococcus aureus adhered on the metallic surfaces was detached by sonication. The CFU of the detached bacteria suspension is determined by surface plating on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar after being incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hrs. As demonstrated in the graph of Fig. 4, the reduction of bacterial adhesion on treated titanium surfaces is significant after the PIII&D surface treatments in accordance with the present inven- tion. [0031] Antibacterial/antimicrobial properties of the treated titanium surfaces can also be visualized by ap- plying fluorescent microscopy. Figs. 5A-5C show the morphology of adhered bacteria on the untreated and treated titanium alloys. It can be easily observed by com- paring Fig. 5A to Figs. 5B and 5C that the titanium alloy treated with oxygen PIII&D successfully inhibits the ad- hesion of Staphylococcus aureus. [0032] Furthermore, with respect to the biocompatibil- ity of treated titanium alloys in accordance with embod- iments of the present invention, mammalian cell culturing using EGFP-expressing mouse osteoblasts have been conducted and are visualized by applying fluorescent mi- croscopy. Figs. 6A-6C show the morphology of adhered mammalian cells on the untreated and treated titanium alloys. The results revealed that the titanium surfaces treated with 50 Hz and 100 Hz oxygen plasma treatment (Figs. 6B and 6C, respectively) are well tolerated by mammalian cells as compared with", "type": "Document"}}
