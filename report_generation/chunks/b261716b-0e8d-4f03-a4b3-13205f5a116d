The neurostimulation system of claim 1, wherein data acquisition unit is in communication with the neura\u2019 electrode for recording neuronal activity of a subject during gait movement.\n\n[0110] According to the results, as shown in FIG. 7 to FIG. 10, DKO mice showed a statistically significant increase in descent latency in the pole climb test, a decrease in stride length in the walking track test, a decrease in retention time on the rotarod spindle and an increase in transverse latency in the narrow beam walking test, as compared with the control group (p<0.05). Accordingly, the mice in the DKO group were confirmed to have a motor deficit.\n\n4. The neurostimulation system of claim 1, wherein processor generates a gait cycle based on the EMG pattern optionally neuronal activity recorded by the neural electrode.\n\n5. The neurostimulation system of claim 4, wherein the processor compares the gait cycle with pre-set gait cycle data to determine whether the EMG pattern is indicative o the abnormal motor movement.\n\n[0111] After confirmation of the locomotion of the DKO group mice, the mice were subject to continuous DCN stimulation to determine whether the DCN stimulation can help to modulate the abnormal motor behaviour. The DCN stimulation was conducted as described above. In particular, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and connect- ing wire was attached with electrode connector. Mice were allowed to acclimatize in the cage with wire for 15 minutes. DCN was simulated at 100 HA current, 60 hs pulse width, at a frequency of 130 Hz continuously for 1 h.\n\n6. The neurostimulation system of claim 1, wherein acquisition unit communicates with the processor via wireless network.\n\n7. The neurostimulation system of claim 1, wherein processor outputs the stimulation signal to the neural elec- via a stimulus generator.\n\n8. The neurostimulation system of claim 1, wherein suffers from ataxia.", "type": "Document"}}
