The projector screen component and barrier compo- nent also can be associated with a barrier control component that can control (e.g., automatically or dynamically in real time) the barrier component to switch the barrier component tween different display modes (e.g., 2-D mode, 3-D stereo- scopic mode, or 3-D autostereoscopic mode) depending in art on the type of video content being projected or displayed on the projector screen component, to facilitate desirably projecting or displaying the different types of video content on the projector screen component. The combination of the arrier control component, the barrier component, and/or the rojector screen component can form a 3-D screen adapter that can process or adapt different types of video content, including normal 2-D content and enhanced 2-D content, to desirably present normal 2-D content, 3-D stereoscopic con- tent, and/or 3-D autostereoscopic content, depending in part on the type of video content received by the projector screen component from the projector component (e.g., rear-projec- tion video projector system) and information (e.g., optical signals) associated with the video content.", "type": "Document"}}
