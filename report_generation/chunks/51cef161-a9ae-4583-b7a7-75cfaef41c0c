The novel fabrication methods can help control the material degradation process and provide bulk mechanical properties similar to natural bone. In addition, these new materials are highly compatible with cells, whereas related art degradable metallic materials are not.\n\nincluding biodegradable polymers and surface-treated bio- degradable metallic materials, as well as fabrication meth- ods thereof. These novel hybrid materials are able to over- come the problems of conventional biodegradable materials (including magnesium-based materials), such as mis- matched bulk mechanical properties, poor biocompatibility, rapid degradation, and hydrogen gas release upon degrada- tion in orthopedic applications. In addition to the enhance- ment of biocompatibility, with the materials of the subjec- tion invention, the degradation process can be manipulated by controlling the chemistry of polymeric materials and the surface treatment of metallic materials as well as their ratio when forming the hybrid materials. The novel materials and methods of the subject invention have several applications, including but not limited to orthopedic implantation. For example, the novel materials of the subject invention can be used for other medical applications, as well as for non- medical applications such as a substitute for metal and/or", "type": "Document"}}
