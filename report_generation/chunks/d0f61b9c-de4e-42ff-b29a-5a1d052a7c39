As such, a detailed explanation of the original voltage regulator part of the modified buck voltage regulator circuit of FIG. 10 need not be provided in detail here as it will be known to the skilled person.\n\nwhere T, (S)=G, ,\u00a2{S)H(S)[1+G_(S)]+G_(S)G,,,/ gain of the system. (S) is the loop\n\nCompared to the original loop gain G,,{S) H(S) of the original (i.e. non-compensated) voltage regulator 110, the compensator circuit 122 can significantly increase the system bandwidth, reduce the closed-loop output impedance, and. improve the input susceptibility. As the compensator circuit 122 is connected in series with the output capacitor 118, G,,,(S) is a high-pass filter. It will compensate high-frequency disturbances at the output of the voltage regulator 110 and. gives a modified output voltage signal v,' for the voltage regulator 110:\n\nThe compensator circuit 122 is arranged to monitor or sense an output voltage signal v, across the capacitor 118 and to compare the sensed output voltage signal v, to a reference voltage signal Verof the voltage regulator 110. Due to the operation of the capacitor and/or other circuit effects, a ripple voltage signal is often present in the output voltage signal.", "type": "Document"}}
