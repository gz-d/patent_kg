The method 1100 can be implemented by a barrier control component to facilitate controlling switching or selecting of a particular display mode of a plurality of avail- able display modes of a barrier component in relation to presentation of different types of video content on a projector\n\nAt 1202, a control region of a projector screen component can be monitored. The barrier control component can include a sensor component that can monitor the control region of the projector screen component to facilitate detecting optical sig- nals (e.g., optical or light signals or patterns) that can be presented in the control region in relation to presentation of the 2-D video image(s) on the projector screen component.\n\nTurning to FIG. 10, illustrated is\n\na flow diagram of an\n\npresented.\n\nAt 1006, the signal can be embedded in the signal region of\n\nvideo content, as more fully disclosed herein.
