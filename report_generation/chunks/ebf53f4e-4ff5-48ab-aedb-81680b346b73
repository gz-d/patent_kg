Different models and parameters may be applied to achieve the best performance on the medication and treatment recommendations 119. The output medication and treatment recommendations 119 includes drug name, dosage, duration, surgical operations and other clinical treatments for each patient which enable the patient to obtain the best prognostic effect.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n[0042]\n\nFor the LVO prediction module 108, the certain system can provide the\n\nprobability that the patient is an LVO patient by receiving data from data collection module 104. The structured data and image data used in LVO prediction module 108 are derived from data collection module 104. The data in data pre-processing element 112 includes, but is not limited to, stroke patients\u2019 demographics, diagnosis and CT images, all of which are then used as input in the deep learning models 116. The demographics data may contain gender, age, weight, and height etc. Family medical history data, may contain indications of new symptoms or illnesses in a family through mapping of International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) Codes or other standard codes such as ICD-9 code. The CT Brain for brain plain may contain computed tomography images, the Image compression may follow a ratio leveraged to have lossy\n\ncompression, which meaning the quality of the images may affected.\n\n30\n\n[0043] The deep learning models 116 receive input from the data pre-processing element 112.
