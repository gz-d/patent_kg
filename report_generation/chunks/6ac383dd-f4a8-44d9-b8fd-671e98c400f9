Consequently, the properties of Au nanosheets can be readily \u201cdegraded\u201d after thermal heating or irradia- tion by electron beams.\n\n[0005] It was discovered that thermal stability of metallic nanostructures, such as OD nanoparticles and 1D nanorods, could be enhanced via encapsulation with an appropriate \u201cshell\u201d material, such as carbon, silica, and metal oxide. The presence of the shell can hinder the diffusion of surface atoms even at elevated temperatures, therefore isolating the \u201ccore\u201d material for protection. However, fabrication of encapsulated nanoparticles was not straightforward, which usually involved multi-step chemical reactions following physical deposition or electron beam irradiation.\n\n[0006] \u2018Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide an easy and scalable method to fabricate metal nanoparticles encapsulated with a protection layer.\n\nMar. 2, 2023\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\na\n\n[0007] One objective of the present invention is to provide simple yet efficient method for the scalable production crystalline gold (Au) nanoparticles encapsulated by amor- phous carbon.\n\nof", "type": "Document"}}
