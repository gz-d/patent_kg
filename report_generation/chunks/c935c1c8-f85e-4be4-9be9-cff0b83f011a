The ex-situ XRD patterns were collected from the 11-ID-C beamline at Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), with the X-ray wave- length of 0.1173 A. The Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns were performed using Fullprof software. The mor- phology and elemental distribution of the samples were characterized by Helios Nanolab 600i high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) ana- lyzer operating at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The XPS measurements were conducted using an ESCA System PHI 5400 instrument. The electronic conductivity of the samples was measured by a four-point probe volt-ampere method (SANFENG SB 118).\n\nCollection and Analysis of In Situ Synchrotron XRD", "type": "Document"}}
