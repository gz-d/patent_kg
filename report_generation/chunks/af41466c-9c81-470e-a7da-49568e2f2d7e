For the geometry (iii), which is inside the predicted successful CECE region, a crack spontaneously formed in each closed loop of PDMS and the PDMS mold can be further used for replication. Then the FEA simulation was performed to reveal the principal stress distribution driving the cracking formation (FIG. 8B). For the PDMS in Phase I, the tensile stress is measured as ~1 MPa, and the ultimate elongation is ~250%. For the closed loops with Worn=4 hm and W,,,,,=8 pum, q equals to 40% and 80%, respectively, both of which are smaller than 100%. In these cases, the von Mises stress mainly concentrates on the neck instead of the bottom area, and thus, the neck area of the PDMS mold will break first and the residual part will be trapped in the master. For the original templates with Winn 12 um and W,,,,,.=16 um, q equals to 120% and 160%, respectively, both of which greater than 100%, and thus, the bottom region breaks first. Meanwhile, for these cases 1/@p equals to 166.7% and 125%, respectively, both of which are smaller than the ultimate elongation of 250%. Therefore, the PDMS can be fully released from the original templates. The bottom thickness is then adjusted (h=15 pm, 10 tum, 5 pum, and 2 um) while keeping the neck length constant (Wo jum), decreasing the bottom thickness ensures the initial\n\n[0107] Mechanism Study of CECE.", "type": "Document"}}
