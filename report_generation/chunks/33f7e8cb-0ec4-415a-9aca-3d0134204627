The method comprises the steps of: configuring the FPGA device includ- ing assigning the LUTs in each of the slices to operate as the memory element; and assigning the flip-flops in each of the slices to pair up with the LUTs and operate as a plurality of pipeline registers in the memory structure.\n\nmay into m rows and n columns of sub-tables according to the dimensions of D-CAM block, i.e., 64x6. Each row of the partitioned TCAM table consists of 64 rules while each column consists of 6 bits. The mxn sub-tables of TCAM may be mapped into the corresponding D-CAM blocks to form a D-TCAM of size DxW, where D is the depth of TCAM and W is the width of TCAM. In the example population operation as shown below, variable \u2018t\u2019 represents the corresponding sub-table of TCAM mapping to D-CAM blocks of D-TCAM. Preferably, a total of mxnx64 LUTRAMs are required to implement DxW D-TCAM because each D-CAM block constitutes of 64 LUTRAMs.\n\n[0065] In this embodiment, the flip-flops in the slices are assigned for pipelining. Advantageously, the memory device may be programmed according to the available hardware in FPGA to efficiently utilize the area and hardware resources, and redundantly inferred FFs of the LUT-FF pairs for pipelining.\n\n[0066] By exploiting the LUT-FF pair nature of the hard- ware resources inside FPGAs, the available hardware resources may be efficiently utilized. Preferably, these redundant flip-flops may be assigned as pipeline registers which combine with the LUT in the slices to form a pipelining memory structure, and improved the throughput of the TCAM design.\n\n[0074] Operation 1 Populating Operation (DxW TCAM)", "type": "Document"}}
