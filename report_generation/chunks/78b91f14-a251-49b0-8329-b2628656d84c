In an aspect, to facilitate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, a switch of the first pair of switches, switch 102 and/or switch 108, can be turned on (e.g., placed in or transitioned to an on state) when the voltage across the particular switch is forward-biased, and a switch of the sec- ond pair of switches, switch 106 and/or switch 104, can be turned off (e.g., placed in or transitioned to an off state) when. the switch current is reversed (e.g., similar to diode current reverse recovery). Thus, to facilitate emulating the turn-on and turn-off conditions of a diode, there can be at least one current-controlled self-driven (CCSD) switch (e.g., switch 106, switch 108) in each of current path of the circuit of the synchronous rectifier (e.g., the equivalent diode-bridge cir- cuit). For instance, in system 100, switch 106 and switch 108 can be CCSD switches that each can be respectively con- trolled by sensing the current through such switch and can be turned or switched to the off state whenever the current sensed across such switch is reversed. The combined actions of the switch (e.g., MOSFET) and its body diode can provide such diode functions as more fully disclosed herein. In an aspect, it can be desirable for each current path to contain at least one CCSD switch to ensure automatic turn off of the switch at desired switching times, wherein, for example, the CCSD switch can emulate a diode turning off after current reverse recovery. In another aspect, switch 102 and switch 104 can be voltage-controlled self-driven (VCSD) switches that each can be turned to the on state when such switch is forward-biased in the same way as when the bridge is connected to a pure resistive load. With a current sensing circuitry, a VCSD switch does not have the emulated diode turn-off mechanism. However, it can be lower in cost when compared", "type": "Document"}}
