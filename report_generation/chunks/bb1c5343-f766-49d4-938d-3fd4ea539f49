The resul ts in FIG. 3B show that the intact ZIKV virus (encircled in the figure) was detectable on the surface of virus infected cells pretreated with or without berbamine, whereas the intact ZIKV virus were highly concentrated at the surface of virus infected cells pretreated with berbamine, not the control cells, after cells were incubated at warm medium. Accordingly, these data dem- onstrate that berbamine have inhibitory effect against the entry of ZIKV or JEV into host cells.\n\nE6 berbamine\n\n[0084] The inventors further tested three analogues berbamine including isotetrandrine, fangchinoline, and E6 berbamine to see if they have anti-infection effect against the flavivirus particularly JEV and ZIKV.\n\n[0085] As shown in FIGS. 4A to 4C, it was found isotetrandrine significantly inhibited both JEV and ZIKV infections of host cells. Referring to FIG. 7C, the EC50 isotetrandrine against JEV in A549 cells is around 12\n\n[0086] As shown in FIGS. 5A to 5C, it was found fangchinoline significantly inhibited both JEV and ZIKV infections of host cells. Referring to FIG. 8C, the EC50 fangchinoline against JEV in A549 cells is around 11\n\n[0087] As shown in FIG. 6A, it was found that E6-ber- bamme markedly inhibited the infection of JEV or ZIKV as manifested by strong inhibition of JEV-NSI and ZIKV- Envelope protein expression in host cells treated with E6-berbamine.", "type": "Document"}}
