The gold film is deposited to a thickness of approximately 10-60 nm During the deposition, the temperature on the substrate should be kept less than 100\u00b0 C. to avoid the degradation of PVA substrate;\n\n[0063] Step Tv \u4e00 the substrate with PVA-gold film was immersed into deionized water at room temperature for 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of metal film. Due to polymer surface buckling-induced exfoliation, organic- gold nanosheets can delaminate from the substrate sponta- neously and form 2D freestanding organic-gold nanosheet. That is, a portion of the PVA substrate accompanies the gold nanosheet to form the composite organic-gold nanosheet. As will be discussed in further detail below deposition of Au onto PVA can lead to the formation of a subsurface Au-\n\nis\n\nMar. 2, 2023\n\norganic layer and even partial carbonization of the PVA.
