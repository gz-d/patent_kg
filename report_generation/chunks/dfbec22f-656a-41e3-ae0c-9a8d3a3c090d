Finally, apply BP optimization to tune {W,, W,} and {B,, B,}.\n\n[0109] After the source domain learning, conduct the target domain learning according to FIG. 6. {W\", BM} of the i-th WI DNN model are obtained by minimizing J with the fine-tuning set Df. The BP method is applied to produce K DNN based WT models using {W\u2018!, B&H}.\n\n[0117] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.\n\n[0110] \u2018The fine-tuned models then can be used for con- dition monitoring of a wind turbine population. In a pre- ferred embodiment of the invention, e.g. to monitor the condition of the i-th WT, the real-time SCADA data of the said WT will be fed into its DNN model to compute RE, which can be seen as an indicator of wind turbine health status. Let R, denote the RE at time t. We can use the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart to do condition monitoring. The control variable z, can be computed by\n\n[0118] Any reference to prior art contained herein is not taken as an admission that the information is common knowledge, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n1.
