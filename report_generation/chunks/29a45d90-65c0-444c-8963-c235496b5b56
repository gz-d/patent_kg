The PV cells are forward-biased and configured to emit light in near-infra-red (NIR) spectrum due to the electroluminescent effect. Where there are connection issues, for example, a PV cell is cracked, or there are any damages blocking the electrical current from passing through a particular area of the PV cell, only that particular area of the PV cell does not emit NIR light. The bypass diode is reverse-biased and therefore not interfering with the inspection process.\n\nFIG. 4 shows a simplified setup for inspection of a PV system including one or more PV modules (or devices) 101. As shown in FIG. 4, a NIR camera 200 is used to capture the NIR light emitted from the PV devices 101 which are forward-biased. The principle of electroluminescence is based on electrical current being fed back to the PV devices 101, such that the PV devices 101 convert part of the energy into NIR light that is emitted into environment. Therefore, each of the PV devices 101 can be used as an opto-electronic device for transmitting optical signals by modulating the electrical current signals passing therethrough.\n\nReferring to a voltage-current characteristic for a generic PV device as shown in FIG. 5, when the PV device is forward-biased to achieve the electroluminescent effect, the current I,,,\u00a2 is negative, Disregarding the current direction, the PV effect causes a change in voltage under all operating circumstance, A) in generative mode, B), C) and D) in diagnosis mode.\n\nTherefore, a wireless optical communication channel can implemented by utilizing measurable changes in voltage and current caused by PV effect (change in voltage) and driving the PV device in generative or diagnostic mode (change in current direction).\n\nbe", "type": "Document"}}
