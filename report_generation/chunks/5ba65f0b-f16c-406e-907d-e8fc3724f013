In addition, the compensated out- put signal v, is received as an input to the controller stage 116 and used in a comparison to the reference voltage signal Ver to derive the control variable for controlling the voltage regu- lator 110 to track the reference voltage signal Ver Conse- quently, the dual effects of using the compensation signal to counter the ripple voltage signal in the output voltage signal and using the compensation signal as an input to the controller stage 116 for determining the control signal enables the out- put voltage signal of the voltage regulator 110 to quickly and. stably converge to the level of the voltage reference signal", "type": "Document"}}
