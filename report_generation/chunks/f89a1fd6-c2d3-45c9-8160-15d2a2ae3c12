As the demand for sustainable and renewable energy is ever increasing, the pursuit of new strategies to achieve efficient electricity generation from green and recyclable sources such as rain- drops has received increasing attention. In spite of extensive progress, efliciently harvesting the hydrodynamic energy of droplets remains challenging. For example, to date, the output power density of liquid/solid based triboelectric nano-generator (TENG) is less than 1 W/m? owing to the limitation imposed by the interfacial effect, as characterized by the charge generation and transfer occurring at the solid/liquid or liquid/liquid interfaces. Thus, the present invention timely to provide new approaches that fundamen- the limitation of the interfacial effect.\n\n[0050] FIG. 10 is a graph showing stability of the charges on PTFE under various humidity; in which when kept under a humidity of 40 RH % for 30 days, the charges on PTFE are still quite stable and there is no pronounced decay. With the increase in the humidity, there is a relatively large deterio- ration in the amount of measured charges.\n\n[0051] FIG. 11 is a graph showing a capacitor charged by a TIDE-G. The capacitor has a 10 uF in a typical full-wave rectifier (Inset) can be charged to 3 V, 7.5 V, 11 V, 15.4 V under continuous water droplet impinging with a frequency of 3 Hz, 8 Hz, 15 Hz, and 30 Hz, respectively. These result shows that the electricity energy generated from TIED-G can be enhanced by increasing the frequency of droplet impinging.\n\n[0052] FIG. 12 is a graph showing comparison of the maximum spreading area A,,,. on the PTFE surface loaded with or without suflicient charges, respectively.", "type": "Document"}}
