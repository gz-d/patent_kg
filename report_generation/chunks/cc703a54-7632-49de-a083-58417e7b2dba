Therefore, when the normal component of the H-field inside the ferrite plate is not sufficiently suppressed (e.g. when the ferrite plate is not thick enough), the H-field emitted from the surface of the ferrite plates can be enor- mous. FIG. 5 shows the magnetic field intensity vector plot of the transformer shielded with ferrite plates. The primary is excited with a 3A 3 MHz current source and the secondary is left open. The size of the arrows indicates the magnitude of the magnetic field intensity in dB A/m. FIG. 5 shows that the normal component of the H-field inside the ferrite plate is not suppressed adequately and so the H-field emitted from the ferrite plate to the free space is very high.\n\nFIG. 16 shows measured magnetic field intensity transformer in accordance with an embodiment of invention and in 20Q load condition,\n\nFIG. 17 plots the energy efficiency of various PCB transformers in 100Q load condition, and\n\nFIG. 18 plots the energy efficiency of various PCB transformers in 10082/100 pF load condition.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nIn accordance with the present invention, the ferrite shielded transformer of the prior art shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 can be modified to improve the magnetic field shielding effectiveness by providing a conductive sheet (for example of copper or aluminum) on the surface of each ferrite plate as shown in FIGS. 3(a) and (b). As an example, the modified transformer and the ferrite-shielded transformer are of the same dimensions as shown in Table I.
