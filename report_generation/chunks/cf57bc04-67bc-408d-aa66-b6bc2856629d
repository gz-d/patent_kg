The output charge measured from TIDE-G (in red) is ~59 nC, which is ~760 folds higher than that of the TENG device (please see right portion of the figure).\n\n[0044] FIGS. 8a to 8d include a photographic image, schematic diagrams and graphs concerning a control experi- performed based on TENG in which:\n\n[0033] FIGS. 4a to 4d include schematic diagrams and a graph showing working mechanism of TIDE-G, in which:\n\n[0034] FIG. 4a is a schematic diagram showing the work- ing mechanism of boosted electricity generation from TIDE- G. The PTFE carries sufficient charges either through con- tinuous droplet impinging or by ion-injection and there exists an electric field (E,) within it. After that, in each cycle, at the beginning of the droplet spreading (i, ii), almost no positive charges in the spreading droplet are transported to the PTFE/water interface owing to the presence of E, and hence there is no electricity generation. In contrast, when the PTFE and drain are connected by the spreading droplet (iii), the higher potential on the drain electrode over the PTFE leads to the building of an additional electric field E, within the droplet, thereby transforming the original random motion of ions into a directional flow, with positive and negative ions towards the PTFE surface and drain electrode,\n\n[0045] FIG. 8a is an optical image showing the as-fabri- TENG device.\n\nFIG. 86 is a schematic drawing showing detailed mechanism of the device.\n\n[0047] FIG. 8c is a graph showing variation of voltage output from TENG as a result of continuous droplet imping- ing. Inset shows the time-dependent variation of voltage generated from a single droplet impinging.", "type": "Document"}}
