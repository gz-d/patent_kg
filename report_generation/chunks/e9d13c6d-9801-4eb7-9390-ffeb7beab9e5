White nodes indicate pro- teins recognized only in a group of gRNAs. The pink nodes represent the proteins recognized in two groups of gRNAs. A line is connected between two proteins evaluated as interaction (STRING interaction scorez0.40). The width of the line is proportional to the STRING interaction score.\n\n[0059] FIG. 3c shows the proteome associated with MALAT1 identified by CARPID. The volcano plot shows the enrichment of MALAT1 related proteins in HEK293T cells. The x-axis represents the log 2 conversion of the protein level fold change in the CARPID combined with the two groups of MALATI1 gRNA in compared with the control. The y-axis shows the negative logarithmic con- verted p-value (non-parametric rank product test). Signifi- cantly enriched proteins are marked with orange dots.\n\n[0060] FIG. 3d shows the MALAT1 protein interaction network identified by CARPID. White nodes indicate pro- teins recognized in a group of gRNAs. The pink nodes represent proteins recognized in two groups of gRNAs. A line is connected between two proteins evaluated as inter- action (STRING interaction scorez0.40). The width of the line is proportional to the STRING interaction score.\n\n[0061] FIG. 3e shows the comparison of CARPID results between different IncRNAs. The Venn diagram illustrates unique and specific RBP between each two of the three IncRNAs (XIST, DANCR, and MALAT1).\n\nthe\n\n[0062] FIGS. 4a to 4e are the optimized schematic dia- grams of CARPID, wherein:\n\n[0063] FIG. 4a shows the position of the three groups gRNA on XIST. Different colors indicate different gRNA groups. Note that the interval between the two individua gRNAs in each group is approximately 15 nt.", "type": "Document"}}
