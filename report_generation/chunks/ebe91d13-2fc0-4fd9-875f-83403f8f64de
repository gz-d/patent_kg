Since \u4e2d sz=-2rmtyT the initial phase of the extracted propagating wave can be tuned from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 by altering the reference time shift t,_, (the phase shift for the 1\u00b0 meta-atom) while fixing the time dt,(x)/ox (FIG. 7).\n\nenable\n\ngradient\n\n[0160] The universal metasurface antenna 400 also enable amplitude control of EM waves. The power distribution of the harmonic frequencies generally depends on the coding context of the time sequence. The amplitude of the extracted propagating wave can be tuned by varying the duty cycle t of the rectangular time sequence (FIG. 8).\n\nThe universal metasurface antenna 400 also enable\n\n[0161]\n\npolarization control of EM waves. In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 can generate arbitrary polarizations by applying independent STC matrixes to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to vary the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the extracted u- and v-polarized com- ponents. In one example, six representative polarizations (|x ) sly), td) 1). ILCP) (left-hand circular polarization), and IRCP) (right-hand circular polarization)) are provided as examples to show the polarization controllability (FIG. 9). The corresponding required STC matrixes are provided in FIGS. 51 and 52.\n\n[0162] The universal metasurface antenna 400 can also independently manipulate all of the properties of the radi- ated propagating wave without shifting the frequency. In one example, the time-average effect of the spatiotemporal modulation is leveraged to form an equivalent sinusoidal amplitude distribution at the fundamental frequency (FIGS. 28 to 33). In this manner, the n=-1 space harmonic becomes\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\na\n\nfast wave. It converts to propagating wave, the wave properties of which can be independently controlled by 1-bit space-time modulation (FIGS. 28 to 33). Further details related to this aspect will be provided below.\n\nthe", "type": "Document"}}
