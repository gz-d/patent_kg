The first control arrangement and the second control arrangement may each be respectively controllable by a controller. In some examples, each sub- wavelength unit may be selectively operable in two or more of the following operation states: (1) the first and second slots are both in radiating state, (2) the first slot is in radiating state whereas the second slot is in non-radiating state, (3) the first slot is in non-radiating state whereas the second slot is in radiating state, and (4) the first and second slots are both in non-radiating state.\n\n[0016] In some embodiments, the first slot and the second slot may have generally the same shape and/or size. In some embodiments, the first slot and the second slot have different orientations. In some embodiments, the first slot and the second slot are both shaped as a loop. For example, the loop may be generally elliptical, generally obround, generally oblong, generally oval, generally triangular, generally rect- angular (e.g., squared), generally polygonal, etc.\n\n[0017] In some embodiments, the first slot (e.g., the loop) extends generally along a first axis and the second slot (e.g., the loop) extends generally along a second axis. The first axis and the second axis may be arranged at a non-zero angle (i.e., not parallel). In some examples, the first axis and the second axis may be arranged at about 90 degrees.", "type": "Document"}}
