Note that the other compositions of the present invention may also be formed using these techniques. The precursors of the pristine NCM811 and PGE-NCM811 were prepared accord- ing to the co-precipitation method described above. An aqueous solution of NiSO,.6H,O, CoSO,.7H,O and MnSO,.5H,O (cationic ratio of Ni:Co:Mn=8:1:1) was pumped into a continuously stirred tank reactor (2 L, 600 rpm) under N, atmosphere. Simultaneously, an amount of NaOH and NH;.H,O solutions selected to maintain the constant pH of 11.2 and ensure homogeneous deposition of transition metals was employed. For the preparation of the PGE-NCM811 material, in particular, an optimized amount of added into the solution oxidant.\n\nKMnO,, was\n\nas\n\n[0032] The precipitated precursor powders were obtained through washing, filtering and drying in a vacuum oven for 6 hours. Finally, the NCM811 materials were prepared by thoroughly mixing the precipitated precursor with LiOH.
