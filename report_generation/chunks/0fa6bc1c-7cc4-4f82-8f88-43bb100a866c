The patch antenna has relatively low profile.\n\n[0016] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip network further comprises one or more parasitic patches operably connected with the patch. The one or more parasitic patches may be spaced apart from the patch. The one or more parasitic patches may comprise two parasitic patches arranged at opposite sides of the patch. The two parasitic patches may be slotted patches each having one or more slots. In one example, the slot is rectangular. The two parasitic patches may be equally spaced apart from the patch and symmetrically disposed about the patch.\n\n[0006] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the absorp- filter is a band-stop filter for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy.\n\n[0007] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the microstrip antenna includes a substrate, a ground plane arranged a first face of the substrate, and a microstrip network arranged on a second, opposite face of the substrate. The microstrip antenna may include further layers or com- ponents. The absorptive filter includes a filter element at least partly arranged inside the substrate. Preferably, the filter element is arranged substantially completely inside the substrate.\n\n[0017] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch antenna has a coaxial feed that extends through the substrate and connects with the patch. In one example, the coaxial feed is connected at one end of the patch and the filter element is connected at another end of the patch. The coaxial feed may extend perpendicular to the face of the substrate.\n\n[0008] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the filter element comprises a resistor. The resistor may be a chip resistor.", "type": "Document"}}
