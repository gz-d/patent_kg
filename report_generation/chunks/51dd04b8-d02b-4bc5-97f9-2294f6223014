In other words, the first oscillator has a tran- sistor arrangement and the second oscillator has a (i.e., another) transistor arrangement. In some embodiments, the transistor arrangement comprises: a first transistor with a gate terminal, a source terminal, and a drain terminal, and a second transistor with a gate terminal, a source terminal, and a drain terminal. The first transistor and the second transistor are operably coupled to operate in phase.\n\n[0013] The first transistor and the second transistor may each respectively be a solid-state electronic device such as a silicon-based solid-state electronic device. For example, the first transistor and the second transistor may each be a field effect transistor (FET). The first transistor and the second transistor may each respectively be arranged (e.g., controlled) to selectively operate in an active region, a cut-off region, and a triode region for facilitating generation of the third harmonic power.\n\n[0014] Insome embodiments, the gate terminal of the first transistor and the gate terminal of the second transistor are electrically connected with each other.\n\n[0015] In some embodiments, the source terminal of the first transistor and the source terminal of the second tran- sistor are electrically connected with each other.\n\n[0016] Insome embodiments, the gate terminal of the first transistor and the gate terminal of the second transistor are electrically connected with the even-mode-shorted coupler.", "type": "Document"}}
