In particular, the bonding site is where the reaction of the amide group of the PAAm chains and the amide groups of MBAA to occur. The MBAA may act as an anchor to bridge the PAAm chains and as a stress buffer center to dissipate mechanical energy and homogenize the PAAm structure.", "type": "Document"}}
