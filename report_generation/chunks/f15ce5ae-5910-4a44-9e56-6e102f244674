It can be observed from FIGS. 22-23 that for both E- and H-planes, the co-polarized fields 2206 (2306) are at least 15 dB stronger than the cross- polarized fields 2208 (2308) in the boresight direction (0=0\u00b0) as could be expected for a flat ground plane case.\n\nThus, at 2006, a portion of the reflected communications signal can be collected, for example, by an antenna element associated with the communications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.) as described above regarding FIGS. 7-8 and 18. For instance, methodologies 2000 can include collecting a por- tion of the reflected communications signal by at least one antenna element (e.g., antenna 706, such as a horn antenna) associated with the communications antenna (e.g., GA 700, etc.). In a further aspect of methodologies 2000, collecting a portion of the reflected communications signal can include collecting a portion of the reflected communications signal by the one or more antenna element(s) located proximate to a focus of a parabolic reflector structure of the reflector, as further described above regarding FIGS. 7-8 and 18.", "type": "Document"}}
