Furthermore, there is a great need to develop anticancer and antibacterial agents with both controllable activation properties as well as tumor-specific targeting. The need further exists for platinum complexes that may effec- tively overcome drug resistance through a distinct and controllable mechanism of action. The need further exists for photoactivatable complexes that may transform to strong\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\noxidants to oxidize survival-related intracellular biomol- ecules and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxide, etc. to disrupt intracellular redox balance to cancer cells or bacteria.\n\nkill\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0008] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a platinum(IV) complex of Formula I.\n\n[0009] where X, X\u2019, Y, Y', and Z are each independently an electron donor ligand, R,~R, are each independently a functional group, L is the linker unit, and n is selected from the group of 0, a positive charge, and a negative charge.\n\n[0010] An embodiment of the present invention relates to various methods for manufacturing embodiments of the platinum(IV) complex herein. An embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of treating cancer, a tumor, or an infection in a subject comprising the steps of adminis- tering to the subject an effective dose of the platinum(IV) complex herein, and administering to the subject near- infrared radiation (NIR). An embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition contain- ing the platinum(IV) complex described herein.", "type": "Document"}}
