In some embodiments, the processor is further configured to cluster or summarize HMMs into single groups using a Variational Hierarchical Expectation Maximization algorithm, wherein the HMMs are clustered according to their probability distributions. In other embodiment the processor 1s further configured to assimilate external user-entered data to associate certain eye movement patterns with certain external task criteria or cognitive state criteria.\n\nIn further embodiments, the processor is configured to determine the number of fixations of eye movements. Advantageously, from the eye movement pattern and fixation probability distributions, the systems of the instant invention can calculate a probability of an individual being ln a certain cognitive state.\n\nIn some specific embodiments, the system of the invention can be used to infer an individual\u2019s preference for a certain choice based on the eye movement patterns.\n\nIn some embodiments, the system of the invention can be used to determine an individual\u2019s cognitive style based on the eye movement patterns of the individual. In specific embodiments, the processor of the system is configured to calculate a log likelihood of a eye movement pattern and assign a certain cognitive style to the measured eye movement pattern if it matches the eye movement pattern of a representative group of individuals having said cognitive style.", "type": "Document"}}
