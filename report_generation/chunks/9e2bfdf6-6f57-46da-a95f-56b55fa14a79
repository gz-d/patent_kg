The demographics data may contain gender, age, weight, height, etc. The family medical history data may contain indications of new symptoms or illnesses in a family through mapping of International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) Codes or other standard codes such as the ICD-9 code. The laboratory result data includes the results from chemical pathology test, haematology test, immunology test, microbiology, test, and virology test. Due to the different testing methods and equipment, the detection unit of the sample needs to be unified in the process of data summarizing and pre-\n\n10\n\nprocessing.\n\n15\n\n[0039] The machine learning and deep learning model 114 is configured to\n\ncommunicate with the ICD-9 prediction model data pre-processing element 110. The machine learning and deep learning models 114 include, but are not limited to, one or more of RF classifier, AdaBoost, ExtraTree classifier, XGBoost classifier, and DNN or CNN models. Applying different models and parameters is required to achieve the best performance and output to provide accurate stroke subtype classification 118. The output result is the specific subtype of stroke which corresponds to a particular ICD-9\n\ncode.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n[0040] The treatment decision module 107 is configured to generate medication and", "type": "Document"}}
