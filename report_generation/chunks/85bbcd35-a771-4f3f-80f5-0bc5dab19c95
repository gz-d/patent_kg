The normal 2-D content can be presented as an output by the barrier component 108 for viewing by a viewer. If, for example, the video content is enhanced 2-D content that can be converted to 3-D stereoscopic content, the selected barrier pattern mode (and selected barrier pattern) can be a stereoscopic-type bar- rier pattern mode, wherein the barrier pattern can comprise or be in the form of repeated columns of regularly (e.g., evenly) spaced vertical strips to facilitate display of the two respective views that make up the 3-D image to the viewer; and the enhanced 2-D content (e.g., stereoscopically enhanced 2-D content) can be passed through the stereoscopic-type barrier pattern to convert the enhanced 2-D content to 3-D stereo- scopic content, wherein the barrier component 108 using the stereoscopic-type barrier pattern can direct each illuminating pixel of the visual image to proceed along a direction that can correspond to the view of the 3-D image scene such view represents. In an aspect, the 3-D stereoscopic content, which can comprise 2 views (e.g., two 2-D views) that make up the 3-D image, can be presented as an output by the barrier", "type": "Document"}}
