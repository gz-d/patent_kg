Such windings may be considered ina general sense to lie in a plane even though they will never- theless have a defined thickness even if it is small. However the invention may also be applied to embodiments where the thickness or height of the winding becomes more significant and the term planar may not apply so readily.\n\nfirst primary planar winding 7 that as in FIG. 8A surrounds the charging surface, but further includes a second spiral primary planar winding 8 that is located within an area defined by the first and principal primary winding. Preferably the second auxiliary winding is located generally concentri- cally with the principal winding so that the center of the spiral of the auxiliary winding is located in the center of the princi- pal primary winding where the voltage sag is at its most extreme.\n\naspects present described and depicted herein, alternative aspects may be effected by those skilled in the art to accomplish the same objectives. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such alternative aspects as fall within the true and of the invention.", "type": "Document"}}
