Preferably it is a weighted SSD, for example given by the equation\n\nss= > Yr ailag FP.\n\nSteps 640, 650, 660 and 670 may be carried out in parallel for each of the i,j values. In step 690 the rate distortion is calcu- lated from the SSD, which was computed in step 680, and the number of bits required to entropy encode the block, which was noted in step 660. The rate distortion may for example be calculated according to the equation Jp,-SSD+A-R; where Jap is the rate distortion, SSD is the sum of squared differ- ences calculated in step 680, A is a Lagrange multiplier and R is the number of bits required to entropy encode the block.\n\nFIG. 11 illustrates a method of encoding video or image data according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In step 700 an area is defined in the video or image data. In step 710 one or more blocks (e.g. macroblocks) are defined in the area of image or video data.
