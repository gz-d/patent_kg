For example, in some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units may be operable to manipulate or control two or more of these five properties at the same time.\n\n[0011] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to independently manipulate or control at least two of amplitude, phase, polarization, fre- quency, and momentum of electromagnetic waves. In other words, in some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to manipulate or control two or more of these five properties independently.\n\n[0012] In some embodiments, each of the plurality of subwavelength units is selectively operable in (e.g., con- trolled to selectively operate in) a first operation state and a second operation state, to facilitate manipulation or control of the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Each of the plurality of subwavelength units may or may not be selectively operable in one or more other operation states. In some embodiments, the first operation state comprises a radiating state in which the corresponding subwavelength unit radi- ates electromagnetic waves and the second operation state comprises a non-radiating state in which the corresponding subwavelength unit does not radiate electromagnetic waves. In some embodiments, the first operation state comprises a first radiating state and the second operation state comprises a second radiating state different from the first radiating state. For example, the first and second radiating states may correspond to different extents of radiation of electromag- netic waves.", "type": "Document"}}
