As shown in FIG. 5A, the PC membrane 202 that is successfully deposited with the gold nano-layer 204 may have a plurality of grain-like structures 502 substantially uniformly distributed on the membrane, resulting in a rough surface.\n\n[0070] The method may then proceed to step 402 where the gold-coated membrane is modified with a coupling agent 206. In this example, the coupling agent is MCH. The coupling agent may be deposited on the gold nano-layer 204 by spin coating. For example, a solution containing a predetermined amount of MCH may be spin coated on the gold nano-layer. The sulfhydryl group of MCH may then\n\n[0076] The PC membrane 608 is modified with a plurality oligo-RNA for capturing the antigens of gastric cancer sample solution.
