After viewing the right side, the participants rarely looked back at the left side (12% probability). This suggested that participants performed a quick scan of the two sides during the exploration period.\n\nby\n\nby\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n32\n\nSimilarly, Table 3b above shows that participants in the preference-biased period were biased to remain looking at the to-be-chosen side (77%) more often than to the not- chosen side (67%); furthermore, they were more likely to transition from the not-chosen-side to the chosen side (33%), than vice-versa (23%).", "type": "Document"}}
