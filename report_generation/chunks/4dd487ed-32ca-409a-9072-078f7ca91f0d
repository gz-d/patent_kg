However, the locations of plastic hinges may vary with dif- ferent flexural members. Nevertheless, the ductile compres- sion zone 40 need not coincide exactly with the position of the maximum moment. In fact, the ductile compression zone 40 acts as a fuse in the structural system, and when excessive loading condition occurs, the fuse will be triggered and force the structural system to deform in a (more or less) plastic manner to avoid abrupt reinforcement rupture or concrete crushing.\n\nFIGS. la to 1f show schematic longitudinal and cross sec- of different embodiments of one aspect of the present invention.\n\nFIGS. 2a to 2c show side views of embodiments of second aspect of the invention.\n\nFIGS. 3a and 4 show an elevation detail of tested speci- mens, with FIG. 34 showing the reinforced concrete beam containing a ductile compression mechanism, and FIG. 3a showing the reference beam constructed by a conventional method.\n\n4 shows the load vs. deformation curve for the of the mechanism used in Example 3.", "type": "Document"}}
