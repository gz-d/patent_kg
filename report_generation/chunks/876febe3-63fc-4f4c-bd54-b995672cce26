The cap is\n\nporated by reference in its entirety. In this design, a planar\n\n40\n\nwireless charging platform is proposed upon which devices to\n\narranged to be in contact with the planar charging Surface and\n\nto support the electrical device on the planar charging Surface\n\nbe charged may be placed. Underneath the surface of the\n\ncharging platform there is an array of primary coils that\n\nduring charging of the electrical device, and the secondary\n\nwinding is arranged to be substantially parallel to the planar\n\ngenerate lines of magnetic flux that extend generally perpen\n\ncharging Surface so that lines of magnetic flux extending from\n\ndicular to the surface of the charging platform. A device to be\n\n45\n\nthe planar charging Surface pass Substantially perpendicu\n\ncharged (for example, a mobile phone) is provided with an\n\nlarly through the secondary winding during charging of the\n\nintegral (or external) secondary coil so that when the device is\n\nplaced on the charging Surface, magnetic flux passes through\n\nelectrical device.\n\nthe secondary coil and generates a Voltage therein.
