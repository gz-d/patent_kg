It is important to note that the addition of a thin layer of conductive material can significantly increase the shielding effectiveness as reported in US-2003-095027-A1, US. Pat. No. 6,501,364, and Tang S. C., Hui S. Y. R and. Chung H., \u201cEvaluation of the Shielding Effects on Printed- Circuit-Board Transformers using Ferrite Plates and Copper Sheets,\u201d JEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Vol. 17, No. 6, November 2002, pp. 1080-1088.\n\nchargers a been developed for use with some types of portable electronic equipment such as electric toothbrushes. Inductive chargers have also been proposed in a number of documents such as . Pat. No. 6,356,049, U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,128, U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,249. These inductive chargers, however, use tradi- tional transformer designs with windings wound around fer- rite magnetic cores and the main magnetic flux between the primary winding and secondary winding has to go through the magnetic core materials. Other contactless chargers pro- posed (e.g., Chang-Gyun Kim; Dong-Hyun Seo; Jung-Sik You; Jong-Hu Park; Cho, B. H., \u201cDesign of a contactless battery charger for cellular phone,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Volume: 48, Issue: 6, December 2001 Page(s): 1238-1247) also use magnetic cores as the main structure for the coupled transformer windings. However, these battery chargers do not use a planar structure and each charger is only able to charge one item of electronic equip- ment at time.", "type": "Document"}}
