FIG. 5 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 200 o FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 5 the measured and simulated resonant frequencies are 24.02 GHz and 24.10 GHz respec- tively, whereas the measured and simulated impedance bandwidths are 6.3% (23.36-24.88 GHz) and 5.1% (23.49- 24.72 GHz), respectively. Both the measured and simulated results cover the entire 24-GHz ISM band (24.0-24.25 GHz).\n\n[0056] FIG. 8 shows the measured and simulated reflec- tion coefficients of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7, along with the simulated results of the reference wideband dielectric resonator antenna. It can be seen from FIG. 7 that both the resonant TE,,,* and TEL modes of the dielectric resonator antenna o the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are excited. The measured and simulated impedance bandwidths of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are 38.24% (2.20-3.24 GHz) and 38.53% (2.20-3.25 GH Z) respectively, with good agreement between the measured and simulated bandwidths. The two resonant frequencies of the reference dielectric resonator antenna are almost the same as those of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna o FIG. 7. This means that the integration resonator antenna with the dielectric resonator antenna does not increase the volume of the dual-frequency antenna. the antenna 300 o of the Fabry-Perot", "type": "Document"}}
