The sublaminar wiring provides fixation at various points along the instrumented area and allows the correction forces to distribute along the spine, thereby lowering the possibility of bone fracture and the need for post-operative immobilization. [0005] The C-D spinal instrumentation system, intro- duced by Cotrel and Dubousset, employs a dual rod sys- tem interlinked by a transverse traction device (DTT), and multiple hooks on each rod. The C-D system was intended to improve thoracic lordosis, preserve lumbar lordosis in the sagittal plane, improve correction in the frontal plane, and minimize loss of correction in case of hook migration or fracture at the bone-metal interface.
