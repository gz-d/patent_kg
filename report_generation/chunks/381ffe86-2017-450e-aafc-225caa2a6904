The time interval of time te to time t, can end, for example, when the voltage vacs reaches, or is substantially close to, a zero voltage level.\n\n300 during the time period of time t, to time t,, when the voltage vasca can reach the applicable predefined gate thresh- old switching voltage for switch Ms, the switch Me can begin to conduct at or near time t,. The voltage v,,,, can begin to decrease from a high voltage level. The voltage Vz-3 can continue increasing in voltage. Before the voltage Vapcs reaches the defined threshold switching voltage for the switch Ms to switch to an off state at time ts, switch Ms and switch M, can conduct simultaneously, such as is illustrated in FIG. 3C. Within the time interval of time tb to time ts, the voltage Ves, can drop down in voltage level to the predefined gate threshold switching voltage of the switch 202 (M,), the tim- ing of which can be at least in part controlled by the ratio of the resistance values of resistors Ri (e.g., 5.1 kQ)andR, (e.g., 5.1 kQ). The time interval can end at time t;, when the voltage Vgs, drops in voltage level to at or substantially near a zero\n\nFIG. 31 presents operation of the system 300 during the time period after time t,, the voltage v,, can be at a lower voltage level than -V,. The voltage vz\u00a2g can be clamped to at or near a zero voltage by the p-n junction between the collec- tor and base of the transistor Q,.", "type": "Document"}}
