As it will be described with reference to FIGS. 3 to 9, as the device modelling engine 204 is preferably implemented by use of a machine learning architecture, including a plurality of learning networks, the removal of any zero (null) data, fault data or noise by the pre-processing module is optional, but may improve the ability to train or pattern match within these machine learning processes. This will in turn improve the accuracy of the device modelling engine 204 to acquire the necessary knowledge to perform a suitable pattern matching or classification process in its subsequent processing of the operation information to deter- mine operation conditions of the device.\n\n[0061] As shown in FIG. 1, the operation information of each of the one or more devices is collected by a device conditions gateway 104. The device conditions gateway 104 may be a centralised system arranged to communicate with various sensors that are operating with each of the one more devices to take various measurements relevant to the opera- tion condition of the device. Preferably, an example of a device conditions gateway 104 may include part or all of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system which is used to monitor and control various devices that are in operation. Such devices may include plant, equipment, devices or appliances in various industries or applications. The SCADA system may be implemented to obtain various operation parameters which are specific to the devices that are being monitored and controlled by the SCADA systems.", "type": "Document"}}
