When introducing the stroke assessment system and its modules, the articles \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to mean that there are one or more elements. The terms \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and \u201cfor example\u201d are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be\n\nother elements in addition to the listed elements.\n\n30\n\n[0023]\n\nIn the referenced figures, there are different modules and their function\n\nrealization processes. The various elements in the figures are connected by arrows or\n\nDocket No. UM1104HK00\n\n4\n\nHK 30057394 A\n\n5\n\n10\n\nsurrounded by boxes. This does not mean that the related modules have a geographical\n\nrelationship, but instead the arrows indicate the logical relationship between the boxed content. These connections can be realized by a corresponding application, a piece of code, or commands executed by multiple pieces of code stored in multiple memories. [0024] All or portions of the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented using one or more of specially configured computing devices, computer processors, or electronic circuitries including but not limited to graphics processing units (GPUs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and other programmable logic devices configured or programmed according to the teachings of the present disclosure. Computer instructions or codes running in the computing devices, computer processors, or programmable logic devices can readily be prepared by practitioners skilled in the software or electronic art based on the teachings of the present disclosure. The aforesaid one or more computing devices may include one or more of server computers, personal computers, laptop computers, mobile\n\n15\n\ncomputing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.\n\n20", "type": "Document"}}
