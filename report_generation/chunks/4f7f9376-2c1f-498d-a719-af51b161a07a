FIG. 18 shows the EIS results of the cell of the symmetric all-organic battery with a wide fre- quency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The small R,, in the symmetric BHT-BQ-COF//presodiated BHT-BQ-COF full cell is about 40 ohm, which manifests fast reaction kinetics on the anode and cathode surface and enables excellent rate performance.\n\n1.
