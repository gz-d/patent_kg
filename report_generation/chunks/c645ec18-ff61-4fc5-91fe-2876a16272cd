The Rhodamine B-loaded PLGA II microneedle patch is then inserted into an agarose gel with a parafilm layer. The gel becomes red after the insertion of PLGA II microneedle patch loaded with Rhodamine B after 5 days while the control sample is still white. The insertion holes created by PLGA II with Rhodamine B show a higher florescence intensity (right panel in FIG. 4A) compared with that of the agar inserted by pure PLGA II microneedle patch (left panel in FIG. 4A). The selected area is further quantified to display the fluorescence distribution of Rhodamine B released from PLGA II microneedle tips (FIG. 4B), and the fluorescence intensity of the whole area indicates that Rhodamine B is successfully released from PLGA II microneedle tips. The drug release profile is further tested on rat tissue with PLGA I/Rho and PLGA II/Rho microneedle patches, where the PLGA I microneedles are degraded faster than PLGA II microneedles, resulting in a stronger fluorescence intensity on the muscle samples (FIG. 4C), and there is no obvious\n\nfluorescence on control samples without Rhodamine B.\n\n[0160] In addition, the long-term drug release perfor- mance of the PLGA II microneedle patch is conducted by loading aspirin and ibuprofen, which are two commonly used. drugs in anti-inflammation. Aspirin- and ibuprofen- loaded PLGA microneedle patches are immersed in PBS solution at 37\u00b0 C. for one month. FIG. 4D shows the release profile of aspirin and ibuprofen loaded in the PLGA microneedle patches. The aspirin releases more than 80% while ibuprofen releases around 70% after 15 days, indicat- ing a promising drug delivery performance of the PLGA microneedles.", "type": "Document"}}
