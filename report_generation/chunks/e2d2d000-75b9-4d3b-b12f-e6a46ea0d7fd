For example, it would be desirable to manipulate microagents to perform certain tasks (such as cleaning, repairing, transporting, etc.) in harsh industrial environment that is dangerous for human beings or is difficult to access. As another example, precision targeted therapy is a modern medical treatment that can precisely locate a lesion in a human body and deliver drugs or therapeutic cells to interact with it. The used drugs or cells can identify specific genes, proteins, and environmental characteristics (pH values, temperature, osmotic pressure, etc.) that are involved in the lesion tissue. Using microagents as carriers to deliver these drugs or cells has been commonly recognized as a promising solution, and its feasibility has been verified in recent years. Microagents can be small particles in the range of a few microns or less, which can protect the drug from degradation and control drug release over a certain period of time, or relatively large microrobots ranging from tens to hundreds of microns, which can deliver cells on the basis of appropriately designed three-dimen- sional (3D) structures to facilitate loading, adhesion, trans- port, and release of functional cells.\n\n[0003] New devices, systems, and methods that assist in advancing technological needs and industrial applications in control of various actuation subject are desirable.\n\nSUMMARY", "type": "Document"}}
