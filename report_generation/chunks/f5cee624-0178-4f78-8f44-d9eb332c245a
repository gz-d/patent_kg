The transmis- sion electron microscope 500 is the same as existing ones (having, among others, condenser lens 502, specimen 504, objective lens 506, projection lens 508, and image plane 510), except that the electron source includes the device 100 of FIG. 1 (only tip shown, for simplicity) and a pulsed laser source 50 operably connected to the device 100. The device 100 may be placed in an electric field that assist generation of electrons or electron beams from the tip. The electron source with the pulsed laser source 50 and the device 100 may be arranged, like the other components of the micro- scope 500, in a vacuum environment. In this embodiment, the laser source injects laser beams or pulses into ultra-high vacuum through ultra-high vacuum (e.g., 107'\u00b0 torr) fiber feedthrough and then transmitted from one end of the fiber to the tip of the fiber 100. The laser beams or pulses arriving at the tip excite the electrons, allowing the electrons to be excited to leave the metallic layers, in the form of electron beam pulses. In one application, when femtosecond pulsed laser is used to excite the electrons at the metallic arrange- ment, an ultrafast pulse electron source can be produced. In general, there are two ways to increase electron or electron eam emission: (1) use pulsed laser with shorter wavelength as they can excite electrons to a higher energy level; and (2) use material with low work function to reduce the energy barrier. The energy source in this example essentially acts as field emission electron gun, a high brightness electron", "type": "Document"}}
