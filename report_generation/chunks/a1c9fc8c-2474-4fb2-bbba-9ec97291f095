Figure 8A is a titanium alloy implant incorporated with an antibacterial peptide through linker mole- cules such as APTES. Figure 8B is the chemical structure of a linker mole- cule APTES. Figure 8C is the chemical structure of an antibacterial peptide for immobilization on the titanium alloy im- plant. This is an example peptide that is incorporated onto the outermost layer of an implantable metallic surface according to an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 9 is an illustration of the fabrication process of antibacterial layers on the substrate surface with the application of grid. The grid with longitudinal lines is placed to cover the substrate surface (on the left).", "type": "Document"}}
