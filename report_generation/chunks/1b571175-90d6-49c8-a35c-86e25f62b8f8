The energy densities of the AD-battery at -20\u00b0 C. and 80\u00b0 C. were 65% and 108% retention of that at 25\u00b0 C. (FIG. 17). The enhanced battery performance at 80\u00b0 C. was mainly ascribed to the increase of ion transport kinetics in the electrolyte at high temperatures.\n\nmV s7!, the CV curves exhibited similar shapes gradual broaden peaks as a result of polarization.\n\n[0228] The rate performance of the battery at different current densities is illustrated in FIG. 15D. The battery exhibited high discharge capacities of 273, 237, 198, 148, and 114 mA h g 1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 A gl, respectively. After cycling back to 0.1 A g7!, a discharge capacity of 270 mA h g 1 was recovered and maintained afterwards (FIG. 15D). In addition, the Coulombic eflicien- cies of the battery was approaching to 100%. The volumetric energy density of the battery was found to be 26.88 mW h cm ~.", "type": "Document"}}
