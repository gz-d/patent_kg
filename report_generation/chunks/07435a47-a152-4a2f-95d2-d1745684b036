The pre-processing process 404 may include a step of filter out any fault operating data in accordance with records as found in an associated fault log and thus leaving only the data under normal condition. As an example, SCADA parameters, e.g. features for modelling the wind\n\ntions\n\nthe\n\na\n\n[0080] Accordingly, the SCADA data of K WTs 504 are collected 402 and pre-processed 404 through the mentioned process above which in this embodiment, the data 504 can be represented as pb} i=1,2,...,K.
