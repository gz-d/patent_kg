In one exemplary embodiment, the transverse traction members 32 are capable of ad- justing the magnitude of the correction force generated by the second support member 10b. For example, each transverse traction member 32 can provide an independ- ent correction force to reinforce or reduce the value of the constant correction force so that the correction device 1 is capable of providing a constant correction force of a different value than that generated by the second support member 10b. Exemplary transverse traction members 32 can include, but are not limited to, superelastic spring members, adjustable cylinders, internal motors, gear boxes, and the like. [0052] In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 5a or Fig. 5b, one or more braking elements 50 can be provided and formed in various manners to adjust the constant correction force. For example, the braking elements 50 can be attached to any portion of the support member 10 or the anchor members 30 to reduce or ter- minate the correction force applied to correct scoliosis. Exemplary braking elements 50 can include, but are not limited to, wires, threads, hooks, screws, clamps and the", "type": "Document"}}
