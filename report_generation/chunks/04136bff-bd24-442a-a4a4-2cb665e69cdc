The droplet retracts but still keeps in contact with the drain electrode, while the current reverses to a negative value. Insets are the selected snapshots showing droplet dynamics on TIDE-G.\n\n[0040] FIG. 54 shows the variation of the output voltage a function of the number of individual droplet impinging.\n\n[0041] FIG. 5c shows the correlation between the mea- sured output and the measured Q,,,,...", "type": "Document"}}
