Examples of the polar solvent suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, ethylene glycol (EG), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), trifluo- roethanol, hexafluoroisopropanol and the like. Examples of\n\nJan. 11, 2024\n\nthe dispersing agent and/or stabilizer suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, polyvinylpyr- rolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the like. According to preferred embodiments of the present disclo- sure, the bulk alloy of step (a) is dissolved in ethylene glycol containing (PVP (i.e., the dispersing agent). A skilled person in the art may be easily determine the amounts of the polar solvent and dispersing agent needed to dissolve the bulk alloy of step (a) through routine experimentation. In one preferred embodiment, 0.1 g of the bulk alloy is dissolved in 30 mL of ethylene glycol supplemented with 0.5 g of PVP.\n\nThe alloy solution of step (b) is then ultrasonicated\n\n[0053]", "type": "Document"}}
