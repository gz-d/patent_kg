The controller 230 may be connected with an actuator (not shown) operable by the user to provide the input to change the equivalent resistance. Alternatively, the controller may be connected with a detec- tor for detecting one or more properties of the emitted electron beam to change the equivalent resistance.\n\ncompo- nents of electron gun 100 relevant to the understanding of the invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the electron gun 100 includes an electron emission element in the form of a filament 102. The filament 102 is connected to a power supply 104 and acts as a cathode during operation. The power supply 104 is arranged to heat and hence activate the filament 102 to trigger electron beam 50 emission from the filament 102. An electrode 106, with a through hole 106H that allows the electron beam 50 to pass, is arranged downstream of the filament 102 (relative to the emitted electron beam). The electrode 106 is electrically connected with a high potential terminal of another power supply 108 such that the electrode 106 acts as an anode during opera- tion. The electrode 106 provides an electric field that accel- erates the emitted electron beam 50 towards the electrode", "type": "Document"}}
