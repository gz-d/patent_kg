For example, a Tower of London (TOL) test is used to test for measuring executive function, a Flanker Task test 1s used for measuring visual attention, and a Verbal & Visuospatial Two-Back Task test 1s used for measuring working memory. Using these methods of the invention it has been determined that eye movement pattern in scene perception are particularly suited to measure visual attention and executive function. Therefore, in preferred embodiments, the EMHMM with co-clustering method of the invention is used to measure visual attention and executive function ln individuals, where focused eye movement pattern indicates superior visual attention and executive function compared to an explorative eye movement pattern. In further preferred embodiments, the EMHMM with co-clustering method of the invention is used to measure object recognition performance, where an explorative eye movement patterns indicates superior object\n\nwith\n\nrecognition performance compared to a focused eye movements pattern.\n\nIn some embodiments, hierarchical HMMs are provided with at least two layers: a high-level HMM that acts like a switch that captures the transitions between cognitive states and several low-level HMMs that are used to learn the eye movement pattern of a cognitive state.", "type": "Document"}}
