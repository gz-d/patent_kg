The secondary resonant tank allows a rel- atively low switching frequency to be chosen so as to optimize the charging performance such is improved en- ergy efficiency and energy transfer; reduced AC resist- ance and EMI emission. The proposed device can be added to existing battery pack externally or integrated into existing charging protection circuit inside the battery pack. If a voltage doubler is used as the diode rectifier, a high voltage generated for the charging circuit can be higher than that of a standard diode bridge.", "type": "Document"}}
