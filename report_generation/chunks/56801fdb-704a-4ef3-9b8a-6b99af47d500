The capacitor 118 is positioned at an output of the voltage regulator 110 in series with a voltage source 124 of the compensator circuit 122. The capacitor 118 is arranged in parallel with a load impedance \u2018Z, 120 of the voltage regulator. The capacitor 118 may form part ofan LC filter circuit at the output of the voltage regulator 110. The capacitor is a circuit element that stores electrical charge. It is used in the illustrated arrangement to help keep the voltage regulator\u2019s output voltage v, generally constant over time, although an output ripple will usually still be present in the output voltage signal in the absence of any application of a compensation signal from the compensator circuit 122.\n\nThe compensator circuit 122, which may in some examples comprise an active device formed on an integrated circuit \u2018IC\u2019, is arranged to monitor or sense an output voltage signal v, (initially an uncompensated output voltage v,,signal in the absence of any compensation) across the capacitor 118 and to compare the sensed output voltage signal v, to a reference voltage signal v,,,of the voltage regulator 110. The reference voltage signal v,, of the voltage regulator 110 is a target voltage signal to which it is desired to converge the output voltage signal v, of the voltage regulator 110. As such and as shown in FIG. 3a, the reference voltage signal Ver has a constant, fixed value over time, although in some examples the constant value of the reference voltage Viermay be vari- able. However, such variation is not normally dynamic, but occurs at discrete points of time and may be manually imple- mentable.", "type": "Document"}}
