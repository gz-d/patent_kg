As further used herein, the term \u201ccommunication antenna(s)\u201d are intended to refer to an antenna, an antenna substructure, or a subcomponent of an antenna suitable for communication of information over a transmission medium (e.g., a wireless transmission medium), such as for example, for communica- tion of data, voice, video, radio beacons, and so on. As described in the background, local generation of renewable energy for communications systems can provide enhanced efficiency without sacrificing wireless communication sys- tem antenna characteristics. Thus, the disclosed subject mat- ter provides systems, devices, and methodologies for solar\n\na embodiments of suspended patch antennas (SPAs) 100 as described herein. FIG. 2 depicts a top view 200 illustrating further aspects of exemplary implementations of disclosed SPAs. Thus, FIG. 1 depicts a single-element 102 SPA fed by an L-probe 104 connected to a connector 106 (e.g., SMA (SubMiniature version A) connector) and supported by a ground plane 108. As further described below, implementa- tions of exemplary embodiments 100 can be employed in various configurations including disclosed implementations, for example, to provide the dual function characteristics as", "type": "Document"}}
