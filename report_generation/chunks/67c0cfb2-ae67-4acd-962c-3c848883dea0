The parts of the mixing device of FIG. 2 are as follows: a) raw materials trays; b) raw materials transfer pipe; c) valve; d) vertical compressor; e) mixing chamber; f) heat element; g) support rollers; h) horizontal rolling plate; i) user input interface; j) controller; and k) outer most shell. Raw materials are stored in raw materials trays (a) and are ready to be fed into the mixing chamber (e). The raw materials trays (a) are con- nected to the mixing chamber (e) via the raw materials transfer pipes (b). The amount of raw materials to be fed is controlled by the valves (c) situated at the chamber side end of the raw materials transfer pipes (b). All surfaces (except that of the roller plates) which are in contact with raw/hybrid materials are coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (TEF- LON) which is to avoid the sticky hybrid blocking the pipes, trays, and chamber. Surfaces of the horizontal rolling plates (h) are coated with reinforced glass that provides sufficient friction to shear the hybrid materials during rolling. The temperature of the mixing chamber is controlled by a heating system at the outer wall of the mixing chamber. The controller controls all action the\n\nExample 9: 45 um Magnesium Beads", "type": "Document"}}
