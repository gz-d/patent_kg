As explained, this also induces a harmonic voltage with the correct phase, which can boost the output power due to harmonic positive feedback phe- nomenon of a harmonic oscillator. At THz frequency/fre- quencies, the optimum drain-source impedance at 3fo should be reactive to resonate with the parasitic capacitance of the transistor to provide a resistive load. Thus, good impedance matching at 3f, is particular useful, as it can effectively\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nextract the harmonic power as well as boost the output. In one example, the optimum impedance can be determined using the setup in FIG. 10 by performing a harmonic load pull simulation. Under the determined bias and fundamental voltages, the third harmonic drain-source impedance Zz 3f, is swept. The corresponding output power is shown in FIG. 12, which shows third harmonic output power Po_3f, from the transistor under different third harmonic drain- source impedance Z,,,_3f, at 3fo. In this example, the opti- mum Z,, 3f, is about 8+j179 for peak third harmonic output power Po_3f,. Other harmonic impedances shown in FIG. 10 are set to zero for initial optimum Z, 3f, determi- nation and are finally set based on the actual values of the implemented design.", "type": "Document"}}
