Tier 2\n\nTwenty nine agents passed the first tier and were tested in the second tier. General toxicity tests have been carried out. The NOAECs for each agent were then been determined. Among them, there were 6 agents (4 herbs and 2 formulas) that no NOAEC could be determined and thus they were not further tested in the third tier.\n\nTaraboletti, G. and Giavazzi, R. (2004).

Therefore, they were failed in the third tier and no further toxicity test was carried out. Five out of 7 herbs induced. ectopic apoptosis at their NOAECs while the remaining 2 passed the cytotoxicity test. Among these 2, only one exhib- ited antiangiogenic activity and passed organ-specific toxic- ity tests and cardiotoxicity at its NOAEC. Furthermore, 3 out of 5 formulas did not induce ectopic apoptosis at their NOAEC and proceeded to further tests while the remaining 2 failed in the cytotoxicity test. Among the 3 passing the cyto- toxicity test, one failed to induce any change in vasculature at its NOAEC. But there was 1 exhibited anti-angiogenic activ- ity at its NOAEC while there was 1 exhibited pro-angiogenic activity. These 2 formulas had passed the organ-specific tox- icity tests and cardiotoxicity test. Therefore, there were 3 agents, including 1 herb and 2 formulas, that passed all 3 tiers", "type": "Document"}}
