The electron source of claim 8, wherein the energy source includes a pulsed energy source arranged to provide energy pulses to excite the metallic arrangement to emit pulses of electrons or pulses of electron beams.\n\n14. The electron source of claim 13, wherein the energy source includes a pulsed laser source arranged provide laser pulses to excite the metallic arrangement emit pulses of electrons or pulses of electron beams.\n\n[0030] For example, the device for providing electrons can be of different sizes, e.g., in micro- or nano-scale. The optical fiber can take different shape, form, or dimension, provided that it includes a tip where a metallic arrangement is arranged. The metallic arrangement of the device for providing electrons need not be in the form of layer(s). In embodiments in which the metallic arrangement includes layers, the number of layers may vary and the material of different layers can be different. The energy source for exciting the metallic arrangement of the device can take any suitable form, including but not limited to a laser source. Depending on the energy source, the metallic arrangement may be excited to provide electrons or electron beams. The device can be made using different methods as generally encompassed by the method illustrated in FIG. 2. The device can be but not necessarily be made using the system of FIG. 3. The system in FIG. 3 can include a different energy source in place of laser. The clamps need not both be movable, but instead can be movable with respect to each other (one fixed, one movable). The optical fiber can be clamped at only one clamp such that the optical fiber has a free end to be processed to form a tip.\n\n15. The electron source of claim 9, wherein the are femtosecond laser pulses.\n\n16. An electron microscope comprising the device claim 1.\n\n17. The electron microscope of claim 16, wherein the electron microscope is a transmission electron microscope.", "type": "Document"}}
