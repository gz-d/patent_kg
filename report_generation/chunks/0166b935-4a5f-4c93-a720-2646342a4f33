Different from most existing research that adopted the constant level of haptic signal for different users, our pilot study shows that the auricular thermohaptic threshold varies across the feedback locations and the users. With the user-customized thermohaptic sig- nals around the ear, our first study suggested the selection of the ThermEarhook with four TEC modules on each side for further investigation, considering the users\u2019 identification accuracy (averagely 99.3%). We then conduct three follow- up studies to further evaluate users\u2019 perception of spatial thermal patterns with ThermEarhook, and finalize a set of multi-points auricular thermal patterns that can be reliably perceived by the users with the average accuracy of 85.3%. Lastly, we discuss the user-proposed potential applications of the thermal haptic feedback with ThermEarhook, such as gaming, music, navigation, mobile notifications, therapeu- tics, and so on.\n\n[0013] In one aspect, the present invention provides a wearable device to convey notifications to the users with thermal haptic feedback including an earhook shell config- ured to be worn on a user\u2019s outer ear, the earhook shell including a plurality of thermoelectric modules for provid- ing hot and cold stimuli at multiple points on an auricular skin area of the user\u2019s outer ear. A wireless receiver is provided for receiving communication signals from a com- puting device. A power supply electrically communicates with the plurality of thermoelectric modules and the wireless receiver.\n\n[0014] In another aspect, the power supply, the wireless receiver, and the plurality of thermoelectric modules are mounted on a printed circuit board.", "type": "Document"}}
