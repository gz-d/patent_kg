Since different values of momentum K,,, are introduced to different harmonic frequen- cies, the space-time sequence can be designed such that only the harmonic frequency of interest fulfils the momentum- matching condition in free space. In one example, the beam directions of other unwanted harmonics are out of the visible region, hence these harmonics do not contribute to radiation in free space. FIG. 50 shows the theoretical and measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface for m=+1 harmonic up conyersion. The theoretical and mea- sured far-field radiation patterns are similar. This validates the effectiveness of the developed approach for far-field radiation pattern calculation.\n\n[0180] For completeness, further details on the derivation equation (6) is also provided.\n\nof\n\n[0181] The equivalent magnetic polarizability Piw for the meta-atom at the m\u2122 harmonic frequency in equation (6) are derived as follows:\n\ni\u201d\n\n= 1 Pim = Fe fe Pade PM dt ($6) 0 1 2 \u4eba = \u865f \u4e00 = @ Pam de \"Ty -2\n\nas\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\n15\n\n-continued \u4e86 \u4eba | 2 1 ryt, = Po oT, \u5230 = Potysine( rm)\n\nWave Manipulations without Frequency Shifting\n\n[0182] For wave manipulations at the fundamental fre- quency (m=0), the equivalent magnetic polarizability due to spatiotemporal modulations in equation (3) can be simplified as\n\n= 1 fw (8) Pim-0 = \u5143 Pde y Tre Jo", "type": "Document"}}
