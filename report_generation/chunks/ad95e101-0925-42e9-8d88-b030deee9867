As shown in FIG. 3, the interferometric unit 210 may be a typical birefringent inter- ferometer, which contains a broadband birefringent optical crystal 211. The orthogonal birefringent axes 212 of crystal 211 represent the ordinary ray (0-ray, arrow in upwards direc- tion) and extra-ordinary ray (e-ray, dot in the direction per- pendicular to the screen) respectively. The axes 212 are set in accordance with the incoming respective p-polarized beam 301 and s-polarized beam 302 for the birefringent optical path difference to be implemented correctly. For example, prior to traversing the crystal 211, p-polarized beam 301 and s-polar- ized beam 302 have zero optical path difference (OPD) as shown in FIG. 3. With birefringent axes 212 adjusted in line with respective polarized beams, i.e. p-polarized beam corre- sponds to the ordinary ray whereas s-polarized beam corre- sponds to the extra-ordinary ray, the two polarized beams experience different optical paths as they traverse the bire- fringent crystal. After passing the crystal 211, the p-polarized. beam 301 and the s-polarized beam 302 become p-polarized beam 303 and the s-polarized beam 304 with optical path difference (OPD). The retardation between the two polarized. beams 303 and 304 due to birefringent crystal 211 is demon- strated in FIG. 3. The amount of retardation can be controlled by the thickness of the optical crystal 211. The thickness of the optical crystal 211 is designed to introduce a sufficient OPD between the two polarized beams, so that adequate spectral oscillation can be observed for signal analysis. On the other hand, the thickness of the optical crystal 211 is also", "type": "Document"}}
