The compensator circuit 122 is arranged to generate a compensa- tion signal v,,,,,, based on said difference level signal and to apply said compensation signal v,,,,,, to said capacitor 118. The compensation signal v,,,,, is an inverse of the output voltage signal v, minus the reference signal Ver\n\n2) Vo'Vo- GL) FreyMo)\n\nv,! is effectively the output voltage signal together with the inclusion of the amplified signal of the difference between the voltage reference signal and the actual output voltage signal. However, as H(S) is a low-pass filter, it will attenuate the high-frequency signal, such as the switching noise, contained in Ver and v,, and will only respond to the low-frequency variation of v, which is advantageous.\n\nIn the voltage regulator arrangement of FIG. 10, the con- troller stage 116 senses the output voltage v, of the voltage regulator 110, compares it with a reference v,,-of the voltage regulator, receives some system variables such as inductor current, switch voltage, switch current, etc, and uses these to derive a control signal to command a control variable, typi- cally duty cycle, to the PCS 114, so as to regulate v, to converge it to Vien The command variable is applied to a gate driver circuit 140 for changing the duty cycle of a switching device 142.\n\nFIG. 9 illustrates in more detail the typical voltage regula- circuit of FIG. 1. In the following description, like numer- to those already employed to describe the typical voltage of FIG. 1 will be used to denote like parts.", "type": "Document"}}
