The method of claim 10, wherein the adverse effects include death and malformations.\n\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein the malformations are observed as changes on the external morphology of teleost.\n\n13. The method of claim 10, wherein the no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) is calculated in response relation between agents and adverse effects.\n\n3. The method of claim 1, wherein, in the first tier, the vascular system is observed by color staining to observe endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity in vascular endot- helial cells, and in the third tier, the adverse effects at the organ level and cellular level are selected from the group consisting of determining: the amount of dead cells, the amount of cells in different stages of cell cycle, changes in the size and shape of an organ, cardiotoxicity including changes in cardiac output, cardiac rhythm, caudal circulation or any combination thereof to evaluate the safety of said agent.\n\n14. The method of claim 13, wherein test agent exposure least 24 hours.\n\n15. The method of claim 1, wherein step (iii) (a) comprises measuring the three dimensional size and the shape of\n\n16. The method of claim 15, wherein the organs are visu- alized by organ-specific substrates.\n\n17. The method of claim 16, wherein the organ-specific substrates are fluorescent.\n\n18. The method of claim 15, wherein the three dimensional size and shape of the organs are determined quantitatively.\n\n4. The method of claim 1, wherein the teleost are zebrafish.\n\n5.
