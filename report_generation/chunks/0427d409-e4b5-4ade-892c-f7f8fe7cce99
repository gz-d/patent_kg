Therefore, a third layer of a hexagonal winding array can be used to fill up all these remaining valley positions, By placing the central positions (peak mmf positions) of the hexagonal winding patterns of the third layer of the winding array over the remaining valley positions of the two-layer structure, an optimal three-layer structure is formed as shown in Fig.23. Fig.24 highlights the peak mmf positions of the three-layer structure. It can be observed that all central positions and vertices of all hexagonal patterns have peak mmf.\n\nthe surface has uniform mmf distribution, any distance\n\nthat the\n\nIn order to confirm mmf over between any two adjacent peak mmf positions can be considered as illustrated in Fig.25. If the winding patterns are excited in the same manner and polarity so that the mmf generated by cach layer of the winding array are always in the same direction at any moment, the resultant mmf is simply the sum of the mf generated by each layer. Fig.25 shows that the resultant mmy over the distance between any two adjacent peak positions in Fig.25 is equal to 1.0 per unit. This confirms that the proposed three-layer winding array structure can be used to generate highly uniform mmf over the inductive energy transfer surface. When used as a contactless, inductive cnergy transfer surface, this uniform mmf distribution feature ensures that, for a given airgap, a secondary coupling winding can always couple the same amount of magnetic flux regardless of the position of the\n\nsecondary element.\n\nIn another embodiment, the three-layer winding array structure can be constructed as a four- layer, with one of the four layers accommodating the return paths of the spiral windings to the electronic driving circuit.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n14\n\n\u2018a\n\nfarther", "type": "Document"}}
