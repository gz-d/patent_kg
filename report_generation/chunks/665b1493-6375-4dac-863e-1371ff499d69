As the switching frequency of power converter increases, the size of magnetic core can be reduced. When the switching frequency is high enough (e.g. a few Megahertz), the magnetic core can be eliminated. Low-cost coreless PCB transformers for signal and low- power (a few Watts) applications have been proposed by the present inventors in U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 08/018,871 and U.S. Ser. No. 09/316,735 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nFIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a PCB trans- former in accordance with the prior art,\n\nFIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the prior art trans- former of FIG. 1,\n\nFIGS. 3(a) and (6) are exploded perspective and cross- sectional views respectively of a PCB transformer in accor- dance with an embodiment of the present invention,\n\nFIG. 4 shows the R-Z plane of a prior art transformer,\n\nFIG. 5 is a plot of the field intensity vector of a conven- tional PCB transformer,", "type": "Document"}}
