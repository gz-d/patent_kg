The two SHMMs were combined into one for each individual as follows. Preliminary analysis indicated that the exploration periods of the left-selected and right-selected trials were similar. In other words, the eye movements during exploration periods were consistent regardless of which side was selected. Thus, the transition matrices for the exploration period of the left-selected and right- selected models were directly averaged together. For the preference-biased period, the two preferred-side parameters and the two non-preferred-side parameters were averaged, essentially normalizing the right-selected trials into left-selected trials. In order to focus the analyses on the transition between the stimuli during preference decision making, only two Gaussian emissions were used per model, one on each side, for the low-level states (FIGURE 6). For SHMM estimation, one Gaussian centered over each stimulus was initialized, with covariance that covered the stimulus. Thus, it could be considered here that the low-level states of the model were pre-specified (and thus not hidden), since it could be determined with good confidence which stimulus was viewed. The advantage of using Gaussian rather than discrete emissions is that it can be easily extended to analyses that explore more ROIs (Le., more hidden lower-level states) on each stimulus. Two high-level hidden states were used to reflect that the participants would transition from the exploration period to the\n\npreference-biased period during a trial.", "type": "Document"}}
