[0024] An important alternative to the planar winding structures of Figs. 11(a) and 11(b) is shown in Figs.12 (a) and 12(b). A secondary energy receiving element 1200 may be added to the first energy receiving element. In particular, additional spiral windings 1200 can be add- ed (connected in parallel) to the pick-up coil 1207 (i.e. the first winding that encloses the soft magnetic core) by printing one or more spiral windings 1200 on a printed circuit board (PCB) 1202 that is placed on top of the mag- netic sheet 1204. PCB 1202 is placed on the side of the magnetic sheet 1204 that in use would face the primary winding(s). It should also be noted that the PCB 1202 can also be very thin (eg 0.2mm) so the combination of the PCB 1202 and the magnetic sheet 1204 is still very thin. By connecting terminal 1208 of the additional wind- ing to the corresponding terminal 1206 of the first winding, and terminal 1212 of the additional winding to the corre- sponding terminal 1210 of the first winding, the two wind- ings are connected in parallel as shown in Fig.12(b). The extra planar winding(s) can improve the energy pick-up in the secondary module. [0025] It should also be noted that a coil formed on a printed circuit board in addition to acting as a secondary energy receiving element in the above described embod-", "type": "Document"}}
