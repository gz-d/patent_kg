In particular, the coupling agents may be a silane-type coupling agent. The polymer chains of the first polymeric material may be functionalized with a first coupling agent of triethoxy(vinyl)silane (TEOVS); whereas the polymer chains of the third poly- meric material may be functionalized with the second cou- pling agent of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrlate (TMSPMA).\n\n[0174] At the bonding site 220, the first coupling agent 222 or TEOVS and the second coupling agent 224 or TMSPMA may be hydrolysed by any suitable method. The hydrolysed coupling agents 222, 224 may condensate with each other by forming a covalent bond such as a siloxane bond therebetween. As such, any molecules along the poly- mer chain of the first polymeric material and the third polymeric material functionalized with the coupling agents 222, 224 may form a covalent or siloxane bond therebe- tween, thereby allowing the polymeric layer coating on and encapsulating the hydrogel structure.\n\n[0168] Optionally or additionally, the covalently cross- inked structure may be crosslinked with the ionically cross- inked structure through physical interactions such as inter- twining and intercrossing between the polymer chains of the second polymeric material and the third polymeric material. By which the mechanical robustness of the hydrogel may be further increased.", "type": "Document"}}
