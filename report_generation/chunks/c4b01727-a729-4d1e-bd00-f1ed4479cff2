PCB Transformer in Loaded Condition\n\nthe PCB transformer, the opposite magnetic held generated from secondary current cancels out part of the magnetic field setup from the primary. As a result, the resultant magnetic field emitted from the PCB transformer in loaded condition is less than that in no load condition. FIG. 15 shows the simulated magnetic field intensity of the PCB transformer shielded with ferrite plates and conductive sheets in 20Q load condition. From the simulated result, the magnetic field intensity, at R=0 mm and Z=5 mm, is about 4.8 dBA/m, which is much less than that in no load condition (13 dBA/m). FIG. 16 shows the measured magnetic intensity in z-direction. The output of the magnetic field transducer, at 5 mm beneath the centre of the transformer, is about 104\n\nsimple and effective technique of magnetic field shielding for PCB transformers. Performance comparison, including shielding effectiveness and energy efficiency, of the PCB transformers shielded in accordance with embodiments of the invention, conductive sheets and ferrite plates has been accomplished. Both simulation and measurement results show that the use of ferrite plates covered with conductive sheets has the greatest shielding effectiveness (SE) of 34 dB (2512 times) and 28 dB (631 times) respectively, whereas the SE of using only ferrite plates is about 4 dB (2.5 times). Addition of the conductive sheets on the surfaces the ferrite plates does not significantly diminish the transformer energy efficiency. Experimental results show that the energy effi- ciency of both ferrite-shielded transformers can be higher han 90% at megahertz operating frequency. But the planar PCB transformer shielded with both thin ferrite plates and thin copper sheets has a much better electromagnetic com-", "type": "Document"}}
