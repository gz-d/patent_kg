Depth Image Based Flicker Distortion Area Detection\n\n[0102] Since not all the areas in the temporal layer include flicker distortion, a flicker distortion area detection algo- rithm is included in this embodiment to locate the flicker distortion more precisely. In fact, the flicker distortion of synthesized videos usually locates at the object edges, which is mainly caused by the depth temporal inconsistency among frames and misalignment between depth and color videos at the depth edges or discontinuous regions.\n\n1, if, ves, 0, otherwise of\n\nW,(u, v) is element of W,.
