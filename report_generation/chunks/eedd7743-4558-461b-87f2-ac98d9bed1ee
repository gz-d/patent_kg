In this way, an elaborate architecture of a three-dimensional monoclinic functional network has been designed to spread over a secondary particle, which stabilizes the hexagonal structure of primary grains from phase transitions, and also offers an interconnected highway for both ionic and elec- tronic transportations. Accordingly, a high performance of\n\nUS 2022/0115659 Al\n\nenhanced cycling stability and outstanding rate capability has been achieved in the inventive cathode material.\n\n[0025] In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for fabricating a cathode material for use in an energy storage device that involves modifying the morphol- ogy of a precursor by manipulating primary-grain interfaces of the precursor followed by synthesizing the cathode mate- rial using the precursor in a calcining process. The cathode material may have a formula of LiNi,M,..0,, wherein 0.6<x<0.9, and M represents one or more transition metal selected from cobalt, manganese, iron, titanium, zirconium, vanadium and chromium. In one embodiment, M is primar- ily cobalt and manganese with optional small amounts of other transition metal dopants. A minimum alteration of structure, constituents, and morphology are involved the method of the present invention, which ensures industrial applicability without tradeoffs regarding energy density and safety. This method is also non-toxic, low cost, and easy to control, making it applicable to large-scale industrial pro- duction.", "type": "Document"}}
