For example, the alloys may be used to fashion orthopedic implants including replacement joints such as hips, knees, shoulders, elbows, fingers, or for rods, screws, nails, spinal implants and the like used for orthopedic pur- poses. They may also be used to form thin matches useful for making patches, tubing, and devices useful in urologic, car- diac, spinal, cerebrospinal, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary,\n\n14. Oliveira, M.
