A total of 11 lipoylated peptides (KAlip-1 to KAlip-11) were synthesised. The peptide sequences were selected from proteins that have been reported as being lipoylated (PDH, KDH, BCKDH, and GCV) and non-lipoylated proteins (e.g., histone). The pep- tides were synthesized with a standard Fmoc solid phase synthesis approach and characterized by LC-MS. The delipoylation activity was then determined by an HPLC assay. Sirt2 catalysed the removal of the lipoyl group for all the peptides tested, as shown in Table 1. Compared with non-putative peptides, putative lipoylated peptides appeared to be more efficiently hydrolyzed by Sirt2. For example, the delipoylated product of KAlip-1 (derived from histone) after 40 min was determined to be 59%, which is less than that of putative lipoylated substrates such as KAlip-5 and KAlip-6 (derived from PDH). Near absolute delipoylation was observed for KAlip-5 and KAlip-8 within just 15 min, signifying that Sirt2 catalyzed the removal of the lipoyl\n\n[0086] Sirt6 in vitro. The catalytic efliciency of Sirt2 toward the putative lipoylated peptides (KAlip-5, 8, 10) was slightly higher than toward the nonputative H3K9 lipoyl peptide (KAlip-1). Strikingly, the catalytic efficiency of Sirt2 (K,,,/K,,) to delipoylate DLAT K259 of the PDH complex (KAlip-5) is approximately 426-fold higher than that of Sirt4.\n\n[0087] Taken together, these in vitro enzymology demonstrated that Sirt2 is a robust delipoylating enzyme.\n\nExample 7\u2014Sirt2 Removes Klip from Lipoylated DLAT Protein\n\n[0088] An experiment was performed to test whether Sirt2 delipoylates protein substrates.
