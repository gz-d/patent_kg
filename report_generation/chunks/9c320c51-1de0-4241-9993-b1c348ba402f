Thus, eye movements in a visual task may be considered a Markovian stochastic process, which can be better understood using a hidden Markov model (HMM), a type of time-series statistical model in machine learning. More specifically, in this method, HMMs were used to directly\n\nin\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n2\n\nmodel\n\nand hidden\n\nof the\n\neye movement data, states HMMs corresponded to ROIs eye movements. The transition probabilities between hidden states (ROIs) represented the temporal pattern of eye movements between ROIs. To account for individual differences, one HMM was used to model one person\u2019s eye movement pattern in a visual task in terms of both person-specific ROIs and transitions among the ROIs. An individual\u2019s HMM was estimated from the individual\u2019s eye movement data using a variational Bayesian approach that can automatically determine the optimal number of ROIs. In addition, individual HMMs could be clustered according to their similarities (Coviello, Chan, & Lanckriet, 2014) to reveal common patterns. Differences among models could be quantitatively assessed using likelihood measures, that is, by calculating the log-likelihood of data from one model being generated by another model.\n\nof\n\nThus, the EMHMM method was particularly suitable for examining individual differences in eye movement patterns and their associations with other cognitive measures. Also, since HMM is a probabilistic time-series model, it worked well with a limited amount of data (e.g., 20 trials), which is in contrast to deep learning methods that require large amounts of data to train effectively. Thus, the EMHMM approach was especially suitable for psychological research where data availability 1s limited or data collection 1s time consuming.", "type": "Document"}}
