With refer- ence to FIG. 7, the measured and simulated results are in good agreement. The measured maximum realized gain is 7.28 dBi at 5.8 GHz, which is 0.78 dB lower than the simulated peak gain (8.06 dBi) at 5.94 GHz due to experi- mental tolerances. The measured realized antenna gain is higher than 7 dBi from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a measured 1-dB gain bandwidth (gain26.28 dBi) of 5.86% (5.63-5.97 GHz). In the upper stopband, two measured radiation nulls with low antenna gains of around -23.5 dBi, along with a sharp roll-off rate for the upper band-edge, are observed. The measured out-of-band suppression level is more than 20.5 dB in the upper stopband (6.12-6.50 GHz). In the lower stopband (5.00-5.44 GHz), another two radiation nulls are measured at 5.41 GHz and below 5.0 GHz, respectively, leading to a suppression level of more than 17.4 dB. The antenna gain of the reference antenna is also shown in the same figure to highlight the filtering characteristic of the\n\n[0061] It will be appreciated by person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the inven- tion should therefore be considered in all respects as illus- trative, not restrictive.", "type": "Document"}}
