Besides the common channels of information commu- nication through visual and audio techniques, the tactile/ haptic modality is receiving more and more attention. The vibrotactile feedback has been used for variety of applica- tions including navigation and notifications/warnings. Also, the vibrotactile feedback has been tested individually and in combination/comparison with other modalities for notifica- tion on the move. However, sometimes it may be difficult for users to perceive the exact vibration location in the context of multi-point spatial vibrotactile feedback, as the natural turbulence or movements during walking or driving may affect the of vibration.\n\nperception", "type": "Document"}}
