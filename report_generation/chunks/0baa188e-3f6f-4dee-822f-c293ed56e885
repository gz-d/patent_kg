The system 300 can include a projector screen component 302 that can receive visual images 304 from projector component 306. The projector screen component 302 can be associated with a barrier component 308 and barrier control component 310 that can facilitate controlling the presentation (e.g., projection, display) of the visual images 304 to a viewer(s) in response to detecting a signal(s) in a control region 312 of the projector screen component 302. A signal region 314 in a visual image 304 can provide signal (e.g., optical signal) to the control region 312 when the visual image 304 is provided (e.g., projected, presented) to the projector screen component 302 by the projector compo- nent 306. The barrier control component 310 can include sensor component 316 that can include a sensor array 318 and/or solar", "type": "Document"}}
