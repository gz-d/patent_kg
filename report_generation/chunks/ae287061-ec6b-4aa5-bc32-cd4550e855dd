The secondary memory 910 may include, for example, a storage drive 912, which may be a hard disk drive, a solid state drive or a hybrid drive, and/or a removable storage drive 917, which may include a mag- netic tape drive, an optical disk drive, a solid state storage drive (such as a USB flash drive, a flash memory device, a solid state drive or a memory card), or the like. The removable storage drive 917 reads from and/or writes to a removable storage medium 977 in a well-known manner. The removable storage medium 977 may include magnetic tape, optical disk, non-volatile memory storage medium, or the like, which is read by and written to by removable storage drive 917. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), the removable storage medium 977 includes a computer readable storage medium having stored therein computer executable program code instructions and/\n\nor data.\n\n[0107] In an alternative implementation, the secondary memory 910 may additionally or alternatively include other similar means for allowing computer programs or other instructions to be loaded into the computing device 900. Such means can include, for example, a removable storage unit 922 and an interface 950. Examples of a removable storage unit 922 and interface 950 include a program car- tridge and cartridge interface (such as that found in video game console devices), a removable memory chip (such as an EPROM or PROM) and associated socket, a removable solid state storage drive (such as a USB flash drive, a flash memory device, a solid state drive or a memory card), and other removable storage units 922 and interfaces 950 which allow software and data to be transferred from the remov-", "type": "Document"}}
