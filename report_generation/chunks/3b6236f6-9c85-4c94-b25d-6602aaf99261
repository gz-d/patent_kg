By Faraday\u2019s law, an AC voltage will be induced in the secondary winding. In this invention, the two terminals of the secondary resonant tank are connected to a diode rectifier and a capacitor as shown in FIG. 13. The use of this diode rectifier and a smoothing capacitor is important. Firstly, the diode rectifier turns the induced AC voltage in the winding into a rectified DC voltage and the DC capacitor reduces the AC voltage ripple so that a fairly constant DC voltage can be made available for the charging protection circuit. Secondly, the diode rectifier pre- vents any current from flowing into the secondary resonant tank 1400 formed by Lr and Cr when a traditional battery charger is plugged into the charged equipment. This feature can be explained with the use of the block diagram as shown in FIG, 14. As the introduction of the proposed inductive charging device should not affect the use of a traditional power adaptor, it is important that the new circuit should allow the electronic equipment to be charged by both a planar inductive charging platform and a traditional power adaptor. Ifa traditional power adaptor 1402 is plugged into the charg- ing socket of the electronic equipment, the terminals DC+ 1404 and DC- 1406 will be connected to IN+ 1408 and IN- 1410 of the battery pac the charging socket. TI through the mechanical contacts in he presence of the diode rectifier is crucial here because it prevents any current from the tradi- tional power adaptor from flowing into the \u201csecondary wind-\n\nIt should also be noted that a coil formed on a printed circuit board in addition to acting as a secondary energy receiving element in the abovedescribed embodiment, may alternatively serve as a single energy receiving element on its own.", "type": "Document"}}
