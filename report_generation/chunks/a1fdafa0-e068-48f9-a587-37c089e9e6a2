While the subject matter has been described above in the general context of computer-executable instructions of a computer program that runs on a computer and/or computers, those skilled in the art will recognize that the subject disclo- sure also may be implemented in combination with other program modules. Generally, program modules include rou- tines, programs, components, data structures, etc. that per- form particular tasks and/or implement particular abstract ita types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the inventive methods may be practiced with other com- puter system configurations, including single-processor or multiprocessor computer systems, mini-computing devices, mainframe computers, as well as personal computers, hand- held computing devices (e.g., personal digital assistant (PDA), phone), microprocessor-based or programmable con- sumer or industrial electronics, and the like. The illustrated aspects may also be practiced in distributed computing envi- ronments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. However, some, ifnotall aspects of the subject disclosure can practiced on stand-alone computers. In a distributed com- uting environment, modules be located in both fas", "type": "Document"}}
