In an embodiment herein, the linker is selected from the group of a conjugated carbon ring containing structure with the total carbon number less than 26, a Ca.io carbon chain, and a combination thereof; or at least one electron-donating moi- ety.\n\n[0075] In Formula I, n indicates the charge of the complex, and may be zero (0), a positive charge, or a negative charge; zero or a positive charge; or an integer from -2 to 4; zero.\n\nor\n\nor\n\n[0076] \u2018The present invention provides a novel class of platinum(IV) complexes. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that these complexes are photo-oxidants that can be used as drugs and prodrugs; or prodrugs, and effectively activated by near-infrared radiation (NIR) for the treatment of diseases, especially cancer and bacterial infec- tion. Compared with other UV or visible light photoactivat- able drugs and prodrugs, the invented current platinum(IV) complexes may be activated by a low-dose of NIR to release platinum(I]) drugs. It is believed that by using NIR instead of, for example, UV light, to activate the platinum(IV) complexes herein, the treatment and use possesses signifi- cantly increased penetration depth, and/or decreased photo- toxicity. As the present platinum(IV) complexes are strong photo-oxidants, it is believed that they may oxidize biomo- Jecules to further enhance their anticancer and antibacterial efficiency.", "type": "Document"}}
