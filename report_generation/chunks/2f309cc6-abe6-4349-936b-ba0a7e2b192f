That for example, the encapsulation 130 may have the same electrolytic solution as the electrolyte 106 but different polymeric materials.\n\n[0147] The electrolyte 106 may be a polymeric electrolyte disposed between or containing the anode 102 and the cathode 104. Preferably, the polymeric electrolyte 106 may bea hydrogel electrolyte that is viscous enough to be formed into a shape and retain the shape it is formed into. For example, the electrolyte 106 may be formed into any one of an elongated shape, a planar shape, a tubular shape, a ball shape or any suitable shape.\n\n[0148] The hydrogel electrolyte may comprise a polymer matrix including at least two crosslinked structures having at least two polymeric materials. The polymer material(s) may be chemically functionalized so as to form a covalent bond with the encapsulating layer 112, thereby the hydrogel electrolyte may be substantially encapsulated by the encap- sulating layer 112 and preventing water losing from the hydrogel.\n\n[0141] The cathode 104 comprises a substrate 110 with an active material 116 disposed on the substrate. In one example, the substrate 110 may be in similar construction to the anode substrate 108. That is, the substrate 110 comprises aSS mesh. Alternatively the substrate may be a CNT paper, carbon paper, carbon cloth, nickel/copper alloy cloth or steel sheet.", "type": "Document"}}
