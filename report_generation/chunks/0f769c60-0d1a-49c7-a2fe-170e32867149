The waveguide 204 may, e.g., be a substrate integrated wave- guide. In some embodiments, the substrate integrated wave- guide may include: a dielectric substrate, an electrically conductive layer arranged on one side of the dielectric substrate, another electrically conductive layer arranged in (e.g., embedded in) or arranged on (e.g., arrange don another side of) the dielectric substrate, multiple electrically con- ductive elements (vias fences, holes, posts, etc.) arranged in (e.g., extending at least partly through) the dielectric sub- strate and electrically connecting the two electrically con- ductive layers. The electrically conductive layers may each have even or uneven thickness. The dielectric substrate may have one or more layers, each with even or uneven thick- ness. The electrically conductive elements may be disposed in multiple rows (e.g., multiple generally parallel rows).", "type": "Document"}}
