Previously, multi-chain network models have been established for better understanding the 3D stress- strain relationship of the elastic solid rubbers. The most basic theoretical approach is to assume Gaussian statistics, which proposes a three-chain network model. E is deduced to be directly proportional to both the chain density n (i.e.\uff0c the number of chains per unit volume) and the temperature T, as shown by equation E=3nkT, where k is the Boltz- mann\u2019s constant.\n\n[0094] Fabrication of 3D Master Structures\n\n[0095] The replication of several representative hierarchi- cal structures were studied, including a close-loop array with hexagon lattice, a close-loop array with square lattice, an array of split ring, a beaded probe, a helix, an arch, and a bull, as shown in FIG. 3A-3G. These structures resemble to those emerging three-dimensional (3D) microstructures reported recently, and were fabricated by Photo lithography, soft lithography, and two-photon lithography as described below.", "type": "Document"}}
