While\n\nAccording to one preferred embodiment, the invention\n\nprovides a method for the altering Surface composition of a\n\nthe homogeneity of the materials microstructures and the\n\nSurface morphology may alter the anti-corrosion ability of\n\nnickel titanium alloy part to increase biocompatibility, com\n\nprising implanting nitrogen, oxygen or carbon on the Surface\n\nNiTi alloys, there is no doubt that the corrosion resistance and\n\n40\n\nanti-wear properties of the materials must be enhanced before\n\nof the nickel titanium alloy part by plasma immersion ion\n\nthe materials can be widely used clinically, especially as\n\nimplantation, or deposition, or ion beam immersion or\n\northopedic implants with couplings where fretting is\n\nimplantation. The nickel titanium alloy is preferably a shape\n\nexpected.\n\nmemory alloy, and has a nickel content ranging from about\n\nTitanium carbides and nitrides have excellent mechanical\n\n20-80% of nickel and 80-20% of titanium. The Surface\n\n45\n\nand chemical properties, for example, good wear resistance,\n\nimplantation of elements enhances the mechanical properties\n\nof the alloy, Such as hydrophilicity, corrosion and wear resis\n\ninactive with numbers of chemical Substances and outstand\n\ntance. The nickel titanium alloy part can be reduced or\n\ning hardness 11-16. Titanium oxides are known to be fairy\n\ncompatible with living tissues 17-20. They are also inactive\n\nenhanced. In practicing the invention, the plasma immersion\n\nion implantation and deposition or related ion-beam and\n\nto many chemical reactions. In Surface coating industries,\n\n50\n\nplasma-based techniques such as plasma-enhanced vapor\n\nthese elements have been applied to improve the mechanical\n\nphase deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition", "type": "Document"}}
