Preferably, the subject suffers from spinocerebellar ataxia.\n\n[0016] In an embodiment, the processor outputs the stimu- lation signal to the neural electrode continuously until the processor determines that the abnormal motor movement no longer exists.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0017] In another aspect, the present invention pertains to method of modulating an abnormal motor movement of subject by using a neurostimulation system, the method comprising:\n\n[0002] People suffering from neurological disorders may have difficulties in balancing, moving, coordination, speech, logical thinking and the like. Ataxia is one of the neurologi- cal disorders which is typically correlated to neurodegen- eration. People affected by ataxia have problems with coor- dination and balance, for example some may struggle to walk in a straight line or become clumsy. There are various types of ataxia including Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, gluten ataxia, episodic ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxias.\n\n[0018] implanting a EMG electrode in the subject, wherein the EMG electrode is in communication with a data acquisition unit which receives and transmits a EMG signal;\n\n[0019] implanting a neural electrode in a deep cerebel- lar nuclei of the subject;", "type": "Document"}}
