The system 700 can include a capture compo- nent 702 that can capture or generate (e.g., computer generate or simulate) multiple 2-D views of a real or synthetic 3-D scene image for each image of a 3-D scene. Turning briefly to FIG. 8 (along with FIG. 7), which depicts an example system 800 for capturing a real 3-D scene, the system 800 can com- prise a plurality of scene capture devices (e.g., video cam- eras), such as scene capture devices 802, 804, 806, 808, 810, 812, and 814. The respective scene capture devices 802 through 814 can be placed in different positions in relation to the real 3-D scene to provide different visual perspectives of the 3-D scene from different angles. The various different positions of the respective scene capture devices 802 through 814 can correspond to the barrier pattern mode (e.g., associ- ated with an autostereoscopic barrier pattern) to be employed. when reconstructing and presenting the 3-D scene to the viewer, wherein a corresponding barrier pattern can be struc- tured (e.g., partially opaque and having a defined pattern, as more fully disclosed herein) so that it can receive enhanced video information relating to an image of the 3-D scene (e.g., enhanced 2-D content of an image of the 3-D scene) based at least in part on the respective subsets of visual information associated with the real 3-D scene, can process the enhanced. video information to identify the respective 2-D images cap- tured by the respective scene capture devices 802 through 814, and can direct the respective 2-D images to proceed in respective directions that correspond to the respective posi- tions of the respective scene capture devices 802 through 814 when the respective scene capture devices 802 through 814 were capturing the real 3-D scene from their respective per- spectives, as more fully disclosed herein, so that", "type": "Document"}}
