The detector may be an imaging device. The controller may be implemented using one or more of: U, MCU, controllers, logic circuits, Raspberry Pi chip, etc.\n\nThe invention relates to an electron gun and an apparatus incorporating the electron gun.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nElectron guns are devices that can generate a high-energy- density electron beam. These devices are commonly found in cathode ray tubes, vacuum tubes, and scientific appara- tuses including electron microscopes and particle accelera- tors. The electron beam generated has to be precisely controlled to suit particular applications.\n\nin one embodiment of the first aspect, the control element comprises a Wehnelt element arranged around the electron emission element. The Wehnelt element may be in the form a cap or a cylinder with a through hole that allows the emitted electron beam to pass.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nin one embodiment of the first aspect, the electron further comprises a further power supply for activating electron emission element. The further power supply may voltage supply.", "type": "Document"}}
