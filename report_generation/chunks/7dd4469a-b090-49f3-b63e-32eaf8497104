Within the whole focus steering range, the near-field sidelobe levels (SLLs) are all below -14 dB. The focus scan loss, defined as the discrepancy of electric field intensity at the focal point when scanning, is around 4.5 dB. Lenses 1 and 2 are synchronously co-rotated to steer the focus along the azimuthal direction. FIGS. 8(a)-(c) illustrates the orientations of the lenses 1 and 2 and their corresponding simulated and measured power densities on the focal plane at 300 GHz. The focus positions and their corresponding rotation angles are listed in Table II. The focus steering counterclockwise along a circular orbit can be observed from FIG. 8(a)-(c).\n\nTABLE II\n\nFocal positions and rotation angles of the two lenses for focus azimuth steerin: Case Vi Mb2 \u5247 Tt 1 ase 135\u00b0 90\u00b0 8.9 mm 2 90\u00b0 180\u00b0 135\u00b0 8.9 mm 3 135\u00b0 225\u00b0 180\u00b0 8.9 mm 4 180\u00b0 270\u00b0 225\u00b0 8.9 mm 5 225\u00b0 318\u00b0 270\u00b0 8.9 mm\n\n[0039] The focus at different azimuth angles shares a similar focusing performance in terms of near-field SLL, full width at half maximum (FWHM) and power density. Although only five azimuthal steering cases are presented in FIG. 8, the antenna can realize continuous focus azimuthal steering with continuous synchronous co-rotation of the lens pair.\n\n[0040] Changing the separation S of the lenses 1 and steers the focus along the longitudinal direction (z-direc- tion).
