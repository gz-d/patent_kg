The information handling system 700 can be used in the determination of hemoglobin concentration, flow, and oxygen saturation, by processing the photoacoustic signals with the respective models. The information handling system 700 may be partly or com- pletely integrated with the system 200 of FIG. 2 or the photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus 300 of FIG. 2. The information handling system 700 may alternately be an information handling system separate from the system 200 the photoacoustic imaging sensing 300.\n\nor\n\nor\n\napparatus\n\nThe information handling system 700 may have\n\n[0094]", "type": "Document"}}
