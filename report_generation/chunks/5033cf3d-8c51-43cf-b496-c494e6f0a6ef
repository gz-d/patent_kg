FIG. 47 illustrates the measured radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna 400 operating at the m=-1 harmonic frequency, and the measured decoded constella- tion diagrams when the receiver is located in different directions. In this example, the receivers can successfully decode the information outside the main beam.\n\n[0151] FIGS. 48A to 49 illustrate setups for characterizing a prototype of the universal metasurface antenna 400. Spe- cifically, FIGS. 48A and 48B show corresponding schematic and photograph of the measurement setup for measuring radiation pattern of the metasurface antenna 400 prototype. FIG. 49 shows the dual-channel wireless communications link testbed, in which the universal metasurface antenna directly and simultaneously generates two independent modulated waves with different information. Two horn antennas connected to two vector signal analyzers (VSAs) are used to receive and demodulate the signals.
