This basal surface is able to resist the attachment of microor- ganisms and the formation of biofilm. [0020] For the pressurized hydrothermal treatment, functional groups of interest can be incorporated onto the substrate surface as another basal surface to resist microbial adhesion and proliferation. [0021] The second layer next to or on top of the afore- mentioned basal surface can be fabricated and covered by antimicrobial peptides. The antimicrobial peptide coat- ing formed in accordance with the present invention per- forms such that the release of antimicrobial peptide is triggered when the microorganisms start to attach to the surface. In contrast, the conventional release mecha- nism of antibiotics loaded surfaces are subject to the ex- posure to the body fluids, and are therefore uncontrolla- ble. According to an embodiment, the antimicrobial pep-", "type": "Document"}}
