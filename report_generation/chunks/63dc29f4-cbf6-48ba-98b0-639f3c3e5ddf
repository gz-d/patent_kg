Material and Methods\n\na. Egg Collection\n\nZebrafish mate and spawn with the light on. In order to collect eggs, it is necessary to protect the eggs from being eaten by the adults. The egg collection box used is made of acrylic with a metal mesh mounted on top. This is then cov- ered with plastic seaweed so that the adults will mate where the plastic seaweed is, and the eggs that are spawned will fall into the acrylic box. The eggs are to be protected from adult fish consumption with a metal mash. The collection box should be removed after 30 min duration of the light period. The eggs are then to be collected by pouring fish water from the collection box through a fish net. The eggs should be rinsed under running tap water for 30 seconds, then trans- ferred into a 90-mm Petri dish with 15 ml of embryo medium (19.3 mM NaCl, 0.23 mM KCl, 0.13 mM MgSO,-7H,0, 0.2 mM Ca(NO3)>, 1.67 mM Hepes (pH 7.2)). The dish should then be kept in an incubator at 28\u00b0 C.", "type": "Document"}}
