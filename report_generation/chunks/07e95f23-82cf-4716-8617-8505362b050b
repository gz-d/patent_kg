This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the dis- closed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\n\nThis 3-D technology has motivated numerous research works with the ultimate objective of developing different kinds of 3-D commercial products, such as television, photo frame, computer monitors, and toys, with 3-D technology. The concept also can be applied to display larger 3-D images via rear projection. This can be achieved by projecting the integrated images (e.g., integrated 2-D images that can form 3-D images) onto a projector screen which can be overlaid with a parallax barrier or a lenticular lens array.", "type": "Document"}}
