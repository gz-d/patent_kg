The SDGD subsystem can comprise SDGD component 2114, which can be associated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2102; SDGD component 2116, which can be asso- ciated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2104; SDGD component 2118, which can be associ- ated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2106; SDGD component 2120, which can be associated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2108; SDGD component 2122, which can be associated with and can facilitate controlling operation of the switch 2110; and SDGD component 2124, which can be associated with and\n\nThe respective switches 2102, 2104, 2106, 2108, 2110, and 2112, each can include respective body diodes 2128 (for reason of clarity, included but not expressly labeled in FIG. 21, but expressly identified in other figures, including FIG. 25A), 2130 (for reason of clarity, included but not expressly labeled in FIG. 21, but expressly identified in other figures, including FIG. 25A), 2132, 2134, 2136, and 2138. In an aspect, the body diodes 2128, 2130, 2132, 2134, 2136, and 2138 can be structured and can be arranged in the circuit in relation to each other and other components, such that they can inherently function as a bridge-rectifier, as desired, including during initial start-up of the SDSR (e.g., prior to the rectified DC voltage providing at least a portion of the desired power to the switches of the SDSR).", "type": "Document"}}
