The hydrogel 200 may comprise a polymer matrix including at least two crosslinked structures having a second polymeric material and a third polymeric material.\n\n[0164] The second crosslinking agent 210 may be arranged to provide an anti-freezing effect to the electrolyte 106. As shown in FIG. 2B, the second crosslinking agent may further form at least one hydrogen bond with water molecules. In other words, the water molecules are \u201cheld\u201d by the second crosslinking agent, rendering the water mol- ecules more distant from each other. As such, it would be more difficult for the water molecules to get close enough to crystallize (i.e. forming ice) under subzero temperatures, increasing the resistance of the electrolyte to freezing con- ditions.\n\n[0157] In particular, the first polymeric material and the second polymeric materials and/or the third polymeric mate- rial may be chemically functionalized such that the hydrogel 200 and the polymeric layer 201 may be chemically cross- linked with each other.\n\n[0158] In one example, the first polymeric material may be polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) forming an elastomeric layer. The second and the third polymeric material may be polyacrylamide (PAAm) and alginate respectively, which combine and form a hydrogel material that may have an interconnected porous structure and may be used as an electrolyte in a battery or a supercapacitor.", "type": "Document"}}
