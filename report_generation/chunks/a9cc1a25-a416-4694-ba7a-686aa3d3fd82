The following measure- ments of other performance are herein determined by the sample-3. The current-time (I-T) curves show a gradual increasing trend in the current under the correspondingly increased external pressure (FIG. 3C). FIG. 3D exhibits the current-voltage (I-V) curves of the sample-3 with the volt- age sweeping from \u20141.0 to 1.0 V, showing the proportional increasing dependence of the voltage by the current under different pressure. This finding demonstrates a good ohmic contact between the conductive sensing layer and the inter- digital Au electrode, enabling the electronic fabric to dis- tinguish different pressures over a wide range.
