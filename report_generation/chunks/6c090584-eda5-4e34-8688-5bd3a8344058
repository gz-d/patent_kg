As shown in FIG. 1C, three of these amino acid residues, specifically R245, N413 and N419, are located in the recognition lobe and one amino acid residue, R654, is located in the RuvC-II domain.\n\nIn some embodiments, the modified protein includes an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 2 or homologue thereof wherein the modified protein comprising amino acid sequence includes three E782K, N968K, R1015H mutations and a mutation at an N413 position.\n\nIn an embodiment, the modified protein comprising muta- tions at E782, N968, R1015 and N413 positions further includes one or more mutations at the R245, N419 and/or R654 positions. In a particular embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ D NO: 4 or a homologue thereof that includes a mutation at N413, N419, R245, R654, E782, N968 and R1015 posi- tions. In a preferred embodiment, the mutation is a single amino acid substitution. In a most preferred embodiment, the modified protein includes an alanine at the N413 posi- tion, and/or optionally at the N419, R245 and R654 posi- tions.", "type": "Document"}}
