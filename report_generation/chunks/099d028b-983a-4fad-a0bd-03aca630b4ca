After being immersed in water for 120 min, the AD-battery retained approximately 90.8% retention of its initial specific capacity with no appreciable deterioration and continuously powered an elec- tronic watch (FIGS. 22A and 22B). In addition to operating in water, the AD-battery was well operable under various beverages, such as beer, soda and berry juice, ete. (FIG. 22C). These results further confirm that the elastomeric coating retards the mass exchange between the inner organo- hydrogel matrix with the outer environment.\n\n[0234] In addition, the variation of specific capacity with temperature (FIG. 17) indicated that the discharge capacity retentions of the AD-battery at -20\u00b0 C. and 80\u00b0 C. compared\n\n[0240] Freeze-resistant performance and thermal durabil- ity are of paramount importance for practical applications of\n\n5\n\nand\n\nThe real-time influence of\n\nthe elec-\n\ntemperature.\n\nsame experimental\n\nJan. 14 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0013551 A1\n\n14\n\ndifferent mechanical deformations , such as twisting , rolling ,\n\nsolid - state batteries working in harsh environment .
