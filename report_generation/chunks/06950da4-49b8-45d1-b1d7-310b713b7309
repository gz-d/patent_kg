Here, it was assumed that he low-level states were shared among the high-level states (), and thus the number of low- evel states (K) was the same for each high-level state. Consequently, the equivalent standard HMM had S*K augmented hidden states Z,,. The augmented states took a value pair (7,4), where j indicates the high-level state and & indicates the low-level state.
