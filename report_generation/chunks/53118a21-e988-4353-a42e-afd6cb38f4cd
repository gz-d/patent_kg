Similar to the above, the support member 10 can be in a \u201cC\u201d or \u201cS\u201d shape, depending on the sagittal profile of the spine. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be lon- gitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can. be disposed on the deformed spine 2 extending between a proximal vertebra 6 and a distal vertebra 8. The support member 10 can be mounted onto the spine 2 to provide a support for the correction device 1. In an exemplary embodi- ment, such as shown in FIG. 2, the two ends 16 and 18 of the support member 10 can be fixed to the proximal vertebra 6 and the distal vertebra 8. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be secured to multiple sections of the deformed spine 2.\n\nOne or more anchor members 30 can be used to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4. Simi- lar to the above, the anchor members 30 can be activated to lock the support member 10 and the deformed portion 4 during or after the spine surgery, or both. Additionally or alternatively, the activation can be carried out either by a mechanical device, such as a screw driver or by a remote means, such as an electromagnetic heating.", "type": "Document"}}
