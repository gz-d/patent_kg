For example, the Harrington system, introduce: in the early 1950s, employs a distraction rod on the concave side of the deformed spine. The use of the Harrington system and spinal fusion in treating idiopathic scoliosis was found useful for both single and double thoracic contours. However, a loss of lumbar lordosis, or the \u201cflatback\u201d effect, can occur when using the Harrington system along with distraction over the lumbar spine. This effect could be countered by segmental wiring (e.g., sublaminar wiring or wiring of the spinous pro- cess) over the instrumented site to retain the lumbar lordosis. Nevertheless, the Harrington system can have limited contro of sagittal plane correction, limited derotation, and high rate of hook dislodgment in the lumbar spine, encounter distrac- tion rod fracture, and require postoperative external support.", "type": "Document"}}
