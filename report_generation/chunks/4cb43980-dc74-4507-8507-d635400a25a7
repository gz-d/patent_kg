The hydrophilic polymer options include polyacrylonitrile, poly- vinyl alcohol, nylon, or polyethylene glycol, while the surfactant can be selected from sodium dodecyl sulfonate, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate or hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide.\n\n[0075] The electrospinning process is characterized by using a single-needle spinning device, maintaining electro- spinning conditions comprising a voltage range of 20 kV to 25 kV, a syringe pump flow rate of 0.03 mm/min to 0.06 mm/min, and a receiving distance of 10 cm to 15 cm.\n\n[0076] In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, a biomimetic, nanofiber-based, and directional moisture-wicking electronic skin, in which the aforemen- tioned electronic fabric is integral, is provided. The hydro- phobic nanofiber layer is thoughtfully designed to make direct contact with the human skin, enhancing the sensor\u2019s functionality and optimizing its performance in various applications.\n\n[0077] In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator\n\na\n\nis\n\nUS 2024/0260899 Al", "type": "Document"}}
