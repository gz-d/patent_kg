In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem, or at least a desired portion thereof, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In another aspect, the SDGD subsystem can comprise ahigh-side portion, which can include SDGD component 112 and SDGD component 114, and a low-side portion, which can include SDGD component 116 and SDGD component 118, wherein the high-side portion and the low-side portion can be symmetrical. Thus, the synchronous rectifier of system 100 can be a self-driven synchronous rectifier (SDSR), wherein the switches 102, 104, 106, and 108, with the associated SDGD subsystem, can form, emulate, and/or function as a diode bridge, but with significant reduction in conduction loss as compared to conventional diode bridges or synchronous", "type": "Document"}}
