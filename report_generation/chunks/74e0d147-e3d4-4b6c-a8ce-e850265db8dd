The classical schoolbook polynomial multiplication has a complexity of O(n?), while the NTT can reduce it to O(n log n). NTT is generally a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) over an integer field or ring. The NIT used is the DFT over polynomial ring z,[x]/p(x), where z, is the number under modulo q, and (x) is an irreducible polynomial. For NTT, the NTT domain polynomial coefficients @, are calculated by @=2,.\"'am\u201d in z,, where w is the pre-determined twiddle factor. On the other hand, in INTT, the normal\n\ndomain coefficients are computed as a=n 1,9\" \"Go,\n\nWhen directly applying NTT in the polynomial multiplica- tion, it requires n zeros appended to each input, which doubles the length of the inputs and requires additional reduction to the ring R,. To address these issues, the negative wrapped convolution (NWC) method can be explored. By applying NWC in polynomial multiplication, one needs to first perform point-wise multiplications of a, and y\u2018, where y is the square root of \u00ab, then then transform two polynomials a(x) and b(x) into NTT domain to get a(x) and b(x). Next, point-wise multiply these two polynomials and get \u00e9(x). After that, use INTT to transform the results back to normal domain and get the results c(x). Last step is to perform coeflicient-wise multiplication of c and 65 \u4e00\n\n[0073] Based on the analysis results shown above, four hardware modules are designed to accelerate the time- consuming operations in Dilithium. They are the hybrid NTT/AINTT module 102A, point-wise multiplication (PWM) module 102B, point-wise addition (PWA) module 102C, and the SHAKE module 102D. The hybrid NTT/INTT and PWM modules handle the polynomial multiplication com- putation. The PWM and PWA modules are responsible for", "type": "Document"}}
