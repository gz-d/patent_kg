Therefore, in some embodiments one or more features of the computing device 900 may be omitted. Also, in some embodiments, one or more features of the computing device 900 may be com- bined together. Additionally, in some embodiments, one or\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nmore features of the computing device 900 may be split or more component parts.\n\none\n\n[0115] When the computing device 900 is configured to quantify mechanical properties of a cell, the computing system 900 will have a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon an application which when executed causes the computing system 900 to perform steps comprising: receive, from the imaging device, image data of the cell deformed within the microfluidic channel at a first deformation level and a second deformation level different from the first deformation level; determine, based on the image data, parameters associated with the deformed cell at the first deformation level and the second deformation level; calculate, using the parameters, a first elastic modulus of the cell at the first deformation level and a second elastic modulus of the cell at the second deformation level; and calculate, using the first and second elastic moduli, a nuclear modulus of the nucleus and a cytoplasmic modulus of the cytoplasm.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\n3D Nuclear Shapes of NP460 and NPC43 Cells", "type": "Document"}}
