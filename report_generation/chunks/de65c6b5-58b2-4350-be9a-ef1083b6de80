This planar PCB transformer technology has been applied in a range of applications. In 2004, it was used for a contactless battery charger for mobile phones (Choi B., Nho J., Cha H. and Choi 8.:, \u2018Design and implementation of low- profile contactless battery charger using planar printed circuit board windings as energy transfer device\u2019, JEEE Transac- tions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 51, No. 1, February 2004, pp. 140-147). Choi uses one planar winding 400 as a primary charging pad and a separate planar winding 402 as a second- ary winding as shown in FIGS. 4a and 44. FIG. 5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit diagram 500 of this contactless charging system. It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described by Hui and Tang, while the front power stage of the secondary circuit is a standard winding with a diode rectifier that provides the rec-\n\nTwo main problems suffered by the prior art charging of FIG. 5 include:\n\nAnother planar inductive battery charging platform was proposed in WO03/105308. Unlike GB2399225A, the charg- ing platform 200 proposed in WO03/105308 uses a multi- layer planar winding array to generate an AC flux that has almost uniform magnitude over the entire charging surface. The lines of flux 204 of this charging platform flow \u201cperpen- dicularly\u201d in and out of the charging surfaces (FIG. 2). This perpendicular flow of flux is very beneficial because it allows 2 3\n\n(1) The planar winding of the secondary module must be placed directly on top of the planar winding of the pri- mary unit. If it is slightly misplaced, the energy transfer will be seriously hampered.\n\n(2) The use of one spiral planar winding in the secondary module to pick up energy emitted from the primary winding requires the choice of switching frequency to be very high (eg 950 kHz).
