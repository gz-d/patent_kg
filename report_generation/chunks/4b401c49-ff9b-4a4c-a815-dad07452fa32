In some embodiments, the coupler 2602C includes an even-mode-shorted coupler for enabling or sustaining an out-of-phase coupling mode between the two oscillators 2602A, 2602B. In some embodiments, the even-mode-shorted coupler may include a transmission line arrangement electrically connected between the two oscil- lators 2602A, 2602B, and a capacitive arrangement electri- cally connected with the transmission line arrangement and operable to facilitate shorting of even-mode impedance.\n\n[0117] In some embodiments, the patch antenna arrange- 2604 includes an on-chip patch antenna arrangement.\n\nment\n\n[0118]\n\nIn some embodiments, the patch antenna arrange-\n\nment 2604 includes multiple (e.g., two) patch elements each respectively operably coupled with the two oscillators 2602A, 2602B. In some examples, the patch elements may be generally identical in terms of shape and size and material. Optionally, the patch elements may each be part (e.g., half) of a respective larger patch. In some embodi- ments, one patch element is electrically coupled (e.g capacitively coupled) with the third circuit arrangements of the two oscillators 2602A, 2602B and another patch element is electrically coupled (e.g., capacitively coupled) with the fourth circuit arrangements of the two oscillators 2602A, 2602B. In some embodiments, the first transistors of the two oscillators 2602A, 2602B are arranged to selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to one of the patch elements, and the second transistors of the two oscillators 2602A, 2602B are arranged to selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the other one of the patch\n\nelements.", "type": "Document"}}
