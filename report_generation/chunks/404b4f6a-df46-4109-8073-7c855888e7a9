The SW/HW acceleration of point_wise_mul and point_wise_add function increase with the parameter k and. 1 respectively, because vectorized method is applied to reduce the data transmission amounts. The matrix_mul (k=6, 1-5) is calculated by first using point_wise_mul (k=6) five times to obtain an intermediate matrix and then using point_wise_add (1=5) six times to obtain the final output, as shown in the two steps of FIG. 3. The matrix sampling is adjusted to be sampled by column so that the transfer address is continuous when the PWM is calculated, thereby reducing the number of DMA transfers. Thanks to the high-performance architecture design of the SHAKE mod- ule, the H,5,(1952, 48) function achieves a speedup of 96 when compared with the pure software time. This result demonstrates that the high-speed architecture design for the time-consuming functions gives a good trade-off.\n\n[0122] After the system integration, the Dilithium signa- algorithms on both pure software and hardware-soft-\n\nture\n\nProcessor cache turn on Processor cache turn off SW SW/HW SW SWHW Function time(us) time(us) Speedup time(us) time(hs) Speedup nit (n = 256) 177 15.6 4 2223 14.2 155.9 intt (n = 256) 227 15.6 14.5 3096 143 216.9 point_wise_mul (k = 1) 30.8 12.7 4.0 725 11.2 64.6 point_wise_mul (k = 6) 306 36.9 83 4336 16.6 261.0 point_wise_add (I = 2) 248 12.6 2.0 455 11.0 413 point_wise_sub (1 = 2) 248 12.6 2.0 455 11.1 41.1 point_wise_add (I = 5) 51.6 16.6 3.1 988 17 84.7 matrix_mul (k = 6, | = 5) 1194 229 52 17910212 84.2 Hys6(32, 96) 63.4 4.0 15.5 1004 63 158.6 Hys6(1952, 48) 954 99 96.1 14819 95 1558 Hi2s + rej_uniform (n = 256) 341 115 29.7 5477 11.9 461.3 Hizs + rej_eta_4 (n = 256) 146 11.6 12.5 2330 11.9 195.2 Hyog + rej_eta_2 (n = 256) 81.1 11.0 74 1289 11.2 114.8", "type": "Document"}}
