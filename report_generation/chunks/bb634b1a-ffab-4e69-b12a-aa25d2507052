From the simulation results, we can conclude that the pro- posed FSSD computation method may reduce the encoding time by around 10% to 15% in different QP values. We estimate that about 4% to 7% reduction is achieved by the iterative table-lookup quantization process and 5% to 7% reduction is achieved by avoiding the inverse transform and pixel reconstruction.
