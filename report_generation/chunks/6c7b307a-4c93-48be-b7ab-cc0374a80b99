These structures were fabricated by two-photon absorption (TPA) using a 3D laser lithography system (Nanoscribe GmbH). The photoresist IP-Dip was drop-cast onto a fused silica substrate, and a 60x objective lens was immersed directly in the photoresist. The 3D microstructures were point-by-point cured by direct laser writing according to the design. After laser writing, the structures were developed in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 20 min, rinsed in isopropyl alcohol, and dried with nitrogen gas.\n\n[0104] Degradation at high temperatures. can be used for thermomolding of plastics such as PFA and PET at temperatures higher than the producer-recommended maximum working temperature of PDMS (204\u00b0 C.) for a few times. The lifespan of PDMS is limited owing to the degradation at such high temperatures. The degradation is resulted from the Si\u2014O bond fracture in the presence of terminal groups, e.g.: =Si\u2014OH. The intermediate product of the degradation can be regarded as a complex with a pentavalent Si-atom, and a hydrogen bond between the hydrogen from the =Si\u2014OH and the oxygen from the siloxane. The Si\u2014C bond fracture results in methane pro- duction. The decomposition leads to a decrease in the molecular weight of PDMS, hence resulting in an increased.\n\n[0099] Mechanical Dynamics of PDMS Associated Curing Dynamics\n\n[0100] Crosslinking. In this work, PDMS room tempera- ture vulcanized silicone (RTV615) supplied by Momentive was used. RTV615 contains two components: (a) RTV A that contains a dimethylvinyl terminated pre-polymer and a Pt-catalyst, and (b) RTV B that contains a cross-linker with several hydride groups. In the presence of the Pt catalyst, the hydrosilane bond of the cross-linker (=SiH) can add into the carbon-carbon double bond of the pre-polymer through hydrosilylation. In this way, the per-polymer chains cross- link into a polymer network.", "type": "Document"}}
