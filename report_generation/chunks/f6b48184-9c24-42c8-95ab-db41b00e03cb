In some applications which require a relatively high-speed throughput of the memory device, temporary memory devices such as random access memory (RAM) may be used, in which the speed of the read/write operation is extremely fast to facilitate the process of the data or signal of the entire system using the memory device.\n\n[0017] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the plurality basic memory blocks includes multiple blocks connected in a parallel form to increase the width of the TCAM structure.", "type": "Document"}}
