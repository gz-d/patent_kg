The system may be a sensing system, a communication system, a spectroscopic system, an imaging system, etc. In one example, the system is an active terahertz imaging system arranged to illuminate objects (e.g., targeted objects). In one example, the system is a cellular (e.g., 5G, 6G, above 6G, or the like) communication system.\n\n[0055] In a sixth aspect, there is provided a system for providing terahertz electromagnetic radiation comprising at least one of the device of the third aspect. The system may be a sensing system, a communication system, a spectro- scopic system, an imaging system, etc. In one example, the system is an active terahertz imaging system arranged to illuminate objects (e.g., targeted objects). In one example, the system is a cellular (e.g., 5G, 6G, above 6G, or the like) communication system.\n\n[0056] Other features and aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings. Any feature(s) described herein in relation to one aspect or embodiment may be combined with any other feature(s) described herein in relation to any other aspect or embodiment as appropriate and applicable.\n\n[0057] Terms of degree such that \u201cgenerally\u201d, \u201cabout\u201d, \u201csubstantially\u201d, or the like, are used, depending on context, to account for manufacture tolerance, degradation, trend, tendency, imperfect practical condition(s), etc. For example, when a value is modified by terms of degree, such as \u201cabout\u201d, such expression may include the stated value+10%, +5%, +2%, or +1%.\n\n[0058] Unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201cconnected\u201d, \u201ccoupled\u201d, \u201cmounted\u201d or the like, are intended to encompass both direct and indirect connection, coupling, mounting, etc.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
