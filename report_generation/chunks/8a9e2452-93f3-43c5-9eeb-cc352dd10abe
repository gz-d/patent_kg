It can be observed from FIG. 1K that the strength of the DMWES membrane is slightly enhanced to 6 MPa because of the high strength of the hydrophobic C-PVDF layer. Good water vapor transfer rate (WVTR) has a significant impact on the wearing experience. The fabric with porous gradient structures and asymmetric wettability can continuously transport water vapor from the hydrophobic C-PVDF layer to the hydro- philic fibrous PAN layer rapidly. As a result, the WVT of sample-3 at 25\u00b0 C. and 50% relative humidity (RH) can attain a WVTR of 13.99 kg m~ d7', which decreases slightly with the increase in the electrospraying MXene/ CNTs amount (FIG. 1L). The value is comparable to the WVTR of commercial e-PTFE (15.1 kg m-* dr, indicating\n\ngood wear comfort.\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nExample 3.
