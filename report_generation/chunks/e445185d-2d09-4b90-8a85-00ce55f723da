However, this only partially resolves the problem at the expense of increas- ing the physical size, complexity and cost of the electronic circuit or system. Moreover, the added capacitors might reso- nate with the stray inductance within the circuit and the ESL of other added capacitors.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nThere are two main approaches to canceling the effects parasitic inductance on a circuit or system. The first is based canceling the parasitic inductance of a particular compo- nent while the second is based on canceling the effect caused all parasitic inductances in the entire circuit or system.\n\nsystems presents unique challenges for circuit designers. The operating frequency of modern electrical and electronic equipment continues to increase, in order to reduce the physi- cal size and weight of the electronic circuits and systems. However, the trend is hindered by the possible generation of undesirable effects, such as ringing and resonance, due to parasitic effects associated with the components, the physical orientation of the components, and/or the layout of compo- nents, devices and/or conductive tracks on printed circuit boards within an electronic circuit or system. These parasitic elements degrade the high-frequency performance of the entire electronic circuit", "type": "Document"}}
