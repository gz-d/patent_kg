The information handling system 300 may have different configurations, and it gen- erally comprises suitable components necessary to receive, store, and execute appropriate computer instructions, com- mands, or codes. The main components of the information handling system 300 are a processor 302 and a memory unit 304. The processor 302 may be formed by one or more CPU, MCU, controllers, logic circuits, Raspberry Pi chip, etc. The memory unit 304 may include one or more volatile memory unit (such as RAM, DRAM, SRAM), one or more non- volatile unit (such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FRAM, MRAM, FLASH, SSD, NAND, and NVDIMM), or any of their combinations. The information handling system 300 may further include one or more input devices 306 such as a keyboard, a mouse, a stylus, an image scanner, a microphone, a tactile input device (e.g., touch sensitive screen), and an image/video input device (e.g., camera). The image/video input device may be used to form an image of the specimen. The information handling system 300 may further include one or more output devices 308 such as one or more displays (e.g., monitor), speakers, disk drives, headphones, earphones, printers, 3D printers, etc. The dis- play may include a LCD display, a LED/OLED display, or any other suitable display that may or may not be touch sensitive. The display may be used to show the imaged specimen. The information handling system 300 may further include one or more disk drives 312 which may encompass", "type": "Document"}}
