As shown in FIG. 17(a), the output voltage of the diode rectifier has high voltage ripple. However, the output voltage of the valley-fill circuit is significantly reduced as shown in FIG. 17(6). In embodiments of this invention, the valley-fill circuit is not connected directly to the load or another power con- verter as in prior art, but is connected directly to an inductor oracoupled-inductor based current ripple cancellation circuit for providing a smooth current to the LED load.\n\nFIG. 26 shows the variable inductor L, of FIG. 24 based core saturation;\n\nFIG. 27 is a graph showing the output voltage of a diode bridge only circuit;\n\nFIG. 28(a) is a graph showing the output voltage of the circuit of FIG. 18 in which C1=C2=220 uF;\n\nFIG. 28(4) is a graph showing the output voltage of the circuit of FIG. 18 in which C1=C2=22 uP;\n\nFIG. 29 show capacitors C1 and C2 connected in series; and\n\nIn embodiments of the invention an inductor (FIG. 4(a)) coupled inductor with ripple cancellation (FIG. 4(4)) may used to limit the output current ripple and hence the power variation for the LED load.", "type": "Document"}}
