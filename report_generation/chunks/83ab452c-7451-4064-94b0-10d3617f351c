The system 300 also includes a monitor device 312, e.g., a camera, for monitoring the processing status of the optical fiber, e.g., the shape of the optical tip during processing. A controller 314 is operably connected with the monitor device 312, the driving sources 306 and the laser source 308, to control the processing of the optical fiber 100\u00b0. The control- ler 314 may include a processor and a memory. The pro- cessor may be formed by one or more CPU, MCU, control- lers, logic circuits, Raspberry Pi chip, etc. The controller 314 is arranged to receive data indicative of the status (shape, form, etc.) of the tip of the fiber 100' from the monitor device 312, process the received data to determine the status of the tip, and then provide output to control operation of the driving sources 306 and the laser source 308. For example, the controller may control the power of the laser source, the movement of the clamps 304 (which affect tension of the optical fiber 100\") based on the status of the tip detected by the monitor device 312. The controller 314 provides a feedback system that allows the fiber tip\u2019s radius and surface to be controlled.\n\n[0018] FIG. 2 is a flow chart of a method for producing a device for providing electrons in one embodiment of the invention;\n\n[0019] FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a system producing the device of FIG. 1 in one embodiment of invention;\n\n[0020] FIG. 4 is a graph showing a relationship of the material energy barrier (eV) and distance of electronics from the metallic surface (nm) of the device of FIG. 1 for different materials (M1, M2, M3); and", "type": "Document"}}
