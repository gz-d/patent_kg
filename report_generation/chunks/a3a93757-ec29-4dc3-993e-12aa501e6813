The method includes: preparing a first polymer-covered glass substrate with a nano-thickness metal film deposited thereon; immersing the first polymer-covered glass substrate with the metal film to delaminate one or more 2D freestand- ing organic-metal nanosheets from the first polymer-covered glass substrate; transferring the one or more 2D freestanding organic-metal nanosheets onto a second target substrate; and annealing the one or more 2D freestanding organic-metal nanosheets to decompose an organic portion of the organic- metal nanosheet into an amorphous carbon-containing shell forming a metal-carbon nanocomposite of a core-shell struc- ture.\n\n[0009] In accordance to one embodiment, the polymer used in the first polymer-covered glass substrate including PVA.\n\n[0010] In accordance to one embodiment, the second target substrate includes a planar substrate or a non-planar substrate.\n\n[0011] In accordance to another embodiment, the planar substrate includes silicon, fused silica, glass, or sapphire.\n\n[0012] In accordance to yet another embodiment, non-planar substrate includes an anodized alumina oxide plate and Mo grid.\n\n(AAO)\n\nthe\n\na\n\n[0013] In accordance to one embodiment, the metal film gold (Au) film.\n\nis", "type": "Document"}}
