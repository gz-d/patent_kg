Therefore, a capacitor should be added to the primary winding to form a resonant tank. The second-stage inverter should be operated at this resonant frequency to ensure that the current in the winding is sinusoidal.\n\nFIG. 10 shows an AC-DC current-mode controlled first- stage boost converter feeding a constant current source to second-stage full-bridge fixed frequency inverter,\n\nFIG. 11 shows an AC-AC current-mode controlled first- stage flyback converter feeding a full-bridge inverter that provides a step-down current source through a transformer, and\n\nFIG. 1 shows an embodiment of an electronic control sys- tem for an inductive charging pad (primary system) and com- prising the two power stages that drive a primary winding that forms part (or all) of an active group of the charging pad. The front or first-stage power converter depends on the nature of the input power supply. If the power supply is an AC mains, this first-stage power converter should be an AC-DC power converter. If there is a DC power supply, then the first-stage power converter should be a DC-DC power converter. In either case, the output voltage (ie., DC-link voltage Vy, in FIG. 1) should be a controllable variable.\n\nFIG. 12 shows an AC-AC voltage-mode controlled first- stage flyback converter feeding a full-bridge inverter that provides a step-down current source through a transformer.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nFor planar battery charging systems, the use of a standard charging pad enables charging inductively a wide range of portable electronic products. In order provide such a pad, preferably several conditions are met:", "type": "Document"}}
