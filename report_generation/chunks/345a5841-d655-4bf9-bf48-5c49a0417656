The covalent organic frame- work may include a plurality of dithioether-linked benzo- quinone moieties.\n\n[0008] Optionally, the covalent organic framework com- prises a structural representation of Formula (1):\n\nFormula (1)\n\nO S O ies 8 - Ss s 8 O Ss o so \u3001 8 8. 8 8 8 8 0 S O O Ss 8 8 : N \u4e00 0, S oO Ss OO 8 8 8 S \u540c oO\n\nLIBs. However, obtaining high-performance cathode mate- rials is the main issue that restrict the improvement of the capacity of SIBs.\n\n[0004] Comparing with inorganic electrode materials, organic electrode materials are renewable, designable for specific function, and have higher theoretical gravimetric capacities. Some organic small molecules with active groups have shown excellent device performance when utilized as a cathode material for SIBs. Nevertheless, they exhibit obvious drops on the capacities from the second cycle due\n\n[0009] In a second aspect, there is provided an anode comprising an electrode material with a covalent organic framework that includes a plurality of aromatic moieties each being linked by at least one thioether linkage, such as the covalent organic framework comprises a structural rep- resentation of Formula (1).\n\n[0010] In a third aspect, there is provided an energy storage device, comprising a cell having an anode, wherein anode is formed from an electrode material with covalent organic framework that includes a plurality\n\nthe\n\na\n\nof\n\nUS 2024/0079591 Al\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
