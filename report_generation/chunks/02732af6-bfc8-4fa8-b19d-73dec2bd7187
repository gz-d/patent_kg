The DC power terminals 1506, 1508 of a tradi- tional power adaptor or charger, if used, will be connected to IN+ and IN- of the modified circuit as usual (Fig.15). This arrangement further simplifies the manufacturing process of the battery pack that will now become com- patible with the inductive battery charging platform of Fig. 2 with perpendicular magnetic flux as well as a traditional power adaptor. Fig.16 shows the essential component parts of the proposed battery pack including a battery pack casing 1600, battery 1602, a soft magnetic sheet 1604 with winding 1606 placed on top of the battery 1602, a cover 1608 for the active side of the battery pack, and a modified charging and protection circuit 1610 including the extra diode rectifier and capacitors. Figs.17(a) and 17(b) show the simple assembling process of these parts for a battery pack. [0031] As long as the \"active side\" of the battery pack faces the surface of the charging platform, the electronic equipment 1800, 1802 can be charged by the planar in- ductive charging platform 1804 as shown in Fig.18. It should be noted that the proposed device in Fig. 11 and Fig.12 can be a separate device or can be integrated into a battery pack (Fig.17) as explained above. When used", "type": "Document"}}
