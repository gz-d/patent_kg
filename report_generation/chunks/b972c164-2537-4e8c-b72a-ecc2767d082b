(Nat Genet, 1995), with modifications. Embryos are to be mounted laterally in 0.3% agarose as described low. Fluoresceinated and carboxylated latex microbeads (0.02-um, cat# F-8787, Molecular Probes, USA) are then injected into the sinus venosus. The bead suspension should be diluted 1:1 with 2% BSA, sonicated at maximum power for 5 minutes, then centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 minutes. The supernatant is then to be transferred to a new tube for injection. Glass microneedles are then prepared from 1 mm OD capillaries (World Precision Instruments, cat # TW100-4 or TW100E-4 for glass without or with an internal filament) by using a Narishige PC-10 micropipette puller. To make these microneedles, this micropipette puller is required to pull the glass capillary vertically using the gravitational force of its own weight. A double pull is set in which the first pull is at a temperature of 76\u00b0 C. and the second pull is at a temperature of 64\u00b0 C. Microneedles are then to be broken open by a Narishige MF-900 micro-forge to give an opening of approxi- mately 5 hm in width. The tip of microneedle needs to be broken by pushing against a small drop of glass melted on to the platinum wire of the micro-forge, monitored at 10x object of the micro-forge. No pipette holding is needed in this pro- tocol since the embryos are mounted in agarose. The bead. suspension is then loaded into a microneedle at the wider end with a micropipette loader. A glass microneedle is then inserted obliquely into the sinus venosus. Many (20+) small boluses of bead suspension should be injected over the course of up to a minute. Confocal images are acquired after letting the embryo recover for 3-5 minutes. The instrument setting is like the one described below. Afier injection, fluorescent beads will circulate around the whole vascular network, light- ing up each blood vessel with active blood flow from the heart.
