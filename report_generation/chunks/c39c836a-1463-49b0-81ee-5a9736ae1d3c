The bulk solder joint ad a shear strength of 33.52 MPa (+1.5 Mpa), while the uniform and small-sized solder particles treated joint had a significantly higher shear strength of 36.93 MPa (+1.5 Mpa), which was 9% higher than that of bulk solder. This indicated. that the uniform solder particles prepared by ultrasonication could effectively enhance the mechanical properties of sol- der\n\njoints.\n\n[0084] These data collectively demonstrated that the sizes of the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles could be precisely controlled via the combined treatment of ultrasonication and ice-water bath cooling. Moreover, the thus-produced Sn \u4e00 Bi\u2014In base solder particles were capable of bonding two Cu substrates at room temperature within a short time, thereby greatly reducing the manufacturing cost and increasing industrial throughput. As a result, the alloy of the present disclosure has promising applications in terms of the manu- facture of advanced semiconductor devices, such as 3D IC packaging.\n\n[0085] It will be understood that the above description of embodiments is given by way of example only and that various modifications may be made by those with ordinary skill in the art.
