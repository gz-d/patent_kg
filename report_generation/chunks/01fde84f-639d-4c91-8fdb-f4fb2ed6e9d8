The processor 120 enhances stimulations by the dominant electrode 112 through the audio signal AS2, and the domi- nant electrodes 112 are corresponded to signals range from 212 Hz to 1.4 kHz. In other words, the dominant electrodes 112 correspond to the FO component, and the FO component is within the FO range of the average male and female spoken voice, and within the average melodic range of most targeted musical excerpts.\n\n2018. Various embodiments of the\n\ninvention\n\npresent provide modification of audio signals by signal processing of the original audio source or by the generation of new audio content based on features extracted from the original. The auditory stimulus can be played back by one or more loudspeakers, such as consumer headphones or earphones, or used to modify settings (e.g., hardware settings) of a cochlear implant. The above can be used to personalize the auditory stimulus produced by such devices in order to adjust for the unique characteristics of a user\u2019s perception of musical features and the limitations of their cochlear implant.\n\nMoreover, the method for processing audio signals further includes digitally adjusting audio signals AS1 using the determined hearing profile; and converting the digitally adjusted signals to analog signals using a digital-to-analog converter. The adjusting step includes adjusting amplitude, phase, and/or frequency of one or more or all components of the music signals.", "type": "Document"}}
