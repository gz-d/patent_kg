In some embodiments, the two positions on the index finger are, for example, the distal of the index finger and a middle phalanx of the index finger, and the tip of the distal phalanx serves as a starting point during a period of performing1D continuous movement.\n\nto\n\nThen, in some embodiments, each of the 1D-continuous- movement training data sets is filtered, by a low-pass filter, remove circuit noise after the step S410.\n\nIn the step $350: A channel-wise gradient operation is performed, by the processor P, on each of the sliding windows of each of negative training data sets to extract a negative feature vector, such that a negative feature set including the negative feature vectors is obtained.\n\nIn the step S360: A channel-wise gradient operation is performed, by the processor P, on each of the sliding windows of each of positive training data sets to extract a positive feature vector, such that a positive feature set\n\n60\n\n65\n\nIn the step $420: a sliding window operation is performed on each of the 1D-continuous-movement training data sets with a sliding window frame F (see FIG. 13), in which the sliding window frame F is moved across each of the 1D-con- tinuous-movement training data sets during the sliding win- dow operation. In detail, during the sliding window opera- tion, the processor P applies a sliding window frame F with the step size of 5 ms (1 frame) across the training data set (16 ms, 3-frames).\n\na\n\nis\n\nUS 11,822,732 B1\n\n15\n\n16", "type": "Document"}}
