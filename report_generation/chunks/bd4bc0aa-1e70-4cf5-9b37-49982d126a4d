The glass of the DR 16 has a dielectric constant of \u00a9, at microwave frequencies and a refractive index of n at optical frequencies. A vertical strip comprising the conformal excitation strip 20 with a length of 1, anda width of w, is used to feed the DR 16, which is excited inits fundamental TE, , , mode, although other modes may be selected depending on operating conditions, etc. The DR 16 is lifted up by a small gap of g for accommodating the solar cell 14. Alternatively, the solar cell 14 can be directly made at the bottom surface of the DR 16. In this latter arrangement, the bottom of the DR 16 may be recessed to accommodate the solar cell 14. In such a case, the DR 16 may have a slightly larger footprint than the solar cell 14 such that a peripheral edge portion on a bottom surface of the DR 16 acts to support the DR 16 on the grounded substrate 18. The recess may be made to be slightly larger, at least in height, than the solar cell 14 such that the DR 16 is not resting on the solar cell 14, but it is preferred that there is an intimate contact between the bottom surface of the DR 16 and the top surface of the solar cell 14, or at least a light collecting part of the top surface of\n\nAgain, in this embodiment, a solar cell 114 of any be placed beneath the DR 116 for collecting sunlight will also be demonstrated below that the hemispherical can be used to increase the output current and voltage underlaid solar cell 114.", "type": "Document"}}
