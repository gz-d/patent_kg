FIG. 6a show the initial charge and discharge curves for the pristine and PGE-NCM811 materials at Mo C. The circle on the charging curve shows the H1-H2 phase transition peak in the pristine NCM811. The circles on the discharging curve direct the H2-H3 phase transition in the pristine NCM811. The differential capacity curves in this range are presented in the inset. FIG. 65 shows the capacity retentions for the pristine and PGE-NCM811 materials at Mo C. FIGS. 6c-6d show charge-discharge curves at different cycles for FIG. 6c the pristine and FIG. 6\u00a2 PGE-NCM811 materials. The arrows show the trends of capacity and voltage fade during cycling. FIG. 6e shows the rate capability of the\n\npristine and PGE-NCM811 materials.\n\n[0014] FIG. 7 shows the EELS spectra of Mn and L-edges scanning.\n\nCo\n\n[0015] FIG. 8 shows the conversion relation between hexagonal R-3m and monoclinic C2/m unit cell.\n\n[0016] FIG. 9a-9b show the AC impedance spectra of the pristine and PGE-NCM811 before (FIG. 9a) and after (FIG. cycles at charged state (4.3 V).\n\n96\n\n[0017] FIG. 10 shows the PITT results of both the pristine PGE-NCM811 materials.\n\nand\n\n[0018] FIGS. lla-lle depict in situ synchrotron XRD characterizations of the pristine and PGE-NCM811 materi- als at C/10 rate. FIG. 11a shows contour plots of the pristine NCMB811 along with the corresponding voltage profile. FIGS. 112-1lc show the (003) and (101) peak profiles of the in situ XRD patterns for the pristine (FIG. 115) and PGE- NCM811 (FIG. 11c) materials upon initial charging. The arrows depict the peak evolutions of H1 phase, and the green arrows show the peak evolutions of the H2 phase.
