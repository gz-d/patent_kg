In some embodiments, the source terminals of the two transistors are electrically connected, e.g., directly electrically connected, with each other. In some embodi- ments, the gate terminals of the two transistors are electri- cally connected, e.g., directly electrically connected, with each other. In some embodiments, the gate terminals of the two transistors are electrically connected with the coupler\n\nfor\n\nof\n\na\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n2602C. In some embodiments, the gate/drain/source circuits provides: a first circuit arrangement electrically connected with the source terminal of the first transistor, a second circuit arrangement electrically connected with the source terminal of the second transistor, a third circuit arrangement electrically connected with the drain terminal of the first transistor and operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement 2604, and a fourth circuit arrangement electri- cally connected with the drain terminal of the second transistor and operably coupled with the patch antenna arrangement 2604.\n\n[0109] In some embodiments, the first circuit arrangement includes a capacitive arrangement for facilitating oscillation and a transmission line arrangement for power supply. The capacitive arrangement and the transmission line arrange- ment of the first circuit arrangement may be arranged electrically in parallel. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement of the first circuit arrangement is grounded. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the first circuit arrangement is grounded.", "type": "Document"}}
