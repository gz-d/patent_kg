In some embodiments, the plurality of subwavelength units may be arranged in a 2D array. For example, the plurality of subwavelength units may be generally aligned in one or more rows and one or more columns. The plurality of subwavelength units of the array may be spaced apart evenly or unevenly.\n\n[0015] In some embodiments, each of the plurality of subwavelength units respectively comprises: a first slot formed on or in an electrically conductive layer and operable to radiate electromagnetic waves, a second slot formed on or in the electrically conductive layer and operable to radiate electromagnetic waves, a first control arrangement operably coupled with the first slot for facilitating control of operation of the first slot selectively in a radiating state (in which the first slot radiates electromagnetic waves) and a non-radiating state (in which the first slot does not radiate electromagnetic\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al", "type": "Document"}}
