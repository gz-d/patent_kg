As a result, if the SDGD subsystem is not ready for operation immediately at the start-up of the synchronous rectifier (or at another time) (e.g., is not powered up to operate at steady state), the synchronous rectifier can still function to rectify an input power signal and produce a desired rectified signal as an output (e.g., diode-bridge type functionality is inherent in the synchronous rectifier). For example, the SDGD subsystem can operate to control the switches on the top-side portion and the switches on the low-side portion so that these switches will not change state (e.g., switch to an on state) until the SDGD subsystem has been set up, for example, during initial gate-drive start up, to operate at steady state. In still another aspect, the system can include a zero-cross con- troller component(s) that can facilitate providing a desired positive voltage signal to a comparator(s) associated with a switch(es) (e.g., low-side switch) to facilitate ensuring that the associated switch(es) is in an off state at or near zero- crossing points during half-cycles of the signal. In yet another aspect, the multi-phase synchronous rectifier can be employed in high-voltage power applications (e.g., 110 V or", "type": "Document"}}
