In the following descrip- tion, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It may be evident, however, that the disclosed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block dia- gram form in order to facilitate describing the various embodiments herein.\n\nDiode bridges, sometimes also referred to as bridge recti- fiers, can be used to rectify a received AC signal and produce a DC signal as output. One significant drawback with diode bridges is a relatively high amount of conductive loss realized in processing the received signal. For example, the typical voltage drop V,, of a power diode is 1.0 volt (V). For a diode current I, of 10 amps (A), the conduction loss is 10 watts (W), in accordance with the equation P=V_xl,.", "type": "Document"}}
