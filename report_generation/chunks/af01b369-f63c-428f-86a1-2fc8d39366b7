The dielectric block 102 is substantially solid and has generally rectangular form. The dielectric block 102 has a length L,, a width W,, a height H,,, and a dielectric constant E,. The dielectric block 102 includes generally parallel opposite side-surfaces and a base surface that together define the groove 106. The groove 106 extends through the dielectric block 102 from one end 102A of the dielectric block to the other (opposite) end 102B of the dielectric block 102. In this example, the groove 106 gen- erally elongates along a central part of the dielectric block 102. The height (or depth) Hz of the groove 106 is about half of the height H,, of the dielectric block 102.\n\n[0032] FIG. 9B is a plot showing the measured and imulated H-plane (x-z plane) radiation patterns (at 2.45 GHz) of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna o FIG. 7 and simulated H-plane (x-z plane) radiation pattern (at 2.45 GHz) of a dielectric resonator antenna of a reference antenna corresponding to (but different from) the antenna o FIG. 7; Pa\n\n[0033] FIG. 10 is a graph showing the measured and simulated antenna gains of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna of FIG. 7 and simulated antenna gain of a dielectric resonator antenna of a reference antenna corre- sponding to (but different from) the antenna of FIG. 7;\n\n[0042] In this embodiment, the grooved dielectric block provides the microwave dielectric resonator antenna. conductor strip 110 (e.g., adhesive copper tape) is attached a base part of an outer surface of the dielectric block\n\nof\n\nFIG.\n\nthe\n\nFIG.\n\n3\n\nis\n\nthe\n\nmeasured\n\nand\n\n[0034] FIG. 11 is a graph showing the measured total antenna efficiency of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna of FIG. 7;", "type": "Document"}}
