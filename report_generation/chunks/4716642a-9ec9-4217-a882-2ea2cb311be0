The method is useful in\n\nprevent or treatment of an infection caused by a flavivirus ,\n\nan enterovirus or a lentivirus .\n\nOH\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nwherein the flavivirus infection is caused by Japanese\n\n[ 0002 ] RNA viruses , particularly positive single - stranded\n\nencephalitis virus , Zika virus or Dengue virus .\n\nRNA viruses , such as viruses from Flaviviridae , Enterovirus\n\n[ 0007 ]\n\nIn a second aspect , the present invention pertains to\n\nand Coronavirus are expanding threat in public health . West\n\na method of inhibiting the entry of a flavivirus into host cells ,\n\nNile virus , Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) , Zika virus\n\ncomprising contacting the host cells with an effective\n\namount of berbamine or its analogue , berbamine has a\n\n( ZIKV ) , Dengue virus ( DENV ) , and enterovirus A17 ( EV\n\nstructure of Formula ( I ) :\n\nA17 ) are considered as the leading causes of human and\n\nanimal infectious diseases in the world . The morbidity and\n\nmortality of related illness caused by these viruses have been\n\nFormula ( I )\n\nincreasing every year . West Nile virus has recently spread\n\nfrom the Mediterranean Basin to the Western Hemisphere\n\nand now accounts for thousands of sporadic encephalitis\n\ncases each year . Also , Japanese encephalitis have caused\n\nthousands of deaths each year in a wide range of endemic\n\nareas .\n\nN\n\n[ 0003 ] Although there are some commercially available\n\nvaccines against yellow fever , Japanese encephalitis and\n\nneonatal encephalitis , there are few or almost no effective\n\nclinical treatment against flaviviruses or enteroviruses . For\n\nexample , patients suffering from serious flavivirus or entero", "type": "Document"}}
