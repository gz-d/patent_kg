Generally, as program modules include routines, programs, objects, components and data files assisting in the performance of particular functions, the skilled person will understand that the functionality of the software application may be distributed across a number of routines, objects or components to achieve the same func- tionality desired herein.\n\nIV. Exemplary System\n\nplary information handling system 200 that can be used, in single or in multiple, to implement one or more of the above method embodiments in one embodiment of the invention. The information handling system 200 may have different configurations, and it generally includes suitable compo- nents necessary to receive, store, and execute appropriate computer instructions, commands, or codes. The main com- ponents of the information handling system 200 are a processor 202 and a memory unit 204. The processor 202 may be formed by one or more CPU, MCU, controllers, logic circuits, Raspberry Pi chip, etc. The memory unit 204 may include one or more volatile memory unit (such as RAM, DRAM, SRAM), one or more non-volatile unit (such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FRAM, MRAM, FLASH, SSD, NAND, and NVDIMM), or any of their combinations. Preferably, the information handling system 200 further includes one or more input devices 206 such as a keyboard, a mouse, a stylus, an image scanner, a micro- phone, a tactile input device (e.g., touch sensitive screen), and an image/video input device (e.g., camera). The infor- mation handling system 200 may further include one or", "type": "Document"}}
