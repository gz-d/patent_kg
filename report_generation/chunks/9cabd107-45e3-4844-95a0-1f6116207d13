As shown in FIG. 6D, the membrane 608 may have a size that is sufficient to cover both the openings of the compartments (606A, 606B) and at least part of cross-section surface of the chamber 602. In this way, when the two portions (602A, 602B) are screwed together, the membrane 608 is sandwiched and fixed ther- ebetween. As such, the antigens in the sample solution retained by the compartment 606B are captured by the receptors as discussed in the earlier part of this disclosure.\n\n[0085] In addition, the membrane may be easily tuned selectively sensing the antigens of other types of cancer, target substances such as viruses, nanoparticles, and the like, by simply fabricating different aptamers the membrane.\n\n[0086] Furthermore, the fabrication process is also simple and the electrochemical detector may be readily fabricated using different simple fabrication processes including low- cost fabrication methods such as printing and solution processing with low-cost materials. The fabrication of the electrochemical apparatuses may be easily scaled up. Also, the detector only requires a minimal amount of sample (i.e. 1 mL) for each measurement. In this way, the each mea- surement may be replicated for several times thereby mini- mizing the effect of measurement error.", "type": "Document"}}
