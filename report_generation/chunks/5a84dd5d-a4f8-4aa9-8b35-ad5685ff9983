The elastic crack was generated by using modified soft lithography by controlling the curing dynamics of PDMS. First, RTV 615 PDMS (General Electric) was thoroughly mixed in a 10:1 mass ratio of prepolymer to curing agent and degassed in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min. Then, the PDMS mixture was oured on the closed-loop master and cured at room tem- erature (22\u00b0 C.) for 24 h (denoted as Phase I). Note that, PDMS would cure sufficiently in 24 hours at 25\u00b0 C. to permit andling, while the time window for the operation could be extended to 48 h. After that, the elastic crack was formed by carefully peeling off the cured PDMS. The PDMS was then baked for 30 min at 150\u00b0 C. (denoted as Phase II). The temperature was gradually raised up (typically 10\u00b0 C. per minute) from room temperature at the beginning of baking.\n\nprocess. ity of the elastic crack was utilized for replication of true 3D jerarchical structures. The casting step was conducted according to the procedure for the crack formation. Then the PDMS mold was attached on a glass slide for molding thermoplastic plate. The thermoplastic plate was hot-pressed with the PDMS mold at molten state for 1 min under a pressure of ~0.2 MPa. After that, the sandwich was cooled. down to room temperature gradually while the pressure was kept. The product replica was obtained after the PDMS mold. was peeled off. Thermoplastic materials such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LL- DPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyurethan (PU), polycarbonate (PC), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), poly- ethylene terephthalate (PET), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymers (ABS) were employed for molding a set", "type": "Document"}}
