To demonstrate the gen- erality of our generator, we then measured the electricity generation under different aqueous solutions. At low ion concentration of 10-7 mol/L (pure DI water), the electricity generation is negligible owing to the shortage of suflicient ions for the formation of EDLs at both the source/water and drain/water interfaces simultaneously. The maximum peak voltage up to ~170 V appears when the ion concentration is increased to 10-3 mol/L, beyond which the output voltage decays. This is because, at high concentrations, ions in the bulk water might screen the EDL, which prevents their directional flow to the virtual source or drain surfaces. Please see FIG. 15. Embodiments made of PTFE in accor- dance with the present invention also exhibits relatively good stability owing to the strong charge and wetting stability of PTFE. Please see FIG. 10. Such a charge stability is also strengthened by the continuous droplet impinging, which can provide charges to PTFE and thus preserve superior stability. Thus, in coupled with serving as the energy source and the gate-like channel as discussed above, the water droplet manifests triple functions. For control devices made of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Poly- propylene (PP) as the virtual source, the performances decay rapidly due to the poor charge stability on these surfaces, although their initial power outputs are comparable with that", "type": "Document"}}
