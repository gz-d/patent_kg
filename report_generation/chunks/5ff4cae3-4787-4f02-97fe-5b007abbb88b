Furthermore as the circuit contains only passive components rather than active components complicated control circuitry (which may also require electrolytic capacitors) can be avoided.\n\nFIGS. 11(a)-(d) show (a) simulated voltage and current of the LED module for the circuit of FIG. 9, (b) simulated total power for the LED module and for individual LEDs in the module for the system in FIG. 9, (c) and (d) two examples of the relationship between a variation of LED power and lumi- nous flux fluctuation for a LED system using 3 W LED devices;\n\nIn addition to the elimination of electrolytic capacitors, the design is also concerned with the input power factor because there is an international standard IEC-61000 governing the input power factor.
