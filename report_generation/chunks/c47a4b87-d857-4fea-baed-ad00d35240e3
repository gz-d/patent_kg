Agarose solution (0.3%) is prepared and. kept at around 45\u00b0 C. on a heat block. Embryos are to be transferred to a clean slide by using a Pasteur pipette with a broad opening. To avoid yolk sac damaging, a small drop of solution should be added to the embryo before addition of pre-heat 0.3% agarose to the embryo. With a 27 G needle, the embryo is arranged to the appropriated position just before the agarose hardens (it usually requires a minute or two).", "type": "Document"}}
