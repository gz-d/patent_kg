A total of ten healthy male SD rats (aged 10-12 weeks, 400-500 g) were utilized for biceps femoris muscle wound evaluation. Another ten SD rats are utilized for in-vivo biodegradability evaluation. The SD rats were first treated with gaseous light anesthesia (isoflurane), then injected with chloral hydrate (10 wt %, 0.3 m1/100 g) for deep anesthesia. Following the anesthetization, a required wound (5 mm in width; 2 mm in depth) was created on the surface of biceps femoris muscle.
