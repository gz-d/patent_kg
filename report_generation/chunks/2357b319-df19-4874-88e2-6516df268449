First, the metal-carbon nanosheets were collected in a small plastic tube with DI water. After drying for 8 hours at 60\u00b0 C., the nanosheets were transferred to glass slides or sapphire substrates for later use. The flash DSC specimens were prepared using the nanosheets, which were transferred from the glass slides or sapphire substrates onto temperature- corrected sensors (MultiSTAR UFS1, Mettler-Toledo, Swit- zerland) under a stereo microscope. During flash DSC, silicone oil was applied on the chip surface to facilitate heat transfer between the nanosheets and the chip. To further study the thermal stability of the nanosheets, the nanosheets were also heated on the sapphire substrates in the Netzsch DSC system in an argon (Ar) environment at a heating rate\n\nof 1\u00b0 C//s.\n\n[0085] Scalable Production of Metal-Carbon Composite: [0086] The metal-carbon nanosheets were transferred to the sapphire substrates. After that, the metal-carbon nanosheets were dried and heated up in a muffle furnace to a target temperature between 300-800\u00b0 C. at a rate of 10\u00b0 C./min. Isothermal annealing was then performed for 0.5-10 hours in air to produce metal-carbon nanoparticles.\n\n[0087] Structural and Property Characterizations of Metal- Carbon Composite and Nanoparticles\n\n[0088] Structural characterization was carried out for metal-carbon composite and nanoparticles by using scan- ning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI-Versa 3D Dual Beam) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS),\n\nthe\n\nUS 2023/0064413 Al", "type": "Document"}}
