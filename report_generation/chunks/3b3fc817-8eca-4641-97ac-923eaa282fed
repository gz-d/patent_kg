In this manner, the amplitude and phase of the excited magnetic polarizability can be decoupled and controlled indepen- dently.\n\n[0177] Arbitrary polarizations can be decomposed into linear combination of two complete orthogonal polarization\n\nbases, e.g., lt) and lv) and vice versa. In this example, the anisotropic meta-atom includes a pair of 45\u00b0-inclined ellip- tical slot openings with a large length-to-width ratio, and the associated radiated electric field polarization is perpendicu- lar to the long side (FIG. 23). Applying independent STC matrixes to the +45\u00b0-inclined slots in each meta-atom allows independent control over the amplitude and phase contents\n\nof\n\nthe extracted ly) and IW components, resulting in arbi- trary polarization generation by the universal metasurface antenna 400. Specifically, an identical time gradient 3t,(x)/ 8x is adopted for both the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings such\n\nthat the lu) and IW components share the same momentum and output direction. Different initial time delays and duty cycles may be applied to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to control the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the radiated I) and IW components, respectively. The univer- sal metasurface antenna 400 is loaded with different STC matrixes (FIG. 51) to generate six representative polariza- tions, which includes Ix) , ly) , I) , I), ILCP , and IRCP\n\n) (FIG. 9).\n\nfurther details\n\ntheoretical\n\n[0178] For completeness, on the radiation pattern of the universal metasurface antenna 400 is provided.", "type": "Document"}}
