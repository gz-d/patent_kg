For example, solar energy collection system 1800 can include a communi- cations antenna 1808 configured to receive a reflected com- munications signal from the selective transmission layer 1806 as described above regarding FIGS. 7-8. For instance, communications antenna 1808 can include a horn antenna located proximate to the reflector structure (e.g., reflector 702) and adapted or configured to collect a portion of the reflected communications signals.\n\nVarious embodiments of the disclosed subject matter pro- vide methodologies for solar energy collection and use in communications systems as described below with reference to FIG. 19. For instance, FIG. 19 depicts a flowchart illustrat- ing exemplary non-limiting methodologies 1900 for solar energy collection and use in communications systems as described herein. For instance, exemplary methodologies 1900 can include collecting and employing solar energy proximate to a communications antenna (e.g. GA 300, GA 500, etc.).", "type": "Document"}}
