For instance, as further described above regarding FIGS. 7-8, communications antenna can include a horn antenna located proximate to the reflector structure (e.g., reflector 702) and adapted or config- ured to collect a portion of the reflected communications signals.\n\nIn yet other non-limiting implementations of solar energy collection antenna, one or more antenna element(s) (e.g., SPA 102, etc.) can be configured into an array of antenna element(s). As an example, further implementations can employ six antenna element(s) (e.g., reflective SPA 102 ele- ments) ina three by two array arranged on V-shaped reflective ground plane 304 as further described above regarding FIGS. 3-4. In yet another non-limiting example, implementations can employ nine antenna element(s) (e.g., reflective sus- pended plate antenna (SPA) 102 elements) in a three by three array arranged on U-shaped reflective ground plane 504 as further described above FIGS. 5-6.\n\nIn an aspect, a portion of the communications antenna (e.g., antenna 706, such as a horn antenna) can be located proximate to a focus associated with the substantially para- bolic reflector structure.
