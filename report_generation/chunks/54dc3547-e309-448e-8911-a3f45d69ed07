Then, the supply voltage V,, is chosen to be 1.4 V, and the fundamental voltage is swept at the drain (V_f) using the example simulation setup in FIG. 10.\n\nThe generated second and third harmonic currents\n\n[0186]\n\nand the net fundamental output power from the transistor are shown in FIG. 11B. Specifically, FIG. 11B shows simulated generated second and third harmonic currents and net fun- damental output power from the transistor for different fundamental voltages |V,_f)| at the drain terminal of the transistor. It is found that, in this example, by making V_{,=1.0 V, the transistor can also be driven into the triode region to cancel] the second harmonic current close to the minimal value. Coincidently, the Po_f, is near the peak under V_f)=1.0 V. Based on the determined fundamental driving voltages, the corresponding currents can be obtained using the same simulation setup. Given an oscillator topol- ogy, the corresponding component values can be explicitly synthesized based on the obtained voltages and currents. The T-embedding network-based oscillator topology can be used for terahertz harmonic oscillator design. In one example, the calculated component values are labeled on the equivalent\n\nAC lumped circuit, as shown in FIG. 5.", "type": "Document"}}
