Each system consists of a diode rectifier, a valley-fill circuit for improving the input power factor, an inductor for turning the voltage source into a current source with reduced current ripple (FIG. 4(a)) and the LED load. An alternative embodi- ment as shown in FIG. 4(8) is to replace the inductor in FIG. 4(a) with a coupled inductor and a capacitor so that these components form a coupled inductor with current ripple can- cellation function. It will be shown that such current ripple cancellation which is commonly used in high-frequency (greater than 20 kHz) switching power supplies can also be\n\nOne important aspect of this invention at least in its pre- ferred forms is to provide a way to reduce the size of the capacitors that is needed so that capacitors other than the electrolytic type can be used. With electrolytic capacitors eliminated in the lighting system, the whole system can be more reliable and last longer.\n\nFIG. 2 is a modified version of FIG. 1 and is used to illustrate this aspect of the invention.
