Preferably, the linkage between the aromatic moieties is a benzenehexathiol group.\n\n3\n\n[0046] In one embodiment, the COF may be prepared from an aromatic compound and a thiol. For example, the aromatic compound may be a quinone, more preferably a halogen-substituted quinone. The thiol may be an aromatic thiol having at least one S\u2014H group for forming at least one thioether linkage in the COF.\n\n[0047] The method of preparing the COF may including steps of: mixing the aromatic compound and the thiol form a mixture, degassing the mixture, and heating degassed mixture.\n\nthe\n\nto\n\nthe\n\n[0048] The step of mixing may involve a condensation or a cross-coupling reaction between the aromatic compound. and the thiol. For example, the step of mixing may be performed in a reaction vessel specifically designed for use in air-sensitive chemistry, e.g., a Schlenk flask or tube. The step of mixing may further include mixing a base and a solvent with the aromatic compound and the thiol to form the mixture. The base may be any one of sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, and N,N-diethylethanamine. The solvent may be any one of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, n-butanol, 1,4- dioxane, mesitylene, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethyl- acetamide, or a mixture thereof.\n\n[0049] After the step of mixing and before the step degassing, the method may further include sonicating the mixture to form a homogeneous mixture. For example, the mixture may be sonicated for about 1 min to about 30 min, about 3 min to about 15 min, or about 5 min to about 12 min.\n\nof", "type": "Document"}}
