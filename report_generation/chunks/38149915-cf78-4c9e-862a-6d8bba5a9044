However, this implies the use of perfect anchorages that can sustain fatigue loading. Furthermore, external tendons can be very vulnerable to vandalism, and should they fail they will release an enormous amount of elastic energy that can be devastating;\n\nThis invention relates to structural members, such as for example reinforced concrete beams and columns, and in par- ticular to such structural members that are provided with improved ductility.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND\n\nPRIOR ART\n\nDesigning the interface between the FRP reinforcement and the concrete so that a bond failure is triggered when stress in the tendons reaches a threshold level, thus changing bonded tendon configuration to an unbonded tendon con- figuration; and\n\nConcrete is a brittle material. Concrete structures rely largely on the deformation and yielding of the tensile rein- forcement to satisfy the ductility demand. The widespread application of high strength steel reinforcement in concrete structures has a significant drawback from a ductility point of view due to a lower degree of strain hardening and smaller ultimate elongation of the high strength steel. The application of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement encounters a similar problem, as FRPs have a low strain capacity and linear elastic stress-strain behavior up to rupture without yielding. The ductility of concrete members reinforced with non-duc- tile bars, especially FRP reinforced concrete (RC) members, has been a major concern in the studies of reinforced concrete structures in recent years.\n\nDesigning the cross-section of a member to proportionate reinforcement in order to take the advantage of the full strain capacity of concrete simultaneously with that of reinforcement.", "type": "Document"}}
