[0038] The support member 10 can be secured to the spine 2 as a support for the correction device 1. For ex- ample, the support member 10 can be fixed onto one or more vertebrae by one or more securing elements 20. Exemplary securing elements 20 can . include, but are not limited to, hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be an elongated member, which is capable of span- ning the deformed spine portion 4 or otherwise bridging between a proximal end 6 and a distal end 8 of the spine 2. The end portions 16 and 18 of the support member 10 can be fixed to an upper vertebra 6 and a lower vertebra 8 to thereby mount the correction device 1 onto the spine 2. In another exemplary embodiment, the support mem- ber 10 can be fixed to the vertebrae at multiple locations. [0039] The support member 10 can be formed of var- ious materials. For example, the support member 10 can be formed of a material that is capable of providing suf- ficient strength for the correction device 1. In one exem- plary embodiment, the support member 10 can comprise an elastic material capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force. For example, the support member 10 can be formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, or other materials with similar properties. [0040] In another embodiment, the correction device 1 can comprise one or more anchor members 30 to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4 to apply a correction force thereto. The anchor mem- bers 30 can be in various forms. For example, various bone anchors can be used to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4. Exemplary anchor members 30 can include, but are not limited to, wires, threads, hooks, screws, clamps and the like. In an ex- emplary embodiment, one or more", "type": "Document"}}
