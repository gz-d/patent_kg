Comparing with the embodiment 17, which uses only water as solvent that is equivalent to no post-processing treatment on the PVDF electrospun film, the breaking strength of the film in embodiment 17 is 9.4 Mpa. It shows that the breaking strength of the films in embodi- ments | to 8 is at least 1.5 times stronger than the untreated PVDF electrospun film in embodiment 17.\n\n[0111] Table 1 above also shows that the breaking strength of the films in embodiments 9 to 16 ranges from 18.1 to 30.4 Mpa, all at least above 18 MPa. Comparing with the embodiment 18, which uses only water as solvent that is equivalent to no post-processing treatment on the TPU electrospun film, the breaking strength of the film in embodi- ment 18 is 12.7 Mpa. It shows that the breaking strength of the films in embodiments 9 to 16 is at least 1.5 times stronger than the untreated TPU electrospun film in embodiment 18.\n\n[0112] FIGS. 2-3 are SEM photographic images showing the effect of post-processing treatment on an electrospun PVDF film according to the present invention, in which FIG. 2 is before post-processing treatment and FIG. 3 is after post-processing treatment. Inserts in FIGS. 2-3 are the magnified view on one area of the SEM photographic images in FIGS. 2-3, respectively. It can be seen that the fibers in FIG. 2 are individual-like and entangled, whereas the fibers in FIG. 3 are linked and disentangled.\n\n[0113] FIG. 4 shows mechanical strength test results two electrospun PVDF films of embodiments of the present invention, in which one is before post-processing and the other one is after post-processing treatment.", "type": "Document"}}
