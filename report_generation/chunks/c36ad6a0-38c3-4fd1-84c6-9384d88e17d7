The magnetic flux density and magnetic field gradient in this mode is around 123 mT at point 5 and 6 T/m at point 2 and 4 respectively for the workspace with a size of 100 mm. The data are shown in Table 4.\n\n[0110] Under this mode, both magnetic pulling and push- ing force can be achieved as the vector for magnetic field gradient is in opposite directions near the zero-field point. This provides a broader applications for swarm control, such as controlling a swarm of microagents.\n\nTABLE 4\n\nMagnetic flux density and magnetic field gradient for workspace of 160\n\nmm and 100 mm respectively under the third magnetic actuation mode with reference to FIG. 13A.
