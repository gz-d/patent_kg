This aligns with existing research results that spatial acuity reduces with a reduction in the distance between two thermal stimuli. While the three- modules configuration resulted in the best performance of locating the single-point thermal feedback, it was deter- mined to use a four-modules configuration, of which the accuracy and the response time have minor differences with the three-module configuration for further study. This was mainly due to the higher expressiveness for communication with more Peltier modules. With the selection of the four- module ThermEarhook, the multi-factorial RM-ANOVA showed that there is no significant effect of the location of the thermal stimulus or the direction of the temperature change on the accuracy and the response time of identifying the feedback location.\n\nApr. 20, 2023\n\n[0080] Designing Spatial Thermal Haptic Patterns Around Auricular Area\n\nthe\n\n[0081] Study 1 confirmed that users can reliably perceive the individual thermal stimulation with a 4-modules setting. To gain a deeper understanding on the affordance and the expressiveness of the 4-TEC setting, new spatial thermal patterns were configured by combining a pair of single-point thermal stimuli on the same ear and two different ears. The following dimensions were selected for the auricular spatial thermal patterns design:\n\n[0082] Temperature Direction {Hot\u2014h, Cold\u2014c}\n\n[0083] Location {Front: P1 & P5, Top: P2 & P6, Back: P3 & P7, Bottom: P4 & P8}\n\n[0084] Grouping Strategy {Different locations around left ear, Different locations around the right ear, Same location on two different ears} (for patterns involving two Peltier modules)\n\nthe\n\n[0085] Temporality {Simultaneous} (for patterns involv- ing two stimuli, controlled)", "type": "Document"}}
