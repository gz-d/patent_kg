A first prototype in accor- dance with the embodiment of FIGS. 2a and 26 was prepared. In the first prototype illustrated by FIGS. 2a and 2h, the transparent hemispherical DR 116 was made of borosilicate crown glass. The DRA of this prototype has a radius of R=28 mm and is placed above the solar cell 114. A conformal strip (excitation feedline) 120 with a width of w=12 mm and a length of 1,=19 mm is used to feed the DR 116, which was excited in its fundamental TE, ,, mode at 1.87 GHz. By using the Agilent 85070D Dielectric Probe Kit, the dielectric con- stant of the glass was measured and was found to be equal to &,=7.0 round 1.9 GHz. It should be mentioned that at optica: frequencies, the glass has a much lower dielectric constant o. \u00a9=2.17, which was calculated from its refractive index of\n\nA solar cell 14 of any shape can be placed beneath the DR 16 for collecting sunlight or ambient light. Tn this embod ment, a solar cell 14 with a radius of Re is used. It will demonstrated below that the DR 16 does not Significantly affect the output current and voltage of the underlaid solar cell to any great degree.", "type": "Document"}}
