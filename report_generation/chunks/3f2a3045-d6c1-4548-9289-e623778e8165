This comparison, which can be pre- sented as a RE value 304 or vector can in turn be an indication of any abnormalities in the operation of the device and can be processed by a RE processor 306. This is further described below with reference to FIGS. 4 and 7 where the RE is compared with an upper limit and a lower limit, and where the RE falls outside of these limits, would therefore indicate an abnormal operation condition with the device.", "type": "Document"}}
