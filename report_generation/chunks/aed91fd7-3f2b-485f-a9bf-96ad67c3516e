The subject who is particularly benefit from the present invention is an individual who has abnormal motor movement compared to ordinary healthy individuals.\n\n[0038] FIG. 4A is plot of mean firing rate of the control group and DKO group.\n\n[0039] FIG. 4B is a plot of number of bursts of the control group and DKO group.\n\n[0040] FIG. 4C is a plot of interspike interval of control group and DKO group.\n\n[0061] In an embodiment, the subject suffers from ataxia. The ataxia may be associated with a neurodegenerative disease such as, but not limited to, spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Parkinson\u2019s disease, essential tremor, and epilepsy. In a particular embodiment, the subject suffers from spinoc- erebellar ataxia (SCA). SCA is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of body balance and motor coordina- tion, speech and oculomotor difficulties. The neurostimula- tion system of the present invention applies deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology to modulate the abnormal motor movement of the subject. The neurostimulation sys- tem herein is capable of stimulating deep cerebellar nuclei of the subject for modulating SCA-associated motor symp- toms, e.g. symptomatic locomotion, thereby alleviating the symptoms.", "type": "Document"}}
