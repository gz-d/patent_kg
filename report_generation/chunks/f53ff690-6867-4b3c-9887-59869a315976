The thermoelectric devices 100 and 200 are used as a wearable power source to power other wearable electronic devices. The thermoelectric devices 100 and 200 function as thermoelectric generators having a high current density and power density. The thermoelectric devices 100 and 200 generate an electrical current when the devices are worn. The devices 100 and 200 harness i.e. harvest body heat and generate electricity when exposed to body heat. A user contacting face (i.e. face Y) of the substrate gets heated by body heat when the device 100 or 200 is wrapped around a limb of a user. For example the device 100 or 200 may be wrapped around an arm of the user. One face of the substrate is heated by the user\u2019s body heat. This creates a temperature difference across the device 100, 200. This heat (i.e. temperature difference) causes a movement of charge. The devices 100, 200 convert heat to electricity i.e. the heat causes a current flow. The current\n\n[0163] The described thermoelectric device 100, 200 func- tions as a wearable thermoelectric generator to generate electricity i.e.\n\n[0164] a current when exposed to body heat or a tempera- ture gradient from body heat. The device 100, 200 is advantageous because it provides a wearable and flexible thin film thermoelectric device (i.e. a thermoelectric gen- erator) that extracts power efficiently from a low grade heat e.g. body heat. The device 100, 200 as described is made of a flexible substrate which allows the device to be worn ona limb of the user. Alternatively the thermoelectric device 100, 200 as described can be used to harvest low grade heat from other heat sources e.g. a pipe, a thermal exchanger etc. The thermoelectric device 100, 200 is flexible and therefore can be wrapped around curved surfaces to extract heat and generate electricity.", "type": "Document"}}
