Two different shRNA con- structs (shTaf15-07 and shTaf15-44) are used to knock out TAF15 in female iMEF cells (E2C4), similarly as shown in FIG. 1. Five autosomal genes are randomly selected from different chromosomes over 2 hours. The expression level is determined by RT-qPCR and normalized to B-actin.

Genes that showed significant changes in allelic expression after 5-aza treatment (NT+5-aza vs. NT) are grouped into X chromosome (chrX) genes and auto- somal genes. By defining the expression ratio between the minor and major alleles before processing as 0 (unbalanced), and setting the expression ratio of the minor and major alleles after processing as 1 (balance), the allele ratios of Tafl5 gene knockout for X chromosome (blue) gene and autosomal gene (grey) are summarized respectively. Data is expressed as mean+SE, and data points for a single gene measured in two biological replicates are shown.
