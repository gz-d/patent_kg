In one example, the coaxial feed 1s connected at one end of the patch and the filter element is connected at another end of the patch. The coaxial feed may extend perpendicular to the face of the substrate.\n\nIn a second aspect of the invention, there 1s provided a communication device comprising filter-antenna of the first aspect. The communication device may be a wireless communication device. The communication device may be part of a communication system.\n\nthe\n\nIn a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for making a filter-antenna, comprising forming a microstrip antenna integrated with an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. The forming includes forming a microstrip antenna; and integrating, in the microstrip antenna, an absorptive filter for absorbing or dissipating energy. The two steps can be performed simultaneously.\n\na\n\nIn one embodiment of the third aspect, forming the microstrip antenna comprises forming patch antenna.\n\na\n\nIn one embodiment of the third aspect, forming the microstrip antenna comprises forming microstrip network on a first face of a substrate of the microstrip antenna.\n\nIn one embodiment of the third aspect, forming the microstrip antenna further comprises forming a defected microstrip structure in the microstrip network.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\nIn one embodiment of the third aspect, forming the microstrip antenna further comprises forming a defected ground structure on a ground plane on a second, opposite face of the microstrip antenna.\n\nIn one embodiment of the third aspect, integrating the absorptive filter comprises forming a hole in the substrate for receiving a filter element of the absorptive filter. Integrating the absorptive filter may further include arranging the filter element of the absorptive filter In the hole.", "type": "Document"}}
