The substrate assembly can have two or more substrate layers. The arrangement of the feeding network can be arranged at different positions in the substrate assembly, and it can be constructed differently. Likewise, the ground plane and the microstrip line network can be arranged at different posi- tions in the substrate assembly, or can be constructed dif- ferently. The feeding network and microstrip line network may be formed by etching. The substrate assembly may be removably attached to the dielectric resonator element. The dielectric resonator element need not be made with K9 optical glass, and can be made of any dielectric material with different dielectric constants \u00a2,.
