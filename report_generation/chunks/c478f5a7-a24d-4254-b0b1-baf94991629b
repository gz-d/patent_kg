Again, a capacitor may be provided in parallel between the inductor and the diode rec- tification circuit, the inductor being a variable inductor con- trollable such that the LED lighting system is dimmable. Also, the input inductor may be a variable conductor that is controllable that the LED is dimmable. lepen-\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n] now be described the accompanying Some embodiments of the invention wi way of example and with reference to drawings, in which:\n\nFIG. 1 shows a schematic and power profiles of a typical off-line LED lighting system according to the prior art;\n\nFIG. 2 shows a schematic and \u201cmodified\u201d power profiles off-line LED lighting system according to an embodiment the invention;\n\nIn preferred embodiments of the invention the power sup- plied to the at least one LED is permitted to vary, and the operating and/or design parameters of the at least one LED are chosen such that the variation in luminous flux resulting from the variation in power is not observable to the human eye.\n\nFIGS. 3(a)-(c) show the variation of LED power and lumi- flux in an embodiment of the present invention;\n\nFIGS. 4(a), (6) and (c) show (a) a schematic diagram of assive off-line circuit design for an LED system using an inductor for current ripple reduction, and (b) and (c) using a coupled inductor for current ripple reduction;", "type": "Document"}}
