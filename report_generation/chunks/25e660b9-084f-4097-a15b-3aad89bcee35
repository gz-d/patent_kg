Ultrafine and conductive functional materials, along with a metal salt, are combined ina solution of water and ethanol, augmented by a surfactant to formulate an electrostatic spraying ink. This ink is then electrosprayed onto the side of the hydrophobic nanofiber layer or the superhydrophilic nanofiber layer to create the conductive coating layer.\n\na\n\n[0071] In particular, the solution of water and ethanol maintains a mass ratio within the range of (5-10):(10-20). A low molecular weight polyvinylpyrrolidone, with an addi- tion amount of 0-5 wt %, serves as the surfactant. The ultrafine and conductive functional material options include graphene oxide, titanium carbide, carbon nanotube, carbon black, or acetylene black, combined with a metal salt, either lithium chloride or sodium chloride. The mass ratio among the ultrafine and conductive functional materials, surfactant, and the solution is maintained at (2-5):(0-1):20.\n\nelectrospraying\n\nThe\n\nexecuted by\n\nis\n\n[0072]\n\nprocess single-needle electrospraying device, adhering to specific electrostatic spraying conditions. These include a voltage range from 18 kV to 25 kV, an injection pump flow rate ranging from 0.04 mm/min to 0.1 mm/min, and a receiving distance maintained between 5 15\n\ncm to\n\ncm.\n\n[0073] For the formation of the hydrophobic nanofiber layer, a first spinning solution is created by adding a hydro- phobic polymer and carboxylic carbon tubes to a dimethyl- formamide and/or acetone solvent, followed by electrospin- ning. The hydrophobic polymer options encompass polyvinylidene difluoride or its copolymers, polyurethane, or polycaprolactone.", "type": "Document"}}
