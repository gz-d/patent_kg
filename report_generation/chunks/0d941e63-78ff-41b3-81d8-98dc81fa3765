Therefore, a convenient and safe electrostimulation device is crucial when it is used in tissue regeneration. Many elec- trostimulation devices are still under research and develop- ment stage, which still need some time to become clinically applicable.\n\n[0003] In general, conventional electrostimulation devices include two main categories: transcutaneous and invasive electrostimulations. In terms of therapeutic effect, invasive electrostimulation is generally believed to be better than transcutaneous electrostimulation as the invasive electro- stimulation can deliver a higher concentration and more parallel distribution of electric field to a target site.", "type": "Document"}}
