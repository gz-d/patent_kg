In one exemplary embodiment, the support members 10a and 104 can extend from a proximal vertebra 6 to a distal vertebra 8 of the spine 2 and be secured thereonto. For example, the ends 16a and 18a, or 165 and 18d, of the support member 10a or 104 can be fixed to the proximal and distal vertebrae 6 and 8 by various securing elements 20, such as hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In one exemplary embodiment (not shown), the upper ends 16a and 164 of the support members 10a and 105 can be secured onto different proximal vertebrae. In another exemplary embodiment, each support member 10a or 104 can e secured to multiple sections of the deformed spine 2.\n\nIn one exemplary embodiment, at least one of the support members 10c and 104 can be formed of a superelastic or seudoelastic, or materials with similar properties. In an exemplary embodiment, both support members 10a and 105 can be made of a superelastic material. The superelastic sup- ort members 10a and 104 can be bent to form a bent portion 14a and 14h to fit into the deformed spine portion 4, such as shown in FIG. 3. The correction of spine deformities can be achieved by straightening the bent portions 14a and 146 ina coronal or sagittal plane. In an exemplary embodiment, the hump of the bent portions 14a and 14d can be positioned at the posterior side of the body. The bent portions 14a and 14 can be joined to the deformed spine potion 4 in various manners to apply the correction force thereto. In an embodi- ment, a plurality of anchor members 30 can be used to implant into one or more sections of the deformed spine portion 4 to join the same with the support members 10a and 106. The anchor members 30 can be locked either at the time of opera-", "type": "Document"}}
