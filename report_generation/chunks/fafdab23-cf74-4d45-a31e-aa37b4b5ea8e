The inductance of the inductor can be designed to limit the current through the LED module because the current ripple AI, -,can be expressed as:\n\nVour ~ Vip Aligy = Yaa We\n\nIn this way, the control circuit can use non-electrolytic capacitors without causing a large variation in the light output of the LED system. This concept can be implemented in existing electronic ballasts by replacing the electrolytic capacitors with other capacitors of lower values and re-de- signing the LED system so that the LED power variation falls within the peak luminous flux region in the luminous flux\u2014 LED power curve.\n\nwhere At is the time period during the current change.\n\nFrom the above equation, it can be seen that the size of inductor L can be used to reduce the current ripple, which turn can limit the change of total LED power because\n\nAPiep=ViepAliep\n\nAnother important aspect of the present invention involves the use of novel passive power circuits that can achieve the advantages proposed above without using active electronic switches. Without using active electronics switches, the pro- posed circuits do not need an electronic control circuit for the switches and can be much more reliable, long-lasting and have lower costs than their active electronic counterparts.", "type": "Document"}}
