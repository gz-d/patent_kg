It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications, including additions and/or substitutions may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Specific details may be omitted so as not to obscure the invention; however, the disclosure is written to enable one skilled in the art to practice the teachings herein without undue experimentation.\n\n[0040] The inventors devised that Public key cryptogra- phy provides data confidentiality and authenticity in modern digital communication systems. However, most widely used. public-key algorithms including RSA and ECC can be efficiently broken by running the Shor\u2019s algorithm on a guantum computer with a few thousand qubits. It has become necessary to find suitable alternative cryptosystems before the practical deployment of quantum computers. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a term to describe the set of cryptographic algorithms that are secure against quantum attacks.", "type": "Document"}}
