The mechanical properties include the elastic modulus of the whole cell (denoted as E), the elastic modulus of the nucleus (ie. nuclear modulus, E,,,,.7e2,) and the elastic modulus of the cytoplasm (i.e. cytoplasmic modulus, E,,,.). Notably, the system and method can be applied directly to unattached cells as well as a suspension cell, a non-adherent cell and a dissociated adherent cell. Additionally, the proposed system and method are also capable of cell mechanical properties quantification in blood samples. The system and method can also be applied directly to an extracted nucleus to calculate the elastic modulus of the extracted nucleus, considering that an extracted nucleus generally behaves as a homoge-\n\nneous soft sphere.\n\n[0058] The system and method involve examining an individual live whole cell captured along a microfluidic channel to obtain parameters of the cell when it is deformed under two different deformation levels. The cell deformation is achieved by driving a live whole cell along the microflu- idic channel at a constant pressure such that the cell is clamped by the narrowing sidewalls of the microfluidic channel. Different deformation levels can be achieved by varying the pressure applied to the cell through an inlet of the microfluidic channel.", "type": "Document"}}
