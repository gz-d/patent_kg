Flow Measurement\n\n[0071] In one embodiment, blood flow speed is deter- mined using a dual-pulse method/model or multiple-pulse method/model (uses at least two pulses) in one embodiment of the invention. In photoacoustic imaging or sensing, the earlier photoacoustic excitation may affect the amplitudes of the latter photoacoustic signals. This dependency can change due to one or more of: diffusion, temperature, and. flow. In the present embodiment, two or more photoacoustic signals with only sub-microseconds delay between adjacent signals is utilized for determining flow speed. The present embodiment hypothesizes that the blood flow can signifi- cantly affect the inter-pulse signal amplitude dependency in\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\na short time delay. In this embodiment the relationship between the dual-pulse or multiple-pulse amplitudes and the blood flow speed is modelled. After calibration, the flow speed can be measured or determined from a set of photoa- coustic measurements. The method in the present embodi- ment can be referred to as a dual-pulse flowmetric method.\n\n[0072] In the dual-pulse flowmetric method, two short- delayed nanosecond laser pulses are transmitted to the sample to excite two photoacoustic signals. The time delay between the two laser pulses is St. In linear range, the induced photoacoustic amplitudes Pi and Pa can be approxi- mated as\n\nPyekPonF bar\n\nPoh ot ADF ht day", "type": "Document"}}
