The optical sensing device includes a source unit configured to generate a polychromatic light beam containing p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam; an interferometric unit, configured to introduce bire- fringent retardation for generating optical path difference between the p-polarized beam and the s-polarized beam; a SPR sensing unit, configured to receive both p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam and induce a SPR effect to the p-polarized beam associated with a target sample; a detection unit, detecting target sample characteristics by obtaining an interference spectrum of the p-polarized beam and the s-po- larized beam from the SPR sensing unit.\n\nHereinafter, a detailed description to the appended drawings. will be given with", "type": "Document"}}
