The invention is particularly use- ful for use with any charging platform (such as that shown in WO003/105308 but not limited thereto) that provides mag- netic flux \u201cperpendicular\u201d to the charging surface, the entire area of the proposed device can be used to pick up the AC flux. For the same reason, the structure of the proposed device can be of low-profile (i.e. very thin, less than 1 mm), making it easy to mount the proposed planar device on the active side of the battery inside a battery pack without increasing the overall thickness of the battery pack substantially. This low-profile device can be used as a separate circuit to make existing batteries compatible with the planar inductive battery charger or can be integrated into new battery packs. The secondary resonant tank allows a relatively low switching frequency to be chosen so as to optimize the charging performance such as improved energy efficiency and energy transfer; reduced AC resistance and EMI emission. The proposed device can be added to existing battery pack externally or integrated into existing charging protection circuit inside the battery pack. If a voltage doubler is used as the diode rectifier, a high voltage\n\n11.
