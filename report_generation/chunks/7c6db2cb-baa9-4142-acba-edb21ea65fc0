The enzymes that catalyze the removal of lipoylation, so called \u201cerasers\u201d, are still poorly understood.\n\n[0067] Using immunoenrichment methods Cristea et al. discovered that the protein Sirt4 could interact with the PDH complex. The study revealed Sirt4 as the first mammalian enzyme that can modulate PDH activity through delipoy- lation in living cells. However, it was noted that the delipoy- lation activity of Sirt4 in vitro was rather weak, especially when compared with the deacetylation activity of sirtuins. The present invention seeks to identify a probe and a method for identifying other enzymes that can erase Klip in the native cellular environment.\n\n[0053] The invention may further provide a proteomic method of identifying specific mammalian proteins binding lipoylated lysine.\n\n[0054] The invention may further provide a kit of parts comprising a KPlip probe, a KPlip-C probe and a KPlip- comp probe.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0055] The invention is further described by means example but in any limitative sense with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1: Synthesis of KPlip\n\n[0056] FIG. 1a is the structure of KPlip;\n\n[0057] FIG. 1 is the structure of KPlip-C;\n\n[0068] Profiling the interaction between an enzyme and its substrate may be difficult, as their interactions are usually weak, transient, and dynamic. Affinity-based probes (Af- BPs) provide a powerful tool to overcome those hindrances by utilizing photo-crosslinking to convert transient protein- ligand interactions into covalent chemical linkages. Chemi- cal proteomics using AfBP s coupled to mass spectrometry is a robust strategy that facilitates elucidation of complex molecular mechanisms by studying protein-ligand interac- tions within signaling networks.\n\n[0058] FIG. Ic is the structure of a lipoylated peptide competitor;", "type": "Document"}}
