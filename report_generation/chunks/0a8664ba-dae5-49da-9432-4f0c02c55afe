Benefitting from the high content of Ni, both pristine and PGE-NCM811 mate- rials deliver high discharge capacities of 201.8 mAh gl and 203.8 mAh g 1, respectively. However, the capacity reten- tion of these two materials shows a clear contrast (FIG. 65): the discharge capacity of pristine NCM811 quickly drops to 63.5% over 80 cycles, whereas that of the inventive PGE- NCM811 is well retained with minimum loss (98% for 50 cycles and 92.3% for 80 cycles). Along with the remarkable capacity retention, the PGE-NCM811 material also exhibits better voltage stability over cycling, as presented in the charge-discharge polarization profiles (FIGS. 3c-3d). The much smaller impedance of the cycled PGE-NCM811 cell, measured by AC impedance spectra, proves the capacity and voltage retentions (FIGS. 9a-9h). Apparently, the formation of the gradient monoclinic grain surfaces improves the cyclic stability of PGE-NCM811, which could be attributed to the structural evolution during the charge-discharge pro- cesses. From the initial polarization curves, the broad peak at 3.7 V, which corresponds to the H1-H2 phase transition, is inhibited for PGE-NCM811. Moreover, the more harmful H2-H3 phase transition that occurs at around 4.2 V, ampli- fied by the differential capacity curves (dQ/dV, FIG. 6a inset), also becomes less obvious. These observations indi- cate that the PGE-NCMB811 material experiences a moderate structural which\n\nchange upon charge-discharge cycles, results in the enhanced cycling stability.\n\nApr. 14, 2022", "type": "Document"}}
