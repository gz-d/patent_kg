Nevertheless, in the primary-grain surfaces of PGE-NCM811, the regular octahedra may be distorted due to the higher oxidation states of Ni ions. Accordingly, pair distribution function (PDF), which is recognized to be more sensitive to the local structure than XRD, was extracted from the total X-ray scattering for both pristine and PGE-NCM811 materials. FIG. 15a compares the low-r PDF patterns for these two materials. The first peak, which corresponds to the TM-O bond length, shows a clear splitting feature for PGE- NCM811, in contrast to the symmetrical peak shape for pristine NCM811. This provides direct evidence of the distorted octahedra in the PGE material, which demonstrates the successful material synthesis and design of primary-\n\ngrain engineering.\n\n[0047] To distinguish the shorter and longer TM-O bonds in the distorted octahedron, full profile refinements of the PDF G(r) patterns were carried out (see Table 2). As seen in FIG. 154, the hexagonal R-3m model fits well to the pristine NCM811 data with an agreement factor (R,,) of 10.4%, but fails to describe the PDF patterns of PGE-NCM811, espe- cially for the first TM-O peak (R,,=15.3%). This failure is overcome by adopting the monoclinic model of C2/m (R,,=10.1%), in which the octahedra are allowed to distort without altering the layered framework.\n\nUS 2022/0115659 Al\n\nTABLE 2\n\na-axis c-axis R3m (A) (A) O- Pristine- 2.870 14.19 0240 10.4 NCM8I1 G) G) O) a-axis b-axis c-axis R.
