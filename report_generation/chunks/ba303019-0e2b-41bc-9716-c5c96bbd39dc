One or more of the barrier patterns can comprise mul- tiple modes, such as, for example, a transparent mode and a partially opaque mode, wherein the transparent mode can be selected when normal 2-D content is being processed and the partially opaque mode (e.g., partially opaque in the form of a repetitive pattern of columns of evenly spaced opaque vertical strips for use to process stereoscopic-type 3-D content; par- tially opaque in the form of a plurality of slanted opaque strips, which can be repetitive and/or regularly spaced, for use to process autostereoscopic-type 3-D content) can be selected when enhanced 2-D content is being processed to reconstruct a3-D scene, as more fully disclosed herein.\n\nIn yet another aspect, the barrier component 500 can include a voltage generator component 522 that can be use: by the switch component 516 to generate and apply a speci- fied voltage to electrodes associated with a barrier pattern to select a desired barrier pattern mode, wherein respective applied voltages can facilitate selection of respective barrier pattern modes of a barrier pattern. Different voltages applied to electrodes can correspond to different barrier patterns.", "type": "Document"}}
