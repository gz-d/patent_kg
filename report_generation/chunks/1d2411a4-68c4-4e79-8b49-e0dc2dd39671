The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a process of PQC standardization since 2017. The institute announced 17 public-key encryption and Key- establishment (PKE/KEM) schemes and 9 digital signature schemes in the round-1 evaluation. In July 2022, NIST announced the standardization of lattice based KEM CRYS- TALS-KYBER, two lattice based signatures CRYSTALS- Dilithium and Falcon, and one hash-based signature SPHINCS+.\n\n[0042] Lattice-based cryptography is based on the diffi- culty of computational lattice problems that cannot be solved efficiently. Examples of such problems include short- est vector problem (SVP), short integer solution problem (SIS), and the learning with error problem (LWE). The SIS problem is to find a short vector s such that A-s=0, given the matrix A. The LWE is to find the vector s from b=A-s+e, given the matrix A and the vector b, where e is the hidden error vector. The Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems define the matrix A over polynomial ring so it can be obtained under the rotational shift operation of a vector a. This design provides more compactness and efficacy because there is no need to store the large matrix A and the calculation of A-s can be accelerated by using the number theoretic transforms (NTT). The Module-SIS (MSIS) and Module-LWE (MLWE) replace the single ring elements (a and s) with the module elements over the same ring. The trade-offs between. security and efficiency are adjustable.", "type": "Document"}}
