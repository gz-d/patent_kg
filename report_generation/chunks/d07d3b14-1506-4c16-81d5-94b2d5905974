Interestingly, these participants also tended to show a weaker gaze cascade effect. These findings demonstrate the importance taking individual differences into account in the understanding of human decision-making behavior. Importantly, while regular HMMs without cognitive state transitions in EMHMM approach could also account for individual differences in eye movement patterns, the accuracy in inferring participants\u2019 preference choices using EMSHMM is surprisingly and significantly higher than that using EMHMM. Advantageously, EMSHMM can better capture the cognitive processes involved in the task and consequently lead to higher inference\n\nof\n\nan\n\naccuracy.\n\nFurther advantageously, the instant methods can deduce participants\u2019 preference during a decision making process from eye gaze transition information alone. In contrast, previous methods needed to combine eye movement measures with other information such as additional physiological measures or attended visual features including integrated skin conductance, blood volume pulse, pupillary response.", "type": "Document"}}
