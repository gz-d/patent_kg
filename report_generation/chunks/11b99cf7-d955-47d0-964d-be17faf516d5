As the metasurface structure 402 may manipulate or control all of these properties of electromag- netic waves, the metasurface antenna 400 may be referred to as a universal metasurface antenna 400. In this example, the metasurface structure 402 may independently, simultane- ously, and dynamically manipulate or control two or more of the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momen- tum of electromagnetic waves for radiation. In one example, each of the plurality of subwavelength units may be selec- tively operable in a first operation state and a second. operation state (e.g., a radiating state and a non-radiating state, or a stronger radiating state and a weaker radiating state) to facilitate manipulation or control of the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of elec-\n\ntromagnetic waves.\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\n[0135]\n\nAs shown in FIG. 4A, the subwavelength units are\n\ngenerally aligned to form an array, and they have generally the same construction. Specifically, each of the subwave- length units respectively includes: two generally rectangular loop-shaped slots etched in the upper electrically conductive layer of the substrate integrated waveguide 404, two PIN diodes operably coupled with one of the generally rectan- gular loop-shaped slots, and two other PIN diodes operably coupled with another one of the generally rectangular loop- shaped slots. The PIN diodes operably coupled with the corresponding rectangular loop-shaped slot may facilitate control of operation of the slot selectively in a radiating state (in which it radiates electromagnetic waves) and a non- radiating state (in which it does not radiate electromagnetic\n\nwaves).
