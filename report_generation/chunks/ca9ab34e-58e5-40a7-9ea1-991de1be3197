With reference to FIG, 2A, the polymeric layer and the hydrogel may form at least a first crosslinked structure defined by the plurality of polymer chains of the first polymeric material and the third polymeric material forming at least one cova- lent bond at a bonding site 220 between the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the first and the third polymeric materials 218, 202.\n\n[0177] In this example, the polymeric layer is an elasto- meric layer comprising PDMS (i.e. the first polymeric material). The PDMS chains is arranged to form at least one covalent bond with the hydrogel, forming a first crosslinked structure. The hydrogel includes a polymer matrix having a second crosslinked structure and a third crosslinked struc- ture. Each of the crosslinked structures are defined by a plurality of polymer chains of polyacrylamide (PAAm) (i.e. the second polymeric material) or alginate (i.e. the third polymeric material).
