In the measurement test, when one of the TE port and the TM port was under test, the other one of the TE port and the TM port was loaded with a 50-Q load resistor. FIG. 4 compares the measured and simulated radia- tion patterns at 2.44 GHz. With reference to FIG. 4A, an omnidirectional radiation pattern can be observed for the TE port. In both of the E- and H-planes, the co-polar fields are higher than the cross-polar fields by at least 15 dB, which is acceptable for practical applications. For the TM port, omnidirectional radiation pattern can also be seen in FIG. 4B. As shown in FIG. 4B, a 15-dB difference between the co-polar and cross-polar fields can be observed in the E-plane. However, the measured cross-polarization gets larger in the H-plane. This is likely due to the measurement problem, and it is envisaged that this problem can be solved. ameliorated balun.\n\n[0050] The measured and simulated realized gains of the prototype are shown in FIG. 5. As shown in FIG. 5, the measured and simulated realized gains for the TE port are 1.3 dBi and 2.4 dBi at 2.44 GHz, respectively. Also, within the 2.4-GHz WLAN band, the measured gain is around 0.8 dBi, and the simulated one is around 2.2 dBi. For the TM port, the measured and simulated realized gains at 2.44 GHz are 2.0 dBi and 0.6 dBi, respectively, and they are in turn higher than 1.6 dBi and 0.4 dBi within the WLAN band, respectively.", "type": "Document"}}
