In one example, the cathode may be a MnO, cathode and the active material MnO, is electrodeposited onto a SS mesh. The electrodeposition may be carried out in a three-electrode cell. In operation, the SS mesh may be used as a working electrode while a zinc metal foil (purity>99.99%, Suzhou TanFeng Technology Co., Ltd.) may be used as both counter and reference electrodes. An aqueous solution containing for example 2 mol L~' of ZnSO, and 0.2 mol L~' MnSO, (AR grade,\n\n[0182] The polymeric layer encapsulates the hydrogel by forming the first crosslinked structure defined by the PDMS chains and the PAAm chains forming at least one covalent bond between the PDMS chains and the PAAm chains. Preferably, the PDMS chains are functionalized with TEOVS (ce. first coupling agent) whereas the PAAm chains are functionalized with TMSPMA (ie. second coupling agent)such that the PDMS chains can couple with the PAAm chains through the reaction between TEOVS and TMSPMA. In particular, the alkoxy groups of the TEOVS and the TMSPMA are hydrolysed to silanol groups and condensate with each other by forming siloxane bonds therebetween. Any molecules along the PDMS chain and the PAAm chain\n\n[0187] Sigma) may be used as the electrolyte. The three- electrode cell may be galvanostatically charged to a prede- termined voltage (e.g. 1.8 V vs Zn/Zn**) under a predeter- mined current density (e.g. 0.2 mA cm7*). The voltage may be maintained by a predetermined of time such as 8 h using am electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D). After that, the MnO, cathode may be dried at an elevated temperature such as in a vacuum oven with a temperature of 80\u00b0 C.\n\na\n\nJan. 14 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0013551 A1\n\n10\n\nstructure .
