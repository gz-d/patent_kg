The electronic circuit comprises a capacitor, means for sensing a voltage signal across the capacitor, means for determining from the sensed. voltage signal and a value of a series parasitic effect associ- ated with the capacitor a parasitic voltage associated with the capacitor, and a voltage source in series with the capacitor, the voltage source being adapted to deliver a compensating volt- age of generally equal magnitude but generally opposite phase to the determined parasitic voltage.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS", "type": "Document"}}
