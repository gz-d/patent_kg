Preferably, the Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 Im base alloy comprises 14% of Sn, 39% of Bi and 47% of In by weight.\n\n[0059] Alternatively or in addition, the Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base alloy may further comprise an additional element. Examples of the additional elements suitable for being included in the present alloy include, but are not limited to, Pb, Zn, and Ag. According to preferred embodiments of the present disclo- sure, the element is Pb, and the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In\u2014Pb alloy consists essentially of 11-15% Si, 35-40% Bi, 39-52% of In, and 2-6% of Pb by weight.\n\nthe solder\n\nIn", "type": "Document"}}
