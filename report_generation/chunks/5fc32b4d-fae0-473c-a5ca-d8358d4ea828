It comprises of an active voltage source that generates a voltage counteracting the voltages across the parasitic inductance and resistance, so that the effect caused by the inductance and resistance can be suppressed, reduced. or canceled. The magnitude of the active voltage source is derived by sensing the capacitor current. The frequency response of the capacitor will be enhanced with the induc- tance and resistance suppressed.\n\nIn accordance with another main aspect of the invention, there is provided an electronic circuit or system. The elec- tronic circuit or system comprises means for determining a value of a series parasitic effect associated with a part of the electronic circuit or system that exhibits capacitance, means for sensing a voltage signal across the part of the electronic circuit or system, means for determining from the sensed voltage signal and the value of the series parasitic effect, a parasitic voltage associated with the part of the electronic circuit or system, and a voltage source in series with the part of the electronic circuit or system, the voltage source being adapted to deliver a compensating voltage of generally equal magnitude but generally in opposite phase to the determined\n\nIn another general aspect of the invention, some other forms of non-isolated and isolated structures can be derived. The capacitor current can be sensed and the output voltage be generated by non-isolated and isolated means.", "type": "Document"}}
