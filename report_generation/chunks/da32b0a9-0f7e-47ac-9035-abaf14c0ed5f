FIGURE 9B shows the average inference accuracies of the two groups using different window lengths starting from the beginning of the trial (note that participants had different trial lengths, with the average length 5.65+2.57 seconds; Group A had average trial length 7.07+2.32 seconds, while Group B had average trial length of 3.9341.13 seconds).
