In this example, the mag- netic dipole moment is used as the weight coefficient in array factor calculation. In this example, each meta-atom can be viewed as two +45\u00b0-inclined magnetic dipoles, whose radi- ating far-field can be expressed as\n\n_ 2 (sb HO) =\u2014 \u4e0b wow\n\nwhere 6 is the observation direction with respect to the surface normal of the metasurface. The pattern of the meta-atom is modeled as a cosine function cos 8. By substituting equations (4) and (7) into (SL), the following can be obtained:\n\n$2) BHfoPo Se selmi f+ fig?
