To evaluate the performance of the hybrid soft-\n\nware/hardware Processor, an example system was integrated and implemented on the Xilinx ZedBoard with the Zynq- 7020 device inside. Apart from the reconfigurable logic, ZedBoard has an on-chip ARM Cortex-A9 processor run- ning at 667 MHz with a 512 MB DDR memory. Four hardware modules were integrated into the reconfigurable logic and the software is run on the ARM processor. In this design, Vivado 2020.2 is used for the synthesis and imple- mentation while the whole software/hardware system is evaluated using Vitis 2020.2. The hardware resource usage after place and route are shown in Table 5. The HW_ACC_ IP is the integration of the four modules while the PL_HW_ system integrates all hardware modules on the PL, including the HW_ACC_IP, AXI-DMA, AX] interconnection, system. clock, and the concat module. The maximum working\n\nfrequency of the PL_HW_system reaches 150 MHz, which\n\nUS 2024/0143524 Al\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n13\n\nis\n\nlower than the individual modules. This is because of the logic congestion during place and route introduces longer wiring paths.\n\n[0117] Note that the integrated HW_ACC_IP uses approximately 6.7% less LUT than the sum of the individual modules. This is because hardware resource reuse technique is applied during the system integration. To be more specific, the modular reduction units are shared between the hybrid NTT/INTT module and the PWM module, thus 4 DSPs instead of 6 are used in the HW_ACC_IP. The BRAMs used by the hybrid NIT/INTT, PWM, and PWA modules are also shared thus only 6.5 BRAMs are deployed in the HW_AC- C_IP.", "type": "Document"}}
