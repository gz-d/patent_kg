In operation there is a charge transfer between the anode 102 and the cathode 104 in order to convert chemical energy to electrical energy. The anode 102 and the cathode 104 are preferably being flexible. The anode 102 and cathode 104 are arranged in a suitable arrangement depending on the desired shape of the battery 100.\n\n[0131] In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an electrical energy storage device that may be operable with stable electro- chemical performance under various harsh conditions such as under ice or boiling water. The device may also be capable of physically deforming upon subjecting to an external mechanical load such as folding, rolling, twisting, and the like. The device may include a pair of electrodes and\n\n[0137] With reference to FIG. 1A, the anode 102 com- prises a substrate 108 with a metal or metal compound 114 disposed on the substrate 108. The substrate 108 may be of any suitable material. In one example the substrate 108 is a stainless steel (SS) mesh.
