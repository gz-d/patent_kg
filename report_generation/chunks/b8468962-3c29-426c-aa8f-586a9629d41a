Accordingly, for an exemplary single- element 102 SPA resting on a 20x20 square centimeters (cm?) flat ground plane, for example, as described above regarding FIGS. 1-2, the exemplary single-element 102 SPA can be simulated and/or optimized using Ansoft\u2122 HFSS\u2122. In addi- tion, experimental measurements can be acquired using an Agilent\u00ae 8753 network analyzer to verify simulations.\n\nof GA 500, one or more solar cell panel(s) 502 can be fixed in a suspended position above the U-shaped concave ground 504 at a distance of H 518 using a holder (e.g., a polyvinyl- chloride (pve) holder) (not shown) at an approximate height of H (518)=47 centimeters (cm) above ground plane 504 as depicted. According to various implementations, H 518 can be determined (e.g., experimentally or otherwise) by optimiz- ing output of the one or more solar cell panel(s) 502. As described above, both single-element(s) 102 SPA and ground plane 504 can advantageously reflect incident light 522 to one or more appropriately positioned solar cell(s) 502 to increase output voltage of an associated solar power generating sys- tem.", "type": "Document"}}
