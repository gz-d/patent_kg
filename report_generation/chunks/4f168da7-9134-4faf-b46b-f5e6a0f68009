This\n\nUS 2021/0066789 Al\n\nMar. 4, 2021\n\nAs shown in FIG. 2, the antenna 200 includes, generally: dielectric block 202 with a groove 206 arranged on ground plane 204, and a conductor 208 arranged in the groove 206.\n\n(FIG. 1A). The conductor strip 110 is arranged to receive an excitation signal (e.g., from a SMA connector 112 that extends through a through-hole 104A in the ground plane 104) to operate the antenna 100 as the dielectric resonator antenna. The conductor strip 110 may be a generally vertical inverted trapezoidal strip having a vertical height L., a base width W.5, and a top width Ws wider than the base width Ws. This trapezoidal configuration may improve imped- ance match of the dielectric resonator antenna. In another embodiment, the conductor strip 110 may be a generally rectangular strip (when W,,=W,,).\n\nTABLE I\n\nDimensions of the Dual-Frequency Antenna Parameter le Wo lyn W Ly d Ho Value 100 24 2 15 5 72 4 (mm) Parameter Hy He Hs Hy, Ly Ws We Value 20 10 28 05 28 2 2 (mm) Parameter ls Lp \u00ae% % 8 % & Value 105 28 49 19 127 49 10 (mm)", "type": "Document"}}
