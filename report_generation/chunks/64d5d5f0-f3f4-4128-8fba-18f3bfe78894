The electronic fabric includes a hydrophobic nanofiber layer, a superhydrophilic nanofiber layer and a conductive layer. Particularly, the conductive layer is located between the hydrophobic nanofiber layer and the superhydrophilic nanofiber layer, forming a multilayer composite structure so as to realize the conductive and electronic sensing function and generate a surface energy gradient and a push-pull effect to guide moisture unidirectionally. Moreover, the biomi- metic, nanofiber-based and directional moisture-wicking wearable electronic fabric has a pressure sensing sensitivity of 75 to $50 kPa\u201c! in a pressure range from 0 to 20 kPa and a water vapor transfer rate between 12-18 kg-m7?-d7! at 25\u00b0\n\nCc.", "type": "Document"}}
