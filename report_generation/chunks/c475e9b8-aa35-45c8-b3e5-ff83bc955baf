The front-stage power converter controls its output voltage (Vdc) by varying the duty-cycle of the converter switch. Typically, a pulse-width modulation (PWM) tech- nique is used to control the duty-cycle of the converter switch, which in turn, controls the output voltage of the power con- verter. The duty-cycle function is denoted as M(d) in FIG. 1. The first-stage power converter that provides a controllable DC-link voltage (Vdc) can be controlled either in \u201cvoltage control\u201d mode or in \u201ccurrent control\u201d mode.\n\nThe second-stage power inverter adopts a fixed frequency control. Generally, the diagonal pairs of switches in the full- bridge inverter are switched together and the two pairs are switched in a complementary manner so that an AC voltage can be generated at the output of the inverter. If necessary, a small dead time can be introduced in the switching instants of the two switches in the same inverter leg in order to achieve soft switching, thus reducing the switching loss and EMI radiation. The inverter is switched at a constant frequency, which should preferably be the same as the resonant fre- quency of the resonant tank in the primary circuit. Since the current fed from the first-stage power converter is kept con- stant, the second-stage inverter generates a fixed-frequency constant AC current into the winding(s) of an active group. The fixed-frequency operation is important because the sec- ondary circuits of the electronic loads will be designed to receive power transfer at this frequency. This frequency should preferably be chosen so that the radiated electromag- netic interference (EMI) should not violate international elec- (EMC)", "type": "Document"}}
