The transfor- mation can take place instantaneously or over a period of time from several minutes to days. The correction force generated by such a superelastic or pseudoelastic ma- terial can maintain a constant or substantially constant level when such a superelastic or pseudoelastic material is subject to deformation within the range of the elastic limit and the plastic limit of the material. The spinal de- formity correction can be carried out in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, spinal deformities can be completely corrected at the time of operation. In another exemplary embodiment, spinal deformities can be grad- ually corrected both during and after the operation. For example, a constant or substantially constant correction force can be applied to a deformed spine portion subse- quent to the surgery, allowing a gradual correction of the spinal deformities without inducing neurological prob- lems or compromise of the implant-bone interface. [0022] Additionally or alternatively, the spinal deformity correction can be carried out with or without the need for further manipulation. In an exemplary embodiment, a constant or substantially constant and controllable force can be applied to the deformed spine portion with post- operation manipulation.
