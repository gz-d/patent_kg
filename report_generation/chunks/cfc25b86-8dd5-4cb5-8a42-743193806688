The purpose of carrying out an ICT rather than a DCT is to reduce the computation complexity, because the core transform of the ICT can be realized by shift and addition operations only without multiplication. The quantization process of Z\u2014Q(F) for the transformed residual block F can be expressed as a rounding operation on each coefficient of F:\n\nThe practical implementation of the DCT and quantization process in H.264/AVC is a little bit different from Equation 9 and its architecture is shown in FIG. 2. The DCT is imple- mented by ICT with scaling factors for complexity reduction (See A. Hallapuro, M. Karezewicz, \u201cLow Complexity Trans- form and Quantization\u201d, in Joint Video Team (JVT) of ISO/ IEC MPEG and ITU-T VCEG, Doc. JVT-B038 and JVT- B039, January 2002., which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n(EQUATION 16)\n\nwhere z,, and f,, are coefficients of the quantized transform and unquantized transform blocks of Z and F, respectively. A is the quantization step size, which is determined by the QP factor (the quantized step size). On the other hand, the inverse quantization process of F=Q-'(Z) can be expressed as an operation on each coefficients of Z:\n\nIn simple terms the ICT is an integer transform which is computationally easier to calculate than a DCT because unlike a DCT, all of its coefficients are integers. Therefore many division and/or floating point operations are avoided and the ICT may be realized by shift and addition operations only. Prior to quantization, scaling factors are applied to make the ICT equivalent to a DCT.\n\n(EQUATION 17)", "type": "Document"}}
