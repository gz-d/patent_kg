The 3D focus-steering antenna includes a first discrete dielectric lens (DDL) 1, a second discrete dielectric lens 2 (DDL 2) and a feed horn 3. The feed horn 3 is connected to a metallic waveguide to assure the compatibility of the focus-steering antenna and the standard terahertz components since some existing terahertz systems are waveguide-based. Both of the two lenses can be in-plane rotated along their centrosymmetric axes independently and the upper lens 2 can also move along the z-direction.\n\n[0030] An antenna fixture 4 with four vertical posts is used to support and assemble the lens pair and the feed horn. The in-plane rotation mechanism is similar to that used for Risley prisms. But different from Risley prisms, which are used for far-field beam scanning, the present invention is applied to near-field focus steering applications. An example of rotation stages is depicted in FIGS. 1(a)-1(6). A rotation stage for the lower DDL (DDL 1) is shown as stage 5 while a rotation stage for the upper DDL (DDL 2) is shown as stage 6. A translation stage 7 provides separation between DDL 1 and DDL 2 through movement of DDL 2 in the z direction. Typically, independent drive motors are used to rotate the lenses while an additional motor changes the spacing along the z-axis between the lenses. For example, rotation and translation can be performed using commer- cially available rotation and translation stages, such as STANDA Rotator 8MRB240 and STANDA Motorized\n\nDec. 9, 2021\n\nDelay Line 8MT160-300. However, it is understood that mechanism may be used for translation and rotation of lenses.\n\nany the\n\nThe first DDL 1 transforms a spherical phase front\n\n[0031]", "type": "Document"}}
