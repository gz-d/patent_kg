The cap is arranged to be in contact with the planar charging surface and to support the electrical device on the planar charging surface during charging of the electrical device, and the secondary winding is arranged to be substantially parallel to the planar charging surface so that lines of magnetic flux extending from the planar charging surface pass substantially perpendicularly through the sec-", "type": "Document"}}
