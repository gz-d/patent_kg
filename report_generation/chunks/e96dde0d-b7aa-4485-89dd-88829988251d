The ground plane 108 is operably connected with the feeding network 106. A microstrip line network 110, formed by metal (e.g., copper), is arranged at the base of the second substrate layer 104B, on a side opposite the ground plane 108. The microstrip line network 110 is operably connected with the feeding network 106 and with the ground plane. A cylindrical feed probe 112, with a radius r, extends through the first and second substrate layers 104A, 1048, and is arranged to operably connect the feeding network 106 and the microstrip line network 110.\n\n[0030] FIG. 1B is a cross sectional view of the dielectric resonator antenna of FIG. 1A (taken along line A-A of FIG.\n\n[0031] FIG. 1C is a top view of the substrate assembly dielectric resonator antenna of FIG. 1A;\n\n[0032] FIG. 1D is a bottom view of the substrate assembly of the dielectric resonator antenna of FIG. 1A;\n\n[0033] FIG. 2A is a photo showing a top view of substrate assembly of a dielectric resonator antenna proto- in one embodiment of the invention;\n\n[0034] FIG. 2B is a photo showing a bottom view of the substrate assembly of FIG. 2A;\n\n[0043] Referring now to FIG. 1A to 1D, the feeding network 106 includes a first network portion arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element 102 to produce the first linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern at TM, mode.
