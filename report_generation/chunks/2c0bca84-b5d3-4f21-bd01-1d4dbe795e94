In the preferred. TCAM design, the pipeline memory structure may be divided into two pipeline stages, separated from each other using pipeline registers. Referring to FIG. 7, the redundant FFs of each LUT-FF pair are used as pipeline registers.\n\n[0060] In another example, with reference to FIG. 6, expansion in both directions may be performed to create the desired size configuration of TCAM on FPGAs. For example, a formation of 128x12 TCAM 600 may be obtained using four D-CAM blocks 602 connected in both parallel and cascade form. Similarly, by further expanding the TCAM structure, a D-TCAM of size 512x144 may be emulated using 192 D-CAM blocks connected in parallel and cascade form.\n\n[0069] In addition, the memory device saves the informa- tion about the presence of input search key as well as the address where it is found in LUTRAMs in an efficient way to reduce the number of SRAM cells per TCAM bit com- pared to other LUTRAM-based TCAMs. Similarly, the redundant FFs are used as pipeline registers to divide the TCAM design into two stages which improved the through- put.\n\n[0061] As discussed above, FPGA\u2019s hardware compo- nents may be utilized in the form of slices (or CLBs), BRAMs, DSP blocks, and I/O blocks to synthesize any digital design. Preferably, LUTs and FFs may be arranged as LUT-FF pair inside the slices. They may not be used independently. For example, if a digital design requires 200 LUTs but not any FF, the synthesizer will still assign 50 slices to it, which contains FFs as well. In this example, the 200 FFs are utilized (synthesized/inferred) by the digital design but are not used, which is a wastage of area in FPGA.", "type": "Document"}}
