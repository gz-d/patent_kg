In still another aspect, the sys- tem 2000 can include zero-crossing controller component 2028, zero-crossing controller component 2030, and zero- crossing controller component 2032 that can comprise addi- tional circuitry and components that can respectively facili- tate at least partially controlling respective comparators (e.g., CP,, CP, and CP) in the low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, and thereby respectively associated power switches 2008, 2010, and 2012, by providing a small positive voltage signal to the non-inverting inputs of comparators to facilitate turning off the corresponding switches 2008, 2010, and 2012 (e.g., power MOSFETs) at desired times at or near", "type": "Document"}}
