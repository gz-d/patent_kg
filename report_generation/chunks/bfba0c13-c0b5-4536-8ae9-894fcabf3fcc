The imaging apparatus includes an electron gun arranged to provide electron beam to scan a specimen, and the deflector. The deflector is arranged to move the electron beam in a first scanning direction and a second scanning direction that are in the same plane for scanning the speci- men. The control unit is configured to determine the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction, and process the determined first scanning direction and the determined second scanning direction based on predeter- mined equations. The control unit is further configured to provide, based on the processing, a control signal to the deflector to adjust one or both of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction such that they become substantially orthogonal.\n\n(72) Inventors: Fu-Rong Chen, Kowloon (HK), Pei-En Li, Hsinchu City (TW): Ying-Shuo Tseng, Hsinchu City (TW)\n\n(21) Appl.
