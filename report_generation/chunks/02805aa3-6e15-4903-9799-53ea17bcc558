An electromagnetic actuation system for generating a gradient-enhanced magnetic field in a workspace, the system comprising one or more pairs of electromagnetic devices, each electromagnetic device including an elongated sleeve that defines a hollow space and has an external surface, an electric coil wounded onto the external surface of the elongated sleeve, a magnetic core, and actuation means for actuating a relative movement between the magnetic core and the elongated sleeve, the magnetic core having a first end, a second end, and a middle portion that is disposed between the first end and the second end and received in the hollow space, the second end being coupled to the actuation means,\n\nwherein the electromagnetic devices are configured to activated such that the gradient-enhanced magnetic field is generated in the workspace,\n\nwherein the relative movement between the magnetic and the elongated sleeve for one or more of the elec- tromagnetic devices modifies the workspace.\n\n10. The electromagnetic actuation system of claim 9, wherein the magnetic core includes a core tip disposed at the first end, and the core tip is shaped substantially as a cone and has a non-zero cone radius.\n\n11. The electromagnetic actuation system of claim 9, further comprising a magnetic frame, the magnetic frame including a top base, a bottom base, and a plurality magnetic bridges bridging the top base and the bottom base.\n\n12. The electromagnetic actuation system of claim wherein the magnetic bridges include a material selected from a group consisting of DT4E, low carbon steel, pure iron, and cast iron.\n\n13. The electromagnetic actuation system of claim 11, wherein each magnetic bridge includes a first section, a second section, and a middle section disposed between the first section and the second section,", "type": "Document"}}
