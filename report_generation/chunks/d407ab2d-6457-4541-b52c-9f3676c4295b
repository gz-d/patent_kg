In contrast, Group A\u2019s inference accuracy increased slowly, became above chance-level at around 6 seconds, and saturated at around 10 seconds.

According to FIGURE 7, participants started to show a tendency of looking at the chosen side more often at around 2 seconds before response. Thus, the accuracy of inferring participants\u2019 preferences was examined using the fixations during the last 2 seconds before the response.
