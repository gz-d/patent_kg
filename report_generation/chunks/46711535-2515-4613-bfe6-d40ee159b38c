For instance, the electrolyte may further include an additive that may alter the size of the nanoparticles 22 forming the nano-structured metallic layer 20. The additive may be acid, or metal salts. For instance, the cations of the metal salts may be Cu**, Ni?*, Co?*, Fe**, or Fe** and the anions of the metal salts may be NO,~, SO,\u00b0>, CI\u2019, or Br-. The additive may also be water soluble polymer e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), or other compounds such as sodium salts e.g. citrate sodium, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), polysalts e.g. polystyrene sulfonate, or cysteine.\n\n[0066] When a SAN 10 with a small content of Cu is subjected to the electrochemical treatment and cycled under galvanostatic mode i. constant current, for instance, between 20 mA (I,) and -20 mA (I,) with dwell time of several seconds for over 100 cycles, in an aqueous solution of 0.05 M citric acid, ultralong ordered Cu nanowires 23 as depicted in FIG. 1d are formed on the surface of the SAN 10.\n\n[0060] In each cycle, the metallic atoms of the metallic structure 10 are first oxidized to metallic ions 12 and released from the surface of the metallic structure 10 during oxidation stage. In the same cycle, the released metallic ions 12 are then reduced to metallic atoms 22 and form the nano-structured metallic layer 20 at the surface of the metallic structure 10 during reduction stage.\n\n[0067] Optionally, various Ag nanoparticles, such as Ag nanocubes 31, nanopyramids 32, nanospheres 33, nanocones as depicted in the SEM images of FIG. le may also be obtained by centrifugation of resultant electrolytes after the electrochemical treatment.", "type": "Document"}}
