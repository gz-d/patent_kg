Power loss of the diode bridge is P,,,=2V,1. For MOSFET IPW60RO45CP, Rose =0.045Q. The power loss of the SDSR is approximately Pa P2RystonytRs) when the power losses of gate-drives, which can be relatively negligible, are ignored.\n\nFIG. 18 illustrates a diagram of an example graph 1800 of example results relating to power loss of the disclosed SDSR (e.g., of system 200) and the conventional diode rectifier under the mains operations of 110V (up to 1 kW output power) and 220V (up to 2 kW output power), in an aspect. As shown in the graph 1800, at 1 kW and 110V operation, the SDSR can achieve approximately 52% power loss reduction as compared to the diode bridge. At 2 kW and 220V opera- tion, the SDSR can achieve power loss reduction of approxi- mately 57% as compared to the diode bridge.\n\nFIG. 19 depicts a diagram of a graph 1900 of the measured calculated power losses versus the input current. As seen in the graph 1900, the calculated power loss curves substantially correspond with the measurements.\n\nThe subject specification can employ a SDSR (e.g., self- driven AC-DC synchronous rectifier) that can be employed replace a diode bridge as a general-purpose AC-DC rectifier.\n\nand\n\nrelate\n\nresults when the\n\ncapacitive-resistive load, for example, as shown in FIG. 11.
