For example, flexible electronics may be used in wearable electronic device components and devices (i.e. wearable electronics), which may include smart fabric materials in the wearable electronics. Preferably, devices including garments made with smart fabrics may be used ina variety of applications such as healthcare to replace bulky instruments and bulky electronic components.\n\n[0105] FIG. 21C is a plot of capacity retention against bending cycles of the AD-battery 1400 being bent at 180\u00b0.\n\n[0106] FIG. 22A is a plot of voltage against specific capacity showing GCD curves of the AD-battery 1400 being immersed in water for different period of time.\n\n[0107] FIG. 22B is a plot of capacity retention against soaking time of the AD-battery 1400 being immersed in solution of blue ink.\n\n[0125] One example of an energy storage device for flexible/wearable electronics is zinc-ion battery (ZIB) which may include advantages such as having much less toxic and. flammable materials therein as compared with lithium-ion batteries, therefore may have much less safety and/or health concern to users. ZIB may also be low cost for scaling up as a result of the water-free and/or oxygen-free environment for assembling the battery. In addition, ZIB may have a high specific capacity as a result of multiple electron transfer and a low redox potential of Zn?*/Zn.\n\n[0108] FIG. 22C is a plot of capacity retention against soaking time of the AD-battery 1400 being immersed in solution of beer, soda or redberry juice.", "type": "Document"}}
