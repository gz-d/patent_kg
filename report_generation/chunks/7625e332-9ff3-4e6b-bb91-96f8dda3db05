The electrolytic solution may include at least one salt, in particular a metal salt, or an acid or an anti-freezing agent as additives within the electrolytic solution. In one example, the at least one salt, acid, anti-freezing agent may further function as a cross- linking agent for the covalent and/or ionic crosslinked structures. Preferably, the electrolytic solution may include zinc(II) sulphate (ZnSO,), manganese(II) sulphate (MnO,), Li,SO, and/or H,PO,. A skilled person may recognize any other electrolytic solutions including suitable salts or acids according to their needs.\n\n[0169] The polymeric layer 201 may comprise a plurality of polymer chains of the first polymeric material 218 or PDMS forming at least one covalent and/or physical cross- ink defining a chemical and/or physical crosslinked struc- ture. For example, the molecules of each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the first polymeric material may be chemically crosslinked by one or more covalent bonds ormed directly between molecules in each of the polymer chains of the first polymeric material 218.\n\n[0176] Referring to FIG. 2A, there is shown an example structure of electrolyte 106 illustrating the crosslinked struc- tures within the electrolyte. As mentioned above, the elec- trolyte 106 comprises a hydrogel including a polymer matrix having at least two crosslinked structures. The electrolyte also comprises a polymeric layer forming at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel such that the hydro- gel is substantially encapsulated by the polymeric layer.\n\n[0170] Additionally, the polymer chains of the first poly- meric material 218 may be physically crosslinked with each other by intertwining as well as intercrossing with each other, forming an additionally physically crosslinked struc- ture.", "type": "Document"}}
