In particular, random effects are added to the emission density means and to the log-probabilities of the transition matrix and prior. This allows inter-subject or inter-trial differences to be represented in a single model. Thus, In some embodiments of the invention the SHMM are extended to add random effects to model inter-subject differences in single model.\n\na\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n44\n\nIn summary, in some embodiments, the novel EMSHMM-based methods of the instant invention analyze eye movement data in tasks that involve cognitive state changes where for each participant an SHMM is used to capture between cognitive state transitions during the task, with eye movement patterns during each cognitive state being summarized using an HMM.\n\nembodiments, the EMSHMM of the invention 1s applied to\n\nface preference\n\nIn\n\nsome a decision-making task. In specific embodiments, the EMSHMM of the invention identifies two common eye movement patterns from the participants, where one pattern entered the preference-biased cognitive state later, showed a stronger gaze cascade effect immediately before the decision response, and allowed the determination of the preference decision later a trial and the other pattern revealed the preference decision much earlier in a trial, spent more time in the preference-biased cognitive state, had a weaker gaze cascade effect in the and led lower decision inference\n\nin\n\nend,\n\nto a\n\nresponse\n\naccuracy.\n\nThese surprising differences emerged naturally as the result of clustering based on", "type": "Document"}}
