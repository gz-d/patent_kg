A dielectric resonator antenna, comprising:\n\nnas can be for polarization diversity. By using one resonator only, cost and size can be effectively reduced as compared with for spatial diversity. The low isolation and correlation of the antennas is suited for use in polarization diversity. The dielectric resonator antennas in the above embodiments employ two different dielectric resonator modes and have two omnidirectional radiation patterns, which is desirable for, e.g. indoor communications. The solid dielectric reso- nator element can be made and assembled easily and cheaply. The dielectric resonator antennas, being linearly polarized antennas, can be easily integrated with various communication devices. Particularly suitable is indoor com- munications device, which often require linearly polarized antenna instead of circularly polarized antenna (that will only receive a maximum of a half the radiated energy). some examples, the dielectric resonator element can made with commercially-available glass, which can be inte- grated with kinds of devices, such as light cover, mirror, decoration, and other optical-transparent devices. When transparent or translucent material is used, the antenna can be easily integrated with different optical devices, e.g. light cover. The material and the shape of the dielectric resonator element can be chosen arbitrarily depending on application,\n\na dielectric resonator element; and\n\na substrate assembly attached to the dielectric resonator element;\n\nwherein the substrate assembly comprising a feeding network arranged to:\n\nfeed the dielectric resonator element to produce a linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern at a first resonant mode; and\n\nfeed the dielectric resonator element to produce second linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern at a second resonant mode different from first resonant mode.", "type": "Document"}}
