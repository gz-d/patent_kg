To dem- onstrate this, the far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna 400 are obtained. In each of the plots in FIG. 10, three radiating cases with different magnitudes are given to demonstrate the independent amplitude con- trollability. The plots in the same row in FIG. 10 represent the radiated propagating waves with identical wave proper- ties but different linear momentums, whose corresponding beam angle steers from -40\u00b0, 0\u00b0 to +40\u00b0, which verify simultaneous amplitude and momentum controls. The polar-\n\nization is changed from |) in the plots in the first row to lu\n\n) in the plots in the second row, which enable simultaneous amplitude, momentum, and polarization controls. The out- put frequency is further changed from the fundamental frequency (m=0) in the plots in the second row to m-+1 harmonic frequency in the plots in the third row (with all other wave properties remain unchanged). Thus, this example verifies simultaneous amplitude, momentum, polarization, and frequency controls by the universal meta- surface antenna 400.\n\nEM-Wave Manipulations and Information Modulations\n\n[0164] The universal metasurface antenna 400 can gener- ate relatively complicated structured lights with space- and time-varying wave properties. In some examples, the meta- surface antenna 400 can achieve arbitrary beam shaping for beam and light focusing generations (FIGS. 11 and\n\nAiry\n\n14).", "type": "Document"}}
