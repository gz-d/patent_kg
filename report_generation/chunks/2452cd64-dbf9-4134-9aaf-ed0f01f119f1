The following sections describe the pro- posed low-profile device in more detail. [0022] In order to effectively pick up the perpendicular AC magnetic flux generated by the planar inductive charging platform of Fig.2, a planar winding 1 with a cer- tain number of turns (eg 12 turns) in the secondary mod- ule is wound around a thin sheet of soft magnetic material 2 as shown in Figs.11(a) and 11(b). The height of this winding is less than the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet. This thin or low-profile structure can be placed or glued on the active side of the battery inside the battery pack. The thin soft magnetic sheet 2 serves as a magnetic core for the winding 1 and guides the perpendicular AC magnetic flux (generated by the charging platform) through the winding. It should be noted that the thickness of the soft magnetic sheet 2 can be very small (eg 0.5mm) because the cross-sectional area for the magnetic flux to flow is the large flat surface of the soft magnetic sheet (as the magnetic flux lines flow perpendicularly into and out of this flat surface). This highlights the huge advan- tage of the perpendicular flux generation of the inductive battery charging platform of WO03/105308 over the hor- izontal flux generation of GB2399225A. The \"thin\" struc- ture of the proposed device of the present invention makes it easy to modify existing battery packs without increasing substantially the thickness of the battery pack. This makes it attractive for \"low-profile\" portable electron- ic equipment such as mobile phones. [0023] It should be noted that while the present inven- tion is particularly suited for use with the battery charging platform of WO03/105308 it is not limited to use with that platform and could be used with any battery charging platform in which the lines of flux extend generally per- pendicular to the charging surface. [0024] An important alternative to the planar winding structures of Figs. 11(a) and 11(b) is shown in Figs.12 (a)", "type": "Document"}}
