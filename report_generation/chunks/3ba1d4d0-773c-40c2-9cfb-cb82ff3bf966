They are potential anti-viral agents particu- larly anti-flavivirus agents.\n\n[0065] In embodiments of the present invention, berbam- ine or its analogue as disclosed herein is administered to the subject by a route selected from a group consisting of oral delivery, intravenous delivery, intradermal delivery, intrap- eritoneal delivery and intramuscular delivery. The person skilled in the art is able to formulate berbamine or its analogue in a pharmaceutical composition according to the specific flavivirus infection and the disclosure herein.\n\n[0058] Berbamine is found to be exceptionally suitable for use in prevention and treatment of flavivirus infection. The inventors proved that berbamine has an inhibitory effect against at least JEV, ZIKV, DENV-2, EV-71 and lentivirus.\n\n[0066] In addition, berbamine or its analogue may be administered in combination with a compound selected from the group consisting of the following compounds and a derivative thereof:\n\n[0059] Berbamine and its analogues as disclosed herein may inhibit the entry of an enterovirus and/or a lentivirus into host cells of the subject, thereby boosting the immunity of the subject against various types of virus. The inventors also found that their antiviral effects are not cell-specific.\n\nO \u4eba N No O \uff0c Pe N \u5df2 Cl oe N\u2014, So\n\n[0060] It would be appreciated that salts or solvates berbamine and its analogues are also included in the scope, and may be used for preventing or treating the same virus infection.", "type": "Document"}}
