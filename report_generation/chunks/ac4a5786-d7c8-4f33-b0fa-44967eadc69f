In Dilithium, there exist large number of polyno- mial matrices and polynomial vectors that require the calculation of point-wise multiplication (PWM) and point- wise addition (PWA). Hence, an eflicient hardware design to accelerate these computations is essential to a high speed.

Set A to be a polynomial matrix and its coefficients are stored in a three-dimensional array a[k][1] nj. Assume the input polynomial coefficients are a[n] and [n], and the output polynomial coefficients are c[n]. Then, c[i]=a[i]-b[i] mod q in PWM may be obtained, while in PWA, c[i]=al[i]+b[i] mod q may be computed.", "type": "Document"}}
