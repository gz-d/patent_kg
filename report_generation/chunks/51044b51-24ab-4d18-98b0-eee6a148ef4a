Most battery chargers for mobile phones provide a DC voltage of 4-6V. The functional block diagram of a power adapter is shown in Fig.6. When the power adaptor is plugged into the electronic equipment (to be charged), the two outputs DC+ 602 and DC- 600 are connected to the mechanical contacts of the charger socket of the elec- tronic equipment. [0019] Fig.7 shows a diagram of a battery pack 700 with several external mechanical contacts that are ac- cessible. Inside the battery pack are the electric \"cells\"\u2019 704 and a \"charging protection circuit\" 706 as shown in Fig.8. Two mechanical contacts 702, 708 are connected\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55", "type": "Document"}}
