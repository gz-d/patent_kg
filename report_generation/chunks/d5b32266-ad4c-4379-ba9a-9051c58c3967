For example, conventional spinal correction systems, from the earlier Harrington, Jacobs and Luque systems to the later leveloped systems such as TSRH (SOFAMOR DANEK, US), CD Horizons (SOFAMOR DANEK, US) and ISOLA (DePuyAcroMed, Raynbam, Mass., US) and Moss Miami (DePuy AcroMed), use slightly different techniques to cor- rect scoliosis. Such correction systems can reduce spinal deformity by only 60% to 70%, but a full correction is almost impossible. The use of excessive correction forces in attempt- ing a full correction can cause bony fractures or neurological deficit due to spinal cord damage.\n\nThe present invention generally relates to a device for and method of correcting spinal deformities. In particular, the present invention relates a device for and a method of gradu- ally correcting spinal deformities.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
