The spreading\n\nGeneration\n\nand retraction dynamics of water droplets were recorded by\n\na high - speed camera ( Photron FASTCAM SA4 ) at a typical\n\n[ 0076 ] The aforementioned discussion has demonstrated\n\nrecording speed of 6000 fps . The voltage output of TIDE - G\n\nthat TIDE - G made of PTFE loaded with sufficient charges\n\nallows for the reversible and efficient electricity generation .\n\nwas measured using an oscilloscope ( Rohde & schwarzrte ,\n\nRTE1024 ) equipped with a high - impedance ( 10 MO ) probe .\n\nIt is to be noted that the sufficient charges on PTFE can be\n\nachieved by continuous droplet impinging .
