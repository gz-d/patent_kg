The Arduino-based thermal control system for the earhook was connected to a laptop through a USB cable. A processing-based graphical user interface (GUI) was devel- oped, as shown in FIG. 5, for triggering the stimuli and registering the participants\u2019 responses, The GUI ran on a Microsoft Surface Pro with touch screen.", "type": "Document"}}
