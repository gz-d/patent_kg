It can observed from FIG. 29 that the output voltage 2902 of solar energy collection antenna 500 is higher when U-shaped ground plane 504 is used, as expected.\n\nAccordingly, as can be seen from FIG. 24, the measured antenna gain 2402 with 2406 the one or more solar cell 502 panels at 2 GHz is approximately 15.2 dBi, which is slightly lower than that without 2408 the one or more solar cell panels 502 (15.5 dBi). Thus, FIG. 24 demonstrates that for a non- limiting implementation of GA 500, the loss introduced by the one or more panels 502 is relatively negligible. As a further advantage compared to exemplary non-limiting embodiment of GA 300 (gain 11.2 dBi), the gain value 15.2 dBi for non-limiting implementation of GA 500 is signifi- cantly higher due in part to a larger ground plane 504.\n\nFor instance, an output voltage 2902 of 4.27 V was obtained when the light 2710 is incident normally (00\u00b0). In addition, it is noted that the U-shaped ground plane voltage 2908 is approximately 80% higher than that for the direct- illumination case (e.g., 2.38 V with the same total path length). Moreover, the U-shaped ground plane voltage 2908 is also higher than that exemplary non-limiting GA 300 due in part a larger reflecting surface between ground plane 504 and ground plan 304. Note further that the maximum output volt- age 2902 of non-limiting implementation of GA 500 is found at 8=6\u00b0, instead of 8-0\u00b0, due in part to the net effect of diffractions, reflections, and light blockage due to the one or more solar cell panels 502.", "type": "Document"}}
