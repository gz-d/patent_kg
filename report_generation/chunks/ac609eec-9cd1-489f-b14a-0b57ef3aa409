The method too egins in step 102, in which laser pulses of different wave- lengths are transmitted to a sample. The sample may be a live object, such as a human or animal, or a dead object, such as a phantom, a device, an apparatus, etc. Then, in step 104, otoacoustic signals are received, e.g., by a probe of a otoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus, from the sample in response to the transmission. Generally, one laser ulse excites one photoacoustic signal. In step 106, the hhotoacoustic signals received are processed by a processor. The processing may be based on different models, depend- ing on the properties to be measured or calculated. After the rocessing, in step 108, one or more properties associated with the sample are determined. The determined properties may be displayed on a display, such as one operably connected with a processor, for view by the user. In one implementation, the method enables simultaneous determi- nation of multiple properties based on a limited number of laser pulses. The method too may also include acquiring an\n\nimage of the sample.\n\n[0064] In one example, the property is blood flow speed (of the sample).
