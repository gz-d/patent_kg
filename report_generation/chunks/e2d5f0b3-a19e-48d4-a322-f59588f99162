In this embodiment, the engine 204 includes a plurality of learning networks 304 (network 1, network i and network N), denot- ing the first network, the ith network and the Nth network. The number of learning networks 304 that are included within the modelling engine 204 may preferably be the number of devices that are being monitored by the system. These learning networks are arranged to model an individual device which is being monitored and thus when operation information 302 are fed into each of these learning networks 304, the learning networks 304 are arranged to identify specific patterns which have matched the combination of the operation information that has been fed into the network and in turn, provide an output that may be one or more classi- fications of condition of the device itself.\n\n[0064] With reference to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of the conditions monitoring engine 106 which is arranged to process the operation information of the devices when it is obtained by the device conditions gateway. In this example embodiment, the device modelling engine includes an optional pre-processing module 202 arranged to pre- process the conditions information before inputting the pre-processed conditions information into the device mod- elling engine 204 where the conditions information is applied to a previously generated model representative of the device so as to determine or predict the operation conditions of the device as based on the condition informa- tion obtained for the device. In turn, when this determination or prediction is made, the abnormality detection module 206 is arranged to this determination or prediction such", "type": "Document"}}
