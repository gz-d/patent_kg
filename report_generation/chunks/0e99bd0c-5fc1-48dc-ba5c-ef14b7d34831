However, the therapeutic efficiency of these drugs is limited by factors such as low platinum-DNA binding efficiency, poor selectivity between cancer and normal cells, the resistance of cancer cells towards drugs (e.g., enhanced DNA repair ability), etc.\n\n[0005] Ultraviolet (UV) and visible light photo-activated drugs (herein including pro-drugs) are known and have shown activity against, for example, cancerous tumors. However, use of current photosensitizers in such photo- activated drugs suffers from significant problems, such as side-effects, phototoxicity and cytotoxicity in non-targeted tissue, drug resistance, oxygen-dependent reactions, the requirement that the cancer/tumor/infection to be close to the skin surface and/or other internal body cavity areas accessible to UV/visible light sources, etc. which may severely limit their use and/or effectiveness.\n\n[0006] It is known that bacteria can quickly develop and transfer drug resistance to conventional antibiotics. Further- more, conventional antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) agents strongly rely on intracellular drug accumu- lation for their antibacterial effects. Therefore, the bacterial cell wall and membrane are present significant barriers to the successful application of APDT and related drugs.", "type": "Document"}}
