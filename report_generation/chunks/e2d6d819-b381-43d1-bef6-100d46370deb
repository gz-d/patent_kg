The term \u201cinducible promoter\u201d as used herein refers to a chemical or molecule that can control gene expression of a particular gene, in particular inducing a target gene to express in a system. The inducible promoter may include a tetracycline including tetracycline-type antibiotic or its derivative which is capable of inducing the expression of a\n\ntarget gene.\n\nUS 10,975,364 B2\n\n10\n\n9\n\nthe present invention may be used in the preparation of a\n\noptionally one or more of a nuclear localization sequence , a\n\nmedicament for treatment and / or in the preparation of an\n\ncell penetrating peptide sequence , an affinity tag and / or a\n\nagent for research study .\n\nfusion base editor protein .
