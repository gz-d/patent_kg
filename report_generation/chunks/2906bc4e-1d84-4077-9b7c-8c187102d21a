The momentum and the corresponding output angle of the extracted propagating wave can be tuned by changing the spatial period A through changing the applied STC matrix (FIG. 31). The space-shifting property of the Fourier Transform can be utilized to control the phase of the extracted propagating wave. In analogy with the time- shifting property but in the space domain, a shift Ax in the space domain can result in a phase shift 2tnAx/A for the n\u201c-order space harmonic. In one example, different space shifts Ax are applied to the sinusoidal amplitude envelope, resulting in different phases to the radiated n=\u20141 space harmonic (FIG. 32). In one example, the extracted power for each meta-atom from the waveguide is proportional to the modulation efficiency of the sinusoidal amplitude modula- tion\n\n=.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the extracted propagating wave of our universal metasurface antenna can be tuned by changing the modulation depth M (FIG. 33). In one example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 can gener- ate arbitrary polarization by controlling the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the extracted Iu) and IW compo- nents. To this end, equivalent sinusoidal amplitude distribu- tions with an identical spatial period A can be applied to both the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings such that the extracted lu ) and IW components share the same output angle in free space. Different space translations and modulation depths are applied to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to control the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the I) and ly ) components, respectively. As an example, the universal metasurface antenna 400 is loaded with different STC matrixes (FIG. 52) to generate six representative polariza- tions: IX), ly}. ) , I), ILCB , and IRCP (FIG. 30).\n\nAiry Beam Generation", "type": "Document"}}
