The carrier frequency modulation unit 220 may generate oscillation cycles in the time domain. It is possible to process these temporal oscillations through exist- ing demodulation algorithm while there is a spectral oscilla- tion discontinuity due to optimized SPR/LRSPR condition in the optical spectrum. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the incoming s-polarized beam 304 experiences an extra retardation against the p-polarized beam 303 as both polarized beams traverse the liquid the crystal retarder 221 electronically controlled by the electronic controller 223. As shown in FIG. 4, after pass- ing the retarder 221, an extra three-quarters of a wavelength behind is introduced between the s-polarized beam 306 and. the p-polarized beam 305. The extra retardation may be pre- cisely adjusted linearly via the application of an external\n\nThe spatial filter 102 is provided for selecting the wave- lengths of light beam emitted from the source. Optionally, the spatial filter 102 is an adjustable filter for selecting the wave- lengths. The collimator 103 transforms the input light beam into parallel beam with planar wavefront. The polarizer 104 is provided to select a content ratio between p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam components of the light source by rotat- ing a polarization angle of the polarizer 104. The polarization angle of the polarizer 104 is set at 45\u00b0 off to p-polarized beam optical axis to obtain an equal content in both p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam components. The polarization angle can be further adjusted to compensate for the SPR spectral attenuation effect in the probe beam.\n\nThe sensing unit 400 is disposed to receive the p-polarized beam 303 or 305 and the s-polarized beam 304 or 306 introducing the SPR effect associated with a target sample p-polarized probe beam.", "type": "Document"}}
