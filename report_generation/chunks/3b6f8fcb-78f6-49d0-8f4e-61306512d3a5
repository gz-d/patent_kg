It is preferred to use an integer image transform. Some integer image transforms such as an ICT, will need scaling factors in order to make it an orthogonal transform, as being orthogonal is necessary requirement for most video and image encoding standards.\n\nwhere \u540d are coefficients of the inverse quantized trans- formed block F. In the inverse transform, the core matrix matrix is not the same as those in forward transform.\n\n\u8aaa Ge ouacs\n\n(EQUATION 18)\n\nwhere C, and Q,,,.,, are defined as:\n\nFIG. 2 shows how the ICT and scaling factors are imple- mented in practice to give a transform equivalent to a DCT. It can be seen that in step 110 the residual block D is ICT transformed to give an integer image transformed residual block F*. The transformed residual block F* is then scaled in step 120 to give a scaled integer image transformed residual block F. The combination of the operations 110 and 120 is equivalent to a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the block F is equivalent to the block that would be obtained by performing a DCT on the residual block D. The block F, is then quantized in step 130 to give a quantization matrix Z, 60 65\n\n1 1 1 1 @ ab @ ab ce 1 1/2 -1/2 -1 ab \u53ca ab \u53ca 2 ee 1/2 -1 1 -1/2 ab Bab B\n\nIn the H.264/AVC, scale transform and quantization are combined together to further reduce computational complex- ity.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nzy-round(f;/A)\n\nhy\n\nand\n\nscale\n\nUS 8,019,804 B2\n\n15\n\n16\n\nrequired to perform the quantization and inverse quantization\n\nprocesses of f*.
