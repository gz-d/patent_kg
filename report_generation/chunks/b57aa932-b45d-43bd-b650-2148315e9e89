As a look up table is used it may be possible to avoid multiplication, division and/or rounding operations in the quantization and/or inverse quantization processes. For example, it may be possible to carry out the quantization and/or inverse quantization by simple comparison of f,,* val- ues with values held in the look up table. Preferably the look up table is referred to iteratively.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIt would be desirable to have a quick and efficient way of determining the distortion caused by encoding a block and a quick and efficient method of encoding blocks using an encoding scheme that is capable of utilizing a plurality of different possible encoding modes and selecting the best mode for the job.\n\nPreferably step (d) comprises the step of iteratively com- paring each coefficient f,,* of the transformed residual block to boundary points of quantization sub-zones stored in the look up table. A quantization sub-zone contains all the values of f,* between its upper and lower boundary points. The operator Q maps all the values of f,,* within the sub-zone to a particular quantization point having a quantized value zy corresponding to that sub-zone. The operator Qt maps the quantized value z,, to an inverse quantized value f,,* corre- sponding to that sub-zone.\n\nAccordingly, one aspect of the present invention proposes that the distortion is calculated in transform domain space, for example on the basis of a difference between the source and reconstructed blocks in frequency space. It is further advan- tageous if the quantization of the transformed block in fre- quency space is carried out with the aid of a look up table. In preferred embodiments of the invention it may be possible to carry out the quantization and/or inverse quantization step without multiplication or division functions, which take a lot of processing power.", "type": "Document"}}
