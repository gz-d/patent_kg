Noise generated by series parasitic inductance and/or para- sitic resistance of the components, the physical orientation of the components, and/or the layout of components, devices and/or conductive tracks (board traces) on printed circuit boards within an electronic circuit or system is reduced, sup- pressed or canceled. The reduction, suppression or cancella- tion is achieved by adding a voltage source in series with a part or component of the electronic circuit or system that exhibits capacitance, the current source being adapted to deliver a compensating voltage of roughly equal magnitude and roughly opposite phase to parasitic voltage associated with the\n\n(51) Int Cl\n\n(52) \u201cU.S. Cl 327/382\n\n(58) Field of Classification Search . 327/120 See application file for complete search history.\n\n(56) References Cited\n\nU.S. PATENT DOCUMENTS\n\n1,920,948 A 8/1933 Crouse 5,038,263 A 8/1991 Marrero et al. 6,476,689 Bl 11/2002 Uchida et al. 333/177 6,937,115 B2 8/2005 Perreault et al. 333/177 7,180,389 B2 2/2007 Wang et al. 333/181 7,242,269 B2 7/2007 Perreault et al. 333/177 2007/0188265 Al* 2008/0204126 Al 8/2007 Perreault et al. 8/2008 Wang et al. .... 333/181 327/551\n\n19 Claims, 10 Drawing Sheets\n\nHO3K 17/16 HO03K 17/30\n\n(2006.01) (2006.01)\n\nfor\n\nMay\n\n1994,\n\n(Continued)\n\n(74) &\n\npart or component.\n\nUS 8,264.270 B2\n\nPage 2\n\nSmedley, K.
