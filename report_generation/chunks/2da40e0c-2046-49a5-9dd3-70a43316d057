QDA is performed for both cyto- plasmic elasticity against cell diameter and nuclear elasticity against nuclear diameter. The classification parameters for the cytoplasmic properties are A=63.0%, S-NP=68.8% and S=S-NPC=60.0%; and the classification parameters for the nuclear properties are A=79.1%, S=S-NP=74.0% and S-NPC=86.4%. These results suggest that the classification accuracy using the elasticity values related to cell nucleus (A=79.1%) is higher than using the whole cell elasticity under both pressure levels (A<65%), implying that the nuclear elasticity values are more relevant in classifying cel. properties. To further confirm nuclear elasticity differences are distinct in these two cell lines, we counted their nuclear diameters and nuclear elasticities distributions for compari- son (see description below with respect to FIGS. 12A and 12B for further details), results of which suggest that nuclear\n\nelasticity is a significant factor in classifications.\n\n[0103] FIG. 9 depicts an exemplary computing device 900, hereinafter interchangeably referred to as a computer system 900, where one or more such computing devices 900 may be used to quantifying mechanical properties of a cell.
