For example, two common eye movement patterns for face recognition were discovered: a \u201cholistic\u201d pattern in which participants mainly looked at the center of a face, and an \u201canalytic\u201d pattern that involved more frequent eye movements between the two eyes and the face center (see, e.g., FIGURE la). Interestingly, analytic patterns were associated with better recognition performance, and this effect was consistently observed across different culture and age groups (e.g., Chuk, Chan, & Hsiao, 2017; Chuk, Crookes, Hayward, Chan, & Hsiao, 2017; Chan, Chan, Lee, & Hsiao, 2018). In addition, significantly more participants (75%) used same eye movement patterns when viewing own- and other-race faces than different patterns (Chuk, Crookes, et al., 2017). In contrast, only around 60% of participants used the same eye movement patterns between face learning and recognition, and their recognition performance did not differ significantly from those using different patterns. This is in contrast to the scan path theory, which posits that eye movements during learning have to be recapitulated during recognition\n\nfor the recognition to be successful (Chuk et al., 2017).\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288", "type": "Document"}}
