[0028] If desired, the magnitude of the correction force can be adjusted or varied in various manners. For exam- ple, the correction force can be varied by altering the size and shape of the support member. In one exemplary em- bodiment, the correction force can be adjusted by using support members of different diameters. In another ex- emplary embodiment, the correction force can be adjust- ed by using support members of different cross-sections. Additionally or alternatively, a separate device can be used to adjust the correction force. For example, a brak- ing element can be applied to the support member to dampen the correction force. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of adjusting the magnitude of the cor- rection force are also within the scope of the present in- vention. [0029] In another embodiment, the correction device can comprise one or more anchor members in various forms. The anchor member is capable of joining a portion of the support member with the spine. For example, upon the completion of spinal correction surgery, the anchor member can mount the support member onto the de- formed spine portion to lock the support member in place. Exemplary anchor members can include, but not limited", "type": "Document"}}
