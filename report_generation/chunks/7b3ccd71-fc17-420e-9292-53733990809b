During this time period, the voltage vio can be at a lower voltage than -V. The voltage vpcio can be clamped to zero voltage based at least in part on the collector-base p-n junc- tion of the transistor Qio.\n\nReferring again to FIG. 21, inaccordance with an aspect, in the system 2100, the low-side power switches, switch 2108, switch 2110, and switch 2112 can be controlled by the SDGD circuits of the low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem. The SDGD components 2120, 2122, and 2124 can respectively include current sensing resistors Rs), Rs, and Rs; and com- parators CP,, CP,, and CP, that can be used to detect the currents in the respective switches 2108, 2110, and 2112 and. drive the respective switches 2108, 2110, and 2112.", "type": "Document"}}
