In the following description like numbers denote like features.\n\n[0050] As used herein \u201c(s)\u201d following a noun means and/or singular forms of the noun.\n\n[0051] In the following description, specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the embodi- ments. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. For example, software mod- ules, functions, circuits, etc., may be shown in block dia- grams in order not to obscure the embodiments in unnec- essary detail. In other instances, well-known modules, structures and techniques may not be shown in detail in order not to obscure the embodiments.\n\n[0038] In an embodiment of the third aspect, the step c) of forming an electrolyte comprising a polymer matrix includes the steps of: forming a mixture of a first gel monomer, an initiator, a first crosslinking agent, a second crosslinking agent, and a first coupling agent; adding an alginate into the mixture to form a blend; curing the blend at room tempera- ture or a higher temperature; and soaking the cured blend in an aqueous electrolytic solution.\n\n[0039] In an embodiment of the third aspect, the first gel monomer is acrylamide, the initiator is ammonium persul- fate, the first crosslinking agent is N,N'-methylenebisacryl- amide, the second crosslinking agent is ethylene glycol, and the first coupling agent is 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl meth-\n\n[0052] Also, it is noted that at least some embodiments may be described as a method (i.e. process) that is depicted a flowchart, a flow diagram, a structure diagram, or block diagram.
