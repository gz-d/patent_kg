The scheme of the mea- surement is illustrated in FIG. 2A. Particularly, the cells are pre-treated with a calcium channel inhibitor before being subject to viral infection. After viral infection, the cells are fixed. DSRNA immunostaining is then performed on the fixed cells, followed by high-content screening and image analysis.\n\nviral infection. The inventors performed RNA in situ hybrid- ization to detect both positive (+) and negative (-) strand virus RNA in the host cells after EV-A71 infection. As shown in FIG. 1A, both EV-A71 positive and negative RNA strands were detected after 7 h virus infection of HeLa cells. EV-A71 (-)RNA strand exhibited subtle co-localization with EV-A71 (+)RNA strand. On the other hand, double- stranded RNA, as shown by double-stranded RNA (DsRNA) immunostaining, exhibited strong co-localization with virus (-)RNA strand, not LAMP1, a lysosomal marker. Besides, DsRNA and (+)RNA were accumulated in time-dependent manner after virus infection (as shown in FIG. 1B). Thus, DsRNA immunostaining and viral specific (+)RNA hybrid-", "type": "Document"}}
