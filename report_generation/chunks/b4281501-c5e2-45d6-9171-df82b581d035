The resulting dispersion was then dropped onto a 10x10 mm Cu sheet. After drying, another cleaned Cu plate was placed on top of the Cu-solder particles, forming the sandwiched structure. Pressure bond- ing experiments were conducted at room temperature by applying 20 MPa of pressure for 5 minutes.\n\n[0069] Characterization\n\n[0070] The surface morphology and distribution of samples were observed using field emission scanning elec- tron microscopy (SEM, Regulus 8230), and elemental map- ping was characterized via detector XFlash 6130. The crys- tal structures and purity of the samples were recorded using x-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Corporation, Ultima IV diffractometer). Thermal measurements of the prepared sol- der particles were performed using thermal analysis instru- ment (Q1000 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)) at a scan rate of 10 K/min to analyze and to identify changes in melting points.\n\n[0071] For cross-sectional inspection, the samples were all embedded in epoxy resin and polished with water abrasive paper (800 #, 1000 #, 2000 #), followed by diamond polishing solution (2.5 uum, 0.5 jum), and finally cleaned with deionized water for 1 min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Regulus 8230) was used to analyze the fracture surface and interfacial microstructure of solder joints. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to confirm the composition in the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In-base/Cu inter- faces. Then, the shear tester (PTR-1101, RHESCA, Japan) to\n\n\u4e00\n\nUS 2024/0009777 Al\n\nevaluate\n\nthe mechanical properties of the solder joints shear speed of 5 mm/s. To further investigate the fracture mode and to determine the phase in the solder joint, the shear samples were immediately characterized by SEM and EDS.\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
