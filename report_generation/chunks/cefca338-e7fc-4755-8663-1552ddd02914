The cold discharging process of the system 100 1s shown in FIG. 3. The concentrated solution in the solution tank 110 1s pumped into the solution channel 50 of the reactor 10 by the solution pump 112. Cooled by the cooling water produced from heat sink 160, the saturated partial vapor pressure decreases inside the solution channel 50. The liquid refrigerant in the refrigerant tank 120 is pumped into the refrigerant channel of the reactor by the refrigerant pump 122. Extracting low-grade heat from the chilled water in liquid channel 20, the liquid refrigerant evaporates and becomes vaporized refrigerant, which then passes through the membrane 45 and gets absorbed by the concentrated solution in the solution channel 50. The con- centrated solution becomes diluted after the vapor absorp- tion process and flows back to the solution tank 110. As the solution becomes increasingly diluted, the thermochemical energy is discharged for cooling via the evaporation effect in\n\nliquid channel 20.\n\n[0034] The heat discharging process of the system is shown in FIG. 4. The heat/mass transfer process is similar to that of the cold discharging process, except that the evapo- ration process extracts low-grade heat from the source liquid in liquid channel 20. The thermochemical energy is dis- charged for heating to the heat demand side 180 via the absorption effect in liquid channel 30.", "type": "Document"}}
