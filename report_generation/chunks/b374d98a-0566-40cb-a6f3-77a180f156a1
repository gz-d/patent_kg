The capacitor has a 10 uF ina typical full-wave rectifier (Inset) can be charged to 3 V, 7.5 V, 11 V, 15.4 V under continuous water droplet impinging with a frequency of 3 Hz, 8 Hz, 15 Hz, and 30 Hz, respectively. These result shows that the electricity energy generated from TIED-G can be enhanced by increasing the frequency of droplet impinging.\n\nFIG. 12 is a graph showing comparison of the maximum spreading area Ama, on the PTFE surface loaded with or without sufficient charges, respectively.\n\nFIG. 13 is a graph showing comparisons of measured charges of droplets departing from TIED-G and TENG as a function of We. It is clear that there is no notable difference in the amount of measured charges of droplets departing from TIDE-G and TENG, regardless of the We, suggesting that the enhanced electricity generation from our TIDE-G is not from the contact electrification. Error bars denote the standard error value from three measurements.\n\nFIGS. 14a to 14b are circuit diagrams showing equivalent circuits for the switching-off mode and switching-on mode, respectively; in which:\n\nFIG. 14a is the graph showing, prior to the contact of the impinging droplet with the drain electrode, there is no capacitor formed at the water/drain interface. As a result, Cp and C, stay in an open-circuit and there is no charge flow between them.\n\nFIG. 146 shows that, In contrast, with the connection of the drain electrode and PTFE rendered by the gating liquid (switching-on mode), the other capacitor Cz is established at the water/drain interface, forming a closed-circuit together with Cp and Cy.\n\nFIG. 15 is a graph showing output voltages as a function of droplet salt concentrations. The measured maximum voltage up to ~170 V appears when the ion concentration is increased to 10\u00b0\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\n8\n\nat", "type": "Document"}}
