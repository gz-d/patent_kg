Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which has been identified to use as an electret material with high negative charge storage capability and robust stability that can be preserved through continuous droplet impinging, is designed on the top of ITO source to function as a virtual source. The PTFE enables the electrostatic induction of positive charges on ITO. Experiment leading to the present invention have demonstrated that the spreading of the soft, configurable droplet bridges the originally disconnected components in the device into a closed, electrical system, transforming the conventional solid/liquid interfacial effect into a desirable bulk effect. Such a unique design allows for the reversible and eflicient transfer of charges between the source/virtual source and drain, resulting in the enhance- ment of power density by several orders of magnitude as opposed to its counterparts imposed by the interfacial effect. The present invention is applicable in a variety of systems or applications, and can represent a paradigm-shift in the\n\n[0053] FIG. 13 is a graph showing comparisons of mea- sured charges of droplets departing from TIED-G and TENG as a function of We. It is clear that there is no notable difference in the amount of measured charges of droplets departing from TIDE-G and TENG, regardless of the We, suggesting that the enhanced electricity generation from our TIDE-G is not from the contact electrification.
