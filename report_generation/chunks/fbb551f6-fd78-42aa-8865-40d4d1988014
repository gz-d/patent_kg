The memory device of the present inven- tion shows improvement in speed of TCAM without using additional hardware resources on FPGAs.\n\n[0083] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.\n\n[0075] In this operation, the update latency of RAM-based TCAMs may be proportional to the depth of the utilized RAM blocks. Comparing BRAM-based TCAMs have a 513-clock cycle update latency, distributed-RAM based TCAMs in accordance with embodiments of the present invention have an update latency of only 65 clock cycles.\n\n[0076] Yet in other example embodiment, there is pro- vided a method of manipulating an electronic memory device, in particular a searching operation performed by the memory device. The method comprises the step of: provid- ing an input search key to an input of the electronic memory device; dividing the input search key into a plurality of sub-words, wherein each of the sub-words are provided as address input of each of the plurality of basic memory blocks; generating a plurality of matchline vectors; convert- ing the matchlines associated with the plurality of matchline vectors to a potential match address representing location of data stored in the electronic memory device matching with the input search key; and outputting the potential match address.\n\n[0084] Any reference to prior art contained herein is not taken as an admission that the information is common general knowledge, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n1.
