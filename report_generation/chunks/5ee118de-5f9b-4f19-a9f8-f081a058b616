As an example, further implementations can employ six antenna element(s) (e.g., reflective SPA 102 elements) in a three by two array arranged on V-shaped reflective ground plane 304 as further described above regarding FIGS. 3-4. In yet another non-limiting example, implementations can employ nine antenna element(s) (e.g., reflective suspended plate antenna (SPA) 102 elements) in a three by three array arranged on U-shaped reflective ground plane 504 as further described above regard- ing FIGS. 5-6.", "type": "Document"}}
