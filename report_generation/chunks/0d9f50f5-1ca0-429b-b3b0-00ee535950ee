In some examples, the first slot portion of the second slot and the second slot portion of the second slot are at opposite sides (e.g., opposite long sides) of the second slot.\n\nthe first semiconductor ele-\n\nIn\n\n[0025] some embodiments, ment of the first control arrangement and the second semi- conductor element of the first control arrangement are disposed generally along a first control arrangement axis; and the first semiconductor element of the second control arrangement and the second semiconductor element of the second control arrangement are disposed generally along a second control arrangement axis. The first control arrange- ment axis and the second control arrangement axis may be arranged at a non-zero angle (i.e., not parallel). In some examples, the first control arrangement axis and the second control arrangement axis may be arranged at about 90 degrees. Optionally, the first control element arrangement axis is generally perpendicular to the first axis. Optionally, the second control element arrangement axis is generally\n\nperpendicular to the second axis.\n\n[0026] In some embodiments, the first and second semi- conductor elements of the first control arrangement are biased in the same bias state. The bias state may be forward-biased state or a non-biased state.\n\na\n\n[0027] In some embodiments, the first and second semi- conductor elements of the second control arrangement biased in the same bias state.
