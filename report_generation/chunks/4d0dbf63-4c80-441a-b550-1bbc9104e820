Each of the below listed applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety:\n\na voltage level within a specified tolerance range, even when the load current varies. FIG. 1 shows a structure of a typical switching voltage regulator 10. It comprises a power supply 12, a power conversion stage (PCS) 14 and a controller stage 16. The controller stage 16 senses the output voltage v, of the voltage regulator 10, compares it with a reference verof the voltage regulator, receives some system variables such as inductor current, switch voltage, switch current, etc, and uses these to derive a control signal to command a control variable, typically duty cycle, to the PCS 14, so as to regulate v, to converge it to ve In this example of a typical voltage regu- lator, there is provided an output passive component compris- ing a capacitor \u2018C\u2019 18 connected in parallel with a load imped- ance \u2018Z,\u2019 20 of the voltage regulator 10. A linear regulator has a similar construction and mode of operation although it will be understood that the PCS ofa linear regulator does not have an inductor, a switch voltage and a switch current, but instead\n\nPatent application Ser.
