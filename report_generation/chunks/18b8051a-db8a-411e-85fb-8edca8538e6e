The determined oxygen saturation can be uncom- pensated oxygen saturation in the blood or compensated oxygen saturation in the blood.\n\n[0015] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the first, second, and third laser pulses are transmitted sequentially, e.g., from the same laser source, and in such a way that a time difference between transmission of the first and second laser pulses is in the order of micro-seconds or sub-micro- seconds, and a time difference between transmission of the second and third laser pulses is in the order of micro-seconds\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nor\n\nsub-microseconds. The two time differences (between adjacent laser pulses) may be different or the same.\n\n[0016] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the process- ing includes determining a first amplitude of the first pho- toacoustic signal and a third amplitude of the third photoa- coustic signal; and applying the first and third amplitudes to the linear spectral unmixing model.
