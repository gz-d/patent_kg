In such an embodiment the AC capacitor may be connected in series with the first coil form- ing a resonant tank with the first coil and the magnetic sheet. The diode rectifier may be either a standard diode rectifier or a voltage doubler. The output of the rectifier can preferably be fed to a de-DC voltage regulator which provides a stable voltage for charging the battery.\n\nPreferably the energy receiving element further comprises AC capacitor connected in series with the first coil and forming a resonant tank with the first coil and the magnetic sheet.", "type": "Document"}}
