As a result, corre- sponding components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, transistors, diodes, zener diodes, switches, etc.) of SDGD component 2118 can operate in a same or similar manner as the SDGD components 2114 and 2116 (e.g., in the high-side portion of the SDGD subsystem), and the SDGD components 2120 and 2124 can operate in a same or similar manner as the SDGD component 2122 (e.g., in the low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem). Thus, components of SDGD component 2116, including, for example, resistors (Re through R, ;, inclusive), capacitors (C, through C,, inclusive), switches (Mo and M,,), transistors (Q, through Q,,4, inclusive), diode D,, and zener diode D_,, and components of SDGD component 2118, including, for example, resistors (R,, through R,;, inclusive), capacitors (C, through Cg, inclusive), switches (M,, and M,,), transistors (Qis through Q,,, inclusive), diode D,, and zener diode D,,, can function in a same or similar manner as corresponding components in SDGD component 2112. Fur- ther, components of SDGD component 2120, including, for example, resistors (R2> through Ras, inclusive), capacitors (C,, through C,,, inclusive), transistors (Q,. and Q,;), diode", "type": "Document"}}
