In the past such devices have been provided with a charging socket and a charging adaptor. The charging adaptor is usu- ally an AC/DC adaptor that is connected to the electrical mains supply and normally outputs to the charging socket a controlled DC supply voltage suitable for charging a particu- lar battery.\n\nAn object of the present invention therefore is to provide methods of integrating a secondary coil into a range of elec- trical devices so that they may be used with a planar battery charging platform of the type described in WO03/105308.", "type": "Document"}}
