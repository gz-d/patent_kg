The metasurface antenna 200 includes a metasurface structure 202 and a waveguide 204 operably coupled with the metasurface structure. In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 202 is the metasur- face structure 102 of FIG. 1 (and the controller 20 may correspond to the controller 10 in FIG. 1). The waveguide 204 is operable to guide an electromagnetic wave and the metasurface structure 202 is operable to modulate the elec- tromagnetic wave and to radiate a modulated electromag- netic wave.\n\n[0119] In some embodiments, the waveguide 204 is oper- able to guide the electromagnetic wave, and the metasurface structure 202 is operable to radiate the modulated electro- magnetic wave away from the waveguide into free space. For example, the electromagnetic wave may be an in-plane wave (e.g., in-plane guided wave), and the modulated elec- tromagnetic wave may be an out-of-plane wave (e.g., out- of-plane propagating wave).\n\nembodiments, the metasurface structure\n\n[0120]\n\nIn\n\nsome 202 may be at least partly integrated with the waveguide 204.", "type": "Document"}}
