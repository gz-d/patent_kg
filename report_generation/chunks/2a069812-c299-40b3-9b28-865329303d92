Different from the liquid iode fabricated on rigid silicon, the use of PE substrate not nly endows a high degree of flexibility, but also imparts enhanced chemical stability against corrosives. FIG. 4 shows the morphology of the PE rectifier, which is orderly decorated with capillary channels and reentrant structures (highlighted by the inset of FIG. 41). The liquid diode displays very stable liquid rectification performance even a re \u00b0 fier 6,000 buckling cycles, suggesting its unprecedented \u2018obustness (FIG. 4J). Such a flexible and mechanochemi- ally robust rectifier is potentially suitable for adhering onto complex surfaces\u2014in the form of adhesive tape\u2014for the directional of diverse fluids. CC: c\n\n[0092] Biomimetic materials construction. The doubly reentrant structure was fabricated by TPA and then transfer- printed to PP material (FIG. 12). The liquid repellency was evaluated by testing the rebound of water, ethanol, and hexane droplets under Weber number ~0.5. The contact angles of the droplets were measured when the liquids reach static. The silicon liquid rectifier was fabricated using stan- dard MEMS process, as described elsewhere (3) and then transfer-printed to PE material. The P E liquid rectifier was then treated with air plasma to decrease the apparent contact angles of water to ~15\u00b0. 1-M NaOH aqueous solution was fed onto the surface of the rectifier at a velocity of 20 L/min, and the spreading behavior was recorded with a camera.", "type": "Document"}}
