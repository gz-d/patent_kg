However, these materials lack selectivity and can inhibit and kill pathogenic microbes as well as normal cells in the human body, qualities which are detrimental to, and limit, wide practical application. These materials also tend to inevitably suffer from damage during use, which reduces service life and increases costs remarkably.\n\n[0013] R,, Ry, Rs and R, are independently selected from the group consisting of (i) a linear or branched alkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkenyl group, optionally com- prising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkyny. group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (ii) a cycloalkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroa- tom; (iii) an aryl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (iv) a heteroatom; and (v) a hydrogen atom; and\n\nqualities such as strong mechanical, antimicrobial and pro- longed release properties are desired.\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n[0005] A first aspect of the present invention relates to a composition comprising one or more monomeric units hav- ing a structure of Formula (1), and wherein the one or more monomeric units encapsulate a hydrophobic material.\n\n[0014] the dotted line denotes no double bonds, one double bond, two double bonds, or three double bonds in the cyclic group.\n\nSNH oO 0 \u548c \u592a \u548c \u548c \u548c \u548c \u87ec \u7ad9 TY Ne.
