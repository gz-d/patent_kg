Read counts listed on the right represent the number of GUIDE-Seq reads; on-target site indicated by \u201c*\u201d and mismatched bases in off-target sites with the on-target site are highlighted.\n\nFIG. 3C shows on-target and off-target cleavages detected GUIDE-Seq of wild-type SaCas9 (WT).\n\nFIG. 1B is a diagram showing SaCas9 amino acid resi- dues in contact with the gRNA-target DNA heteroduplex labeled with protospacer positions, with 21 being most proximal to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) on the target DNA.\n\nFIG. 3D shows on-target and off-target cleavages detected GUIDE-Seq of SaCas9 modified protein R245A.\n\nFIG. 3E shows on-target and off-target cleavages detected by GUIDE-Seq of SaCas9 modified protein SaCas9-HF with mutations at positions R245, N413, N419 and R654, i.e. modified Cas9 protein comprising an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 3.\n\nFIG. 1C is a diagram showing the structural domains of SaCas9 and the positions of four amino acid residues, R245, N413, N419 and R654.\n\nFIG. 1D is a bar graph showing the percentage of inser- tions or deletions of bases (indels) on human endogenous site EMX1_6 in HEK293T cells using wild-type SaCas9 (WT), single amino acid substitution SaCas9 modified pro- teins R245A, N413A, N419A and R654A, and a no-Cas9 negative control (NC).\n\nFIG. 3F shows genome-wide cleavage sites detected DE-Sed at canonical NNGRRT PAM sites.\n\nG. 3G shows genome-wide cleavage sites detected DE-Seq at non-canonical NNNRRT PAM sites.\n\nG. 4A is a bar graph showing the number of off-target sites identified at EMX1_6, FANCF_13 and VEGFA using GUIDE-Seq by different SaCas9 residue mutation combinations.\n\nFIG. 1E is a bar graph showing the percentage of human endogenous site VEGFA_8 in HEK293T cells using wild-type SaCas9 (WT), single amino acid substitu- SaCas9 modified proteins R245A, N413A, N419A and R654A, and a no-Cas9 negative control (NC).", "type": "Document"}}
