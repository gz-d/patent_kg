The substrate of the antenna can be formed by one or more substrate layers, of the same or different dielectric constants (er). The dielectric constant of the substrate layer can vary. The shape, form, and size of the substrate; the shape, form, and size of the ground plane; and the shape, form, and size of the microstrip network or patch network can be different. The patch network can have any number of (at least one) patches with any of shape and form. The patch(es) need not necessarily be arranged symmetrically. The patches could form an array to give an array antenna (integrated with filter). The feed of the antenna can be non-coaxial feed, such as microstrip feed. The feed need not be perpendicular to the face of the substrate, but can be parallel or at any other angles to the face of the substrate. The filter-antenna can be made with different form factors. The filter-antenna can be used for other radio frequencies (e.g., microwave) not spe-\n\n[0057] FIG. 8 shows the measured and simulated total antenna efficiency (mismatch included) of the filter-antenna 400. With reference to FIG. 8, the measured efficiency is higher than 72.5% from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a maxi- mum of 78.5% at 5.74 GHz. The simulated peak efliciency is 89.7% at 5.98 GHz. The efficiency decreases rapidly on the band-edge and then becomes small in the stopbands, giving a sharp selectivity. Since the antenna 200, 400 is matched across the entire band (5-6.5 GHz), it can be inferred that the energy is mostly dissipated in the chip resistor in the antenna stopbands. This illustrates that a well-matched antenna does not necessarily radiate effec- tively. Again, the simulated result of the reference patch antenna is included in FIG. 8. As expected, the reference does have\n\n[0058] The simulated power loss in the chip resistor is shown in FIG. 9.
