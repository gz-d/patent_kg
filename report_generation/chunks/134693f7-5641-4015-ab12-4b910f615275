Before the impinging water droplet engages the TIDE-G, the gate channel between the source and drain is absent. In this switching-off state/mode, there is no current output (please see top portion of figure). By comparison, in the switching-on state, the source and drain are connected by the spreading droplet, yielding a significant electricity generation (please see bottom portion of figure).\n\nFIG. 1\u00a2 is a graph showing that, with the progression of continuous impinging of individual droplets, there is a gradual increase In the charges on the PTFE surface of as-fabricated TIDE-G device.\n\nFIGS. 2a to 2c provides an electricity generation characterization of the present invention, in which:\n\nFIG. 2a is an optical image showing four parallel TIDE-G devices fabricated on a glass substrate (please see left portion of figure). Each droplet impinging on an individual TIDE-G device lights up 100 commercial LEDs (please see right portion of figure).\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\n4", "type": "Document"}}
