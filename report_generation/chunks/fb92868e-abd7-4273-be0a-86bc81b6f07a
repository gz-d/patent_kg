The two portions may be screwed to form an enclosed chamber by four screws arranged circumferentially on the chamber. Such configu- ration may be advantageous as the user may easily replace the PC membrane with membranes modified with other receptors for detecting other target substances. It may also be advantageous for cleaning the compartments after each measurement.", "type": "Document"}}
