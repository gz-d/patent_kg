[0009] Based on two planar windings on two parallel planes as shown in Fig.3, it has been shown that both energy and signal can be transferred from one planar winding to another. This planar PCB transformer tech- nology has been applied in a range of applications. In 2004, it was used by for a contactless battery charger for mobile phone in Choi B., Nho J., Cha H. and Choi S.:, \u2019Design and implementation of low-profile contactless battery charger using planar printed circuit board wind- ings as energy transfer device\u2019, IEEE Transactions on", "type": "Document"}}
