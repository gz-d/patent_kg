Regarding the parameters listed in the table, Qstep is the quantization step, the \u201cposition regions\u201d refer to the position of the coefficient f,,* in terms of i and j and are given in FIG. 3, q,, is the scaling factor and A,, is the quanti- zation parameter which has been defined above.

Besides, we can also get f,,* by multiplying zy by a quantization parameter stored in the look up table or by referring directly to the look up table if the inverse quantized values are stored in the look table.\n\nThis equation indicates that SSD(F, F) can be directly related to the quantization error of f,,*. Therefore, we can calculate SSD(F, F) more easily as we do not need to obtain fy and fy.
