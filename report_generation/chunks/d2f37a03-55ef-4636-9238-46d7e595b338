Using GUIDE-Seq (ge- nome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing), it was found that one engi- neered modified SaCas9 protein, SaCas9-HF (with muta- tions of N413A,R245A,N419A and R654A) advantageously and significantly reduced off-target cleavages without com- promising on-target activity. Of five endogenous target sites in human cells tested using SaCas9-HF, significantly less or no off-target activity was detected at the target sites. Further, adding these residue modifications onto the KKH-SaCas9 variant previously described (i.e. with mutations of E782K, N968K and R1015H) to target a broader PAM range (NNNRRT) also resulted in significantly reduced off-target activity of KKH-SaCas9-HF when compared with KKH- SaCas9 across endogenous target sites in human cells tested. Thus, the present invention provides an improved modified SaCas9 protein for use in altering the genome of a cell with increased specificity enabling genome-editing applications with high genome-wide precision.\n\nExample 5\n\nImproved Specificity on KKH-SaCas9", "type": "Document"}}
