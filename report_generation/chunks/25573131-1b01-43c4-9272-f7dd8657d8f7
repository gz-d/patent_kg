According to the AFM height image, the collected organic-gold nanosheets transferred onto a silicon substrate has a uniform thickness of approxi- mately 20 nm (FIG. 2C). Subsequently, corresponding selected-area electron diffraction of the 20 nm-thick organic- gold nanosheets was also conducted by TEM, as shown in FIG. 2D. FIG. 2E is the FTIR pattern, showing the presence of broken PVA molecular structures.\n\n[0070] In one embodiment, FIGS. 3A and 3B show a 20 nm-thick organic-gold nanosheet on the 1 cmxl cm silicon substrate before and after annealing, respectively. The annealing conditions are at 350\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. After annealing, the as-fabricated FCC gold-amorphous carbon core-shell nanoparticles were observed by using a transmis- sion electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in FIGS. 3C to 3E. In the TEM images, it clearly reveals that the amorphous surface layer has a lattice spacing value of approximately 2 nm, and the FCC gold core has a lattice spacing value of 0.227 nm.\n\n[0071] Compared to the traditional methods for the syn- thesis and deployment of nanoparticles, the present nanosheet-based fabrication method is flexible and highly efficient. The freestanding nanosheets can be easily trans- ferred onto various substrates regardless of their morphol- ogy and roughness. The thickness of the metal film can be adjusted in accordance with the deposition time.
