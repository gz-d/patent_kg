FIG. 10 con- tains 9 plots arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. Specifically, FIG. 10, in the first row plots a to c, shows the measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface antenna at the fundamental frequency with the Ix) polariza- tion, whose main beam scans to -40\u00b0, 0\u00b0, and 40\u00b0, respec- tively. FIG. 10, in the second row plots d to f, shows the measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal meta- surface antenna at the fundamental frequency with the lu ) polarization, whose main beam scans to -40?, 0\u00b0, and 40\u00b0. FIG. 10, in the second row plots g to i, shows the measured far-field radiation patterns of the universal metasurface\n\nantenna when the frequency of the extracted propagating\n\nwave is changed to the m=+1 harmonic, with the I) polar- ization, whose main beam scans to -40\u00b0, 0\u00b0, and 40\u00b0. The three lines in each plots demonstrate the amplitude controls of the radiated propagating waves. In this example, the input frequency and modulation frequency are fy=23.5 GHz and fy=1.2 MHz, respectively.\n\nFIGS. 11 to 17 relate to the universal metasurface\n\n[0142]", "type": "Document"}}
