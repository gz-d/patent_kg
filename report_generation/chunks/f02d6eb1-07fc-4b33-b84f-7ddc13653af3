More specifically, the COF may be used as an electrode (e.g., a cathode) in an energy storage device, e.g., a sodium-ion battery or a lithium-ion battery that may be rechargeable. The redox active sites provided by\n\nMar. 7, 2024\n\nthe sulfur atoms of the thioether linkages and the carbonyl groups of the quinone moieties, as well as the porous and rigid structure, facilitate diffusion of ions (e.g., ion insertion and extraction) of the device and provide excellent stability of the electrode in the electrolyte, thus maximizing the capacity and providing excellent reversibility for the device. [0057] FIG. 2 shows an example energy storage device 20 that utilizes a COF as a cathode. The illustrated energy storage device 20 takes the form of a coin cell. The coin cell 20 includes a casing with a larger case 22 (e.g., the positive side) and a smaller case 24 (e.g., the negative case). The components within the casing include, assembled in the following order: an o-ring 26 adjacent the smaller case 24, a spring 28, a spacer 30, an anode 32, a separator 34 and an electrolyte, and a cathode 36 adjacent the larger case 22 having a cast film closer to the anode 32. The spacer 30 may be a stainless steel spacer. The anode 32 may be a metal piece, such as a metal foil, a metal disc, etc. The spacer 30 and the anode 32 be first coupled together before the\n\nmay\n\nFormula (I)", "type": "Document"}}
