The HP port is a high-performance interface that connect to the DDR controller. It could read and write a large amount of data in memory through AXI protocol. The GP port is a general-purpose low-performance interface that could read and write registers on the PL through AXI-Lite protocol.\n\n[0061] Preferably, the hardware processor 102 further comprises a DMA intermedium 106C arranged to facilitate exchanging the computation data between the AXI memory interconnect and the plurality of hardware accelerator mod- ules through the AXI protocol.\n\nOn the PL\n\nDMA is the intermedium for data", "type": "Document"}}
