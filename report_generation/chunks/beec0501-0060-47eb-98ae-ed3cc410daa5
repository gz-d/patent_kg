The magnetic elements MM1 may be disposed on a bottom surface of the top insulating layer 112a. The magnetic elements MM1 may be disposed on the receiving electrode portions RP, respectively. The magnetic elements MM1 may be disposed on ends of the enameled wires EW, respectively. Each of the magnetic elements MM1 may be disposed on an overlap area between the corresponding receiving electrode portion RP and the corresponding enameled wire EW. On the other hand, the magnetic elements MM2 may be dis- posed on the top surface of the intermediate insulating layer 1124. The magnetic elements MM2 may be disposed under the receiving electrode portions, respectively. The magnetic elements MM2 may be disposed under the ends of the enameled wires EW. By such a configuration, the relative position between the receiving electrode portion RP and the enameled wire EW is more stable, thereby achieving a better connection through the magnetic force generated by the magnetic elements MM1, MM2. In some embodiments, the magnetic elements MM1, MM2 are, for example without\n\nThe circuit board CB may be a print circuit board (PCB), a flexible circuit board, or a rigid circuit board. In some embodiments, the circuit board CB is a PCB board based on Microchip MGC3130, for example, and the present inven- tion is not limited thereto. The circuit board CB includes a processor P, a memory M coupled to the processor P, and a signal generator SG.\n\nIn some embodiments, the processor P is a hardware with computing capability, and is used to manage the overall operation of the device. In the embodiment, the processor\n\nis,\n\n60\n\n65\n\nlimitation, magnets.\n\n100\n\nBrief Sensing Principle of the interactive wearable device\n\nas", "type": "Document"}}
