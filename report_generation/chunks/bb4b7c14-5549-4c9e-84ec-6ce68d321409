Introduction\n\nFIG. 3 is a table showing the values of the quantization parameter A,, for different position regions:\n\nThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the distortion caused by encoding a block of video or image data. This may be conveniently calculated based on the squared sum or differences between a source block and a reconstructed block of image or video data. The rate-distortion of a particular inter or intra encoding mode may also be calculated on the basis of the distortion and the number of bits required to entropy encode a block which has been encoding according to the particular inter or intra encod- ing mode. Preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of encoding image or video data, including selecting an encoding mode based on the rate-distortion of said mode.\n\nFIG. 4 is a quantization diagram;\n\nFIG. 5 is a table showing some inverse quantized values and corresponding sub-zone boundaries for some quanitiza- tion points;\n\na showing quantized quantization sub-zone boundaries for different positions regions;\n\nFIG. 7 is a schematic diagram showing a method of calcu- lating the SSD between source and reconstructed blocks\n\nFIG. 8 is a schematic diagram showing a method of calcu- lating an SSD according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention;\n\nThe present invention may be utilized with any image video encoding standard which uses inter or intra prediction.
