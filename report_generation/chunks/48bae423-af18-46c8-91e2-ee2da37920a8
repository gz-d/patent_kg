The composition has been shown to display mechanical robustness, fast healing, strong adhesiveness and sustained release antibiotic properties. Based on the supramolecular polymerization and polymer chains cross- linked networks, hierarchical hydrogen-bond interactions enable high mechanical strength and fast healing at elevated temperatures. Specifically, strong quadruple hydrogen bonds enable the polymerization of monomeric units, and weak intermolecular hydrogen bond contribute to the crosslinks and aggregations of the monomeric units. Carvacrol oil has been shown to readily affect the mechanical strength of the composition through damage to the intermolecular weak hydrogen bonding. Consequently, mechanical and healable properties of the composition can be controlled, thereby beneficially providing a high strength, self-healing, pro-\n\nR;, Ry, Rs and Re are independently selected from the group consisting of (i) a linear or branched alkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkenyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkynyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (ii) a cycloalkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (iii) an aryl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (iv) a heteroatom; and (v) a hydrogen atom; and.\n\nthe dotted line denotes no double bonds, one double bond, two double bonds, or three double bonds in the cyclic group.\n\n1.
