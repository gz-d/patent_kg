The regulator comprises a power conversion stage, and a controller circuit having means for sensing an output signal of the regulator and comparing it to a reference signal of the regulator to generate a control signal for con- trolling the power conversion stage so as to regulate the out- put signal of the regulator to converge to a level of the refer- ence signal. The regulator also comprises a compensator circuit having means for sensing an output signal at a passive component at the output of the regulator, means for generat- ing a ripple compensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference signal comprising a difference between a level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal, and means for applying the ripple compensating signal to the passive component to thereby reduce a ripple signal compris- ing the difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal to provide a compensated output signal for the regulator, the compensator circuit being con- figured such that the compensator circuit does not have to a whole of an load of the regulator.\n\nOne advantage of this arrangement is that a compensator circuit for generating the compensating signal does not have process the whole of the output load power of the regulator.\n\nPreferably, the step of generating the compensating signal includes amplifying the difference signal. This improves the efficiency of the compensator circuit and further reduces power rating.\n\nThe sensed output signal may comprise a voltage signal sensed across an output capacitor component of said regula- said output capacitor component being arranged in par- allel with an output load impedance of said regulator.\n\nThe compensating signal may comprise a voltage compen- sation signal applied in series to said output capacitor com- ponent. In some examples, a current source may be used.", "type": "Document"}}
