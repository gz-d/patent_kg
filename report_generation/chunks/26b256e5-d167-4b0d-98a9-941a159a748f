Secondary particles are agglomerated with primary grains formed by a calcining process. The size of the primary grains is around 5-20 nm. The boundary of the primary grains is monoclinic phase, so each of the secondary particles includes a three-dimensional monoclinic grain boundary network that spreads over the secondary particles. In gen- eral, a mixing ratio range is 1.03 to 1.06:1 for the lithium precursor to the transition metal precursor. In one embodi-\n\nApr. 14, 2022\n\nment, the mixing ratio of the lithium precursor and the transition metal precursor is 1.06:1. Optionally, the calcining process includes a two-step calcining process, and includes (a) annealing the transition metal precursor and lithium precursor to form an intermediate product; and (b) further annealing the intermediate product to form the final product of the cathode material. The first anneal may be a lower- temperature anneal in the range of 400-600\u00b0 C. for a period of 4-6 hours; the second anneal may be higher-temperature anneal in the range of approximately 600-1000\u00b0 C. for a period of 10-20 hours in an oxygen-containing environment.\n\nExamples\n\nSynthesis of Pristine NCM811 and PGE-NCM811 Materials", "type": "Document"}}
