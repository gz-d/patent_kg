As shown in FIG. 11A, when the switch of the apparatus is conducting, the electrical current passes through the PV module, therefore NIR light is emitted by the PV module. As shown in FIG. 11B, when the switch of the apparatus is not conducting, no/less current passes through the PV module, therefore no/minimum NIR light is emitted by the PV module. 60\n\nFIG. 12 shows how a plurality of PV devices is configured to communicate with a UAV according to the present invention.
