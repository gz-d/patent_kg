According to an aspect, GA 300 can comprise a 3x2 array consisting of 6 SPA 102 radiating elements placed on a V-shaped concave ground plane 304. According to various embodiments, GA 300 can be fabricated with approximate arameters of d (306)=70 mm, W, (308)=180 mm, Le (310)= 458 mm, and 6, (312)=S degrees (\u00b0) as depicted. According to further embodiments, one or more solar cell panel(s) 302 (e.g., one-sided amorphous solar cell panel(s)) of W (314)=60 mm, L, (316)=150 mm can be electrically connected (e.g., electrically connected in parallel) and can be suspended above the V-shaped concave ground 304 at a distance of H\n\nciated ground plane can act as a light-reflecting surface for one or more solar cell(s). For example, in various embodi- ments one or more SPA arrays can be built on ground planes (e.g., non-planar ground planes) that facilitate focusing light for use by one or more solar cell(s). Thus, the ground planes (e.g., non-planar ground planes) light-focusing effects can result in relatively larger output voltages can be obtained from the solar cell systems. The increased voltage can be as much as approximately 80% higher than that without the green antennas. In a further aspect, an SPA element can be excited by an L-probe that can facilitate wideband microwave opera- tion of antenna structures, for which, simulated and measured reflection coefficients, input impedance, antenna gains, and radiation patterns of disclosed embodiments indicate benefi- cial use in systems that require self-sustained power (e.g.,\n\n318.", "type": "Document"}}
