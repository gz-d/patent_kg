To this purpose, the mica substrate of Example 1.1 was irradiated with ultraviolet lights emitted from two light sources of 254 nm and 185 nm, in which the energy of 185 nm ultraviolet light accounted for 10%, and the ReS, flake was irradiated for 180 seconds at the humidity level of 30% or 80%, and the atomic force microscopy images were respectively taken. Results are provided in FIG. 11.\n\n[0056] According to the photos provided in FIG. 11, when irradiation was performed at higher humidity level (Le 80%), it gave a much wrinkle pattern structure as compared that at lower humidity level (i.e., 30%).\n\nto\n\n[0057] It will be understood that the above description embodiments is given by way of example only and\n\nof that\n\nDec. 29, 2022\n\nvarious modifications may be made by those with ordinary skill in the art. The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the structure and use of exemplary embodiments of the invention. Although various embodiments of the invention have been described above with a certain degree of particularity, or with reference to one or more individual embodiments, those with ordinary skill in the art could make numerous alterations to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.\n\n[0058] For example, in a variation of the embodiments, ReS, flakes may be supplied by a preceding process, and irradiated in UV to produce the wrinkles in a current process. What is claimed is:\n\n1. A method of producing a substrate having a wrinkle pattern of a single-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS,) nanoflakes deposited thereon in a reaction chamber, in which the reaction chamber has a tubular body having first and second temperature zones, and first and second containers, the method comprises,", "type": "Document"}}
