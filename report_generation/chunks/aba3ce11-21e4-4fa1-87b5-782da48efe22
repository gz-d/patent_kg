In this process, the source domain set trained learning network is then \u201cfine tuned\u201d individually to each wind turbine as the target domain data is obtained from each individual wind turbine. in this way, the source domain set trained learning network is then adapted or transferred into an individual learning network for each individual wind turbine. This is advanta- geous as the domain adaptation or transferred learning process allows a trained learning network with knowledge developed by training with a larger set of data (many wind turbines) to be specifically adapted or transferred to work with an individual wind turbine that would on its own have much small set of training data. These processes, including the grouping of operation information 406 into source domain data set and target data set as well as the training process 408 is further described below with reference to FIGS. 5 to 9.\n\n[0073] In this example embodiment, the method includes five steps 402, 404, 406, 408, 410. These are operation information collection (data collection) 402, operation infor- mation pre-processing (data pre-processing) 404, operation information grouping (data grouping) 406, device model training 408 and condition monitoring 410.\n\n[0074] Initially, when the method is started for the moni- toring of devices, operation information or operation data for each of the devices are first collected. This information may then be processed by the device modelling engine mentioned earlier with reference to FIGS. 1 to 3 should the models have already been generated. However, in the first instance when these models have not yet been generated, steps 402, 404, 406 and 408 are therefore undertaken so as to generate the models of the devices which will be used to perform the processing of the operation information.", "type": "Document"}}
