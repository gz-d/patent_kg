The method includes receiving multiple photoacoustic signals (e.g., a first pho- toacoustic signal and a second photoacoustic signal) from a sample in response to transmission of multiple laser pulses (e.g., a first laser pulse and a second laser pulse) to the sample; and processing the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a flow model that relates photoacoustic signals with flow speed to determine a flow speed of a liquid flow in the sample. The first pulse laser has a first wavelength and the second laser pulse has a second wavelength different from the first wavelength. Pref- erably, the method is performed using one or more proces- sors, optionally at least partly incorporated in a photoacous- tic imaging or sensing apparatus. The one or more processors may be arranged on the same apparatus, or arranged distributively on a computing network. The sample may be placed in or on a holder or support of the photoa-\n\ncoustic imaging or sensing apparatus.\n\n[0005] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the process- ing includes determining the amplitudes of multiple photoa- coustic signals; and applying the determined amplitudes to the flow model. For example, the processing includes deter- mining a first amplitude of the first photoacoustic signal and a second amplitude of the second photoacoustic signal; and. applying the first and second amplitudes to the flow model.\n\n[0006] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the flow model is an exponential decay model.\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\n[0007] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the flow model relates the first and second amplitude with flow speed\n\nby:\n\n~ Fela P+ pe PB Ag Cather = Fina\u2019 Fiflat\n\n\u5fc6", "type": "Document"}}
