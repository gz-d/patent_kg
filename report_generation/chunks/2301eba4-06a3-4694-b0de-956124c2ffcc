The integration of a microstrip antenna and a solar cell panel usually causes the antenna gain to degrade significantly, although recent efforts have advanced the technology to increase the antenna gain of the solar-cell-integrated (metal- lic) microstrip antenna to ~1.05 dBi. However, this is still ~6 dB lower than that of metallic microstrip antennas. Moreover, the effective illumination area of the solar cell panel is some- what reduced because of introducing the non-transparent microstrip antenna. In order to solve this problem, it has been proposed to use a slot antenna, but this requires a removal of part of the solar cell panel which is undesirable.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
