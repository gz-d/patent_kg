The active layer 204 may act as a platform to seed/to accommodate the coupling agent 206. The active layer 204 may comprise any material that is capable o reacting with at least one of the functional groups of the coupling agent 206. Preferably, the active layer 204 is a gold nano-layer. The gold nano-layer 204 may be deposited on the membrane 202 by reported methods such as spin coating, vapor deposition, dip coating and the like. In this example, the gold nano-layer 204 may have a thickness of about 10 mm. As shown in FIG. 3B, after deposited with the gold nano-layer, the smooth porous membrane 202 is covered with a layer of gold nanoparticles, forming a rough layer thereon.\n\n[0053] The enclosed chamber 102 may include a compart- ment 106 for retaining solutions. The compartment is sepa- rated by the substance selection structure 104 disposed between the first and the second portions of the chamber, such that the compartment 106 is petitioned into two indi- vidual compartments 106A and 106B for retaining different solutions.\n\n[0054] Optionally or additionally, an O-ring (not shown) may be disposed opposite to a side where the substance selection structure 104 interacts with the target substance 112 for preventing any solution leaking from the respective compartments.\n\n[0061] As mentioned, the coupling agents 206 arranged to couple the receptors with the membrane 202. this example, the coupling agent may be an alkyl compound including at least one functional group that is capable coupling with the receptors 208 and the active layer 204.\n\n[0055] To perform measurement, the electrochemical detector 100 is connected to an external circuit through the electrodes 110. The electrodes may be made of any conduc- tive materials that are not reactive to the target substance 112. Preferably, the electrodes are made of noble metal such as platinum, gold and the like.", "type": "Document"}}
