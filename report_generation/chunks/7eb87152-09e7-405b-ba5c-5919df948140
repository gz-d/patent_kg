The essential oil has an aromatic structure and\n\nantimicrobial activity of the composition on gram - positive\n\ndifferent functional groups that exhibit distinct chemical\n\nbacteria and gram - negative bacteria . Compared to the con\n\neffects with the one or more monomeric units . Particularly ,\n\ntrol sample , the composition comprising the monomeric unit\n\nthe inventors have found that varying the amount of essen\n\nand essential oil advantageously exhibited anti - bacterial\n\ntial oil in the composition can vary the mechanical strength\n\nability in the presence of gram - negative and gram - positive\n\nof the composition and the hydrophobic material , particu\n\nbacteria . The bactericidal ability of the composition also\n\nlarly the essential oil , affect the mechanical strength by\n\ncorrelated positively with the content of essential oil in the\n\ndisrupting weak hydrogen bond crosslinks . Thus , the hydro\n\ncomposition , i.e. a higher weight ratio of essential oil in the\n\nphobic material disrupts bonding in the monomeric units\n\ncomposition resulted in greater bactericidal ability . Thus , the\n\nwhile at the same time forms non - covalent linkage with the\n\ncomposition of the present invention can be prepared as a\n\nmonomeric units . Accordingly , the content of essential oil in\n\nstructurally - robust , self - healing sustained release antimicro\n\nthe composition can be used to control or regulate the\n\nbial .\n\nmechanical properties of the composition and promote the\n\nformation of a gel - like consistency .\n\n[ 0113 ]\n\nIn another aspect , the present invention also refers\n\nto a method of preparing a composition , particularly the\n\n[ 0109 ] The inventors tested the effects of varying the\n\namount of essential oil in the composition by preparing\n\ncomposition as described previously .
