The resistor may be a chip resistor.\n\n[0018] In a second aspect of the invention, there is pro- vided a communication device comprising the filter-antenna of the first aspect. The communication device may be a wireless communication device. The communication device may be part of a communication system.\n\n[0009] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the absorp- tive filter further comprises: a defected microstrip structure arranged in the microstrip network and a defected ground structure arranged in the ground plane. The defected microstrip structure and the defected ground structure are operably connected with the filter element.\n\n[0019] Ina third aspect of the invention, there is provided method for making a filter-antenna, comprising forming a\n\na\n\na\n\n[0011] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch includes a central portion, and the defected microstrip struc- ture comprises one or more slots arranged (e.g., etched) in the central portion of the patch. The slot(s) may be U-shaped. The central portion of the patch may include one or more open stubs each associated with a respective slot. In one example, the patch has two open stubs, e.g., two ,/4 open stubs, where A, is the guided wavelength at the center frequency.\n\no.\n\nis\n\nthe\n\na\n\ntive\n\nthe\n\n[0014] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the defecte: ground structure comprises one or more slots (e.g., etched) arranged in the ground plane.
