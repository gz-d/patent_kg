In a specific embodiment, the implantable titanium alloys are fabricated by using plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PI- II&D), pressurized hydrothermal treatment, and antimi- crobial peptide coating. Advantageously, these specially modified titanium alloys are able to suppress the adhe- sion and proliferation of microorganisms. [0007] Embodiments of the present invention involve performing surface techniques to modify the surface of a material in order to form one or several antimicrobial layers capable of resisting microbial adhesion and pro- liferation. [0008] In one embodiment, the surface modification techniques include PIII&D and/or a pressurized hydro- thermal treatment. In a further embodiment, a surface layer is fabricated by using a technique for the immobi- lization of controllable release antimicrobial peptides. Ac- cording to embodiments, an assembly of surface modi- fication techniques, or a combination of one or more of the technique(s) disclosed herein and one or more of the existing technique(s) such as antibiotics coating or silver doping can be used to fabricate the surface layer(s). [0009] According to one embodiment, the surface modification by using PIII&D can implant various sources including ions, electrons, free radicals, atoms and mole- cules onto the substrate surface as the basal surface to inhibit microbial adhesion and growth. This basal surface is able to resist the attachment of microorganisms and the formation of biofilm. However, advantageously, this surface allows the attachment and growth of mammalian cells. In a further embodiment, reactive functional [0010] groups such as -OH and -NH2 groups are incorporated onto the basal surface, forming an intermediate surface\n\n2\n\n3\n\nEP 2 398 517 B1\n\n4", "type": "Document"}}
