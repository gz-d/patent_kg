Moreover, strokes are some of the primary causes of disability and death worldwide. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is facing a significant challenge in relation to strokes as a group it is currently the 4th leading cause of death in HKSAR. Each year, there are approximately 25,000 new stroke patients, accounting for 0.8% of its population. Specifically, every year, 3.2% of individuals aged 65 years and older suffered from strokes, which resulted in more\n\nthan 1,000 deaths as direct causes.\n\n25\n\n30\n\n[0003] A stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks the blood vessels that carries oxygen", "type": "Document"}}
