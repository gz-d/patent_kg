Synchro- nous rectifier techniques are primarily applied to various versions of DC-DC converters such as buck converters, fly- back converters, boost-buck converters, half-bridge convert- ers, and LCC resonant converters. To reduce the cost of the gate drive circuits, self-driven techniques have been an active research topic in synchronous rectifiers, although a gate con- trol integrated circuit for driving synchronous rectifiers is also commercially available. Other research aspects include the use of soft-switching techniques. Besides DC-DC converters, synchronous rectification techniques have been applied to three-phase full-bridge AC-DC converter based on a three- phase fully-controlled bridge and even to a five-level con- verter. While the self-driven technique uses the changing voltage polarity of the coupled windings to control the switching of the power MOSFETs, other techniques tend to use control integrated circuits to provide the gating signals. Another conventional approach replaces a general-purpose diode bridge with synchronous rectifier for low power and low voltage (e.g., 3V to 5V) applications in which the syn- chronous rectification technique is applied to a centre-tap rectifier topology. However, in such approach, a customized charge pump circuit is needed in order to provide a suitable DC power supply for the gate drive. Also, as this approach\n\nIt is desirable to be able to provide a self-driven AC-DC synchronous rectification technique that can be used to develop an AC-DC synchronous rectifier that can behave like a diode bridge and be used in high-voltage power applica- tions, but with significantly reduced conduction losses and. without requiring control integrated circuits. It is also desir- able to be able to use such an AC-DC synchronous rectifier in single-phase and multi-phase systems.\n\nSUMMARY", "type": "Document"}}
