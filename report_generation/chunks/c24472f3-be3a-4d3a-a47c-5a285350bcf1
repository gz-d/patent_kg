Forming the electric connection may include welding or soldering.\n\nIn one embodiment of the third aspect, the filter element comprises a resistor. The resistor may be a chip resistor.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nEmbodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings In which:\n\nFigure 1 1s a schematic diagram showing a filter-antenna in one embodiment of the invention;\n\nFigure 2A is a top view of a filter-antenna In one embodiment of the invention;\n\nFigure 2B is an enlarged view of a patch in the filter-antenna of Figure\n\n2A;\n\nFigure 2C is a side view of the filter-antenna of Figure 2A;\n\nFigure 2D is a bottom view of the filter-antenna of Figure 2A;\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n5\n\nFigure 3 is a flow chart illustrating a method for making a filter-antenna in one embodiment of the invention;\n\nFigure 4A ls a picture showing a top surface of a filter-antenna In one embodiment of the invention:\n\nFigure 4B 1s a picture showing a bottom surface of the filter-antenna of Figure 3A;\n\nFigure 5 is a graph showing measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the filter- antenna of Figure 4A and reflection coefficient of a reference antenna;\n\nFigure 6A is a graph showing measured and simulated radiation patterns of the filter- antenna of Figure 4A in the E-plane (x-z plane) at 5.8GHz;\n\nFigure 6B is a graph showing measured and simulated radiation patterns of the filter- antenna of Figure 4A in the H-plane (y-z plane) at 5.8GHz;", "type": "Document"}}
