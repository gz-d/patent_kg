[0044] One or more anchor members 30 can be used to join the support member 10 with the deformed spine portion 4. Similar to the above, the anchor members 30 can be activated to lock the support member 10 and the deformed portion 4 during or after the spine surgery, or both. Additionally or alternatively, the activation can be carried out either by a mechanical device, such as a screw driver or by a remote means, such as an electro- magnetic heating. In an embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 2, one [0045] or more anchor members 30 can be in the form of trans- verse traction members 32. In an exemplary embodi- ment, one or more transverse traction members 32 can be connected between the support member 10 and one or more vertebrae of the spine 2 via another anchor mem- ber 30. The traction members 32 can be in various forms and capable of providing a constant or substantially con- stant transverse traction force. In an exemplary embod- iment, the traction member 32 is capable of reinforcing or reducing the correction force provided by the support member 10. In another exemplary embodiment, the transverse traction member 32 is capable of independ- ently correcting spinal deformities. Exemplary transverse traction members 32 can include, but are not limited to,", "type": "Document"}}
