The taper angle @ should be a relatively small angle and can be calculated using the equation:\n\n97tan (Wig Woyp)(Lerannet)) @\n\n[0065] The position of the whole cell 116 is determined with reference to its distance from the inlet 120 of the microfluidic channel 118 which can be directly observed. under the microscopy device and is called \u2018penetration length L\u2019. A processor receives image data of the whole cell 116 from the microscopy device and, based on the image data obtained by the microscopy device, the processor determines the parameters associated with the deformed whole cell 116 at a first position and a second position along the microfluidic channel 118.\n\n[0066] The penetration length L determines the deformed length Wu along the microfluidic channel width direction. The deformed cell length Wy, can be calcu- lated using the equation:\n\ncell\n\nW seporm=\u00a5 ora Win channel Lt Win (2)\n\n[0067] The penetration length L also affects the cell length Lyeform Along the channel length direction which can be directly measured in the image captured by the microfluidic device 102. Based on the assumption that the deformed cell would have no change in its volume, the diameter D of the cell at its undeformed state can be calculated using the equation:\n\n@)\n\n[0068] It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the microfluidic channel 118 may include different shape, size and dimension. Any microfluidic channel that can releasably capture and deform cells in a non-destructive manner can be used in the quantification of the mechanical properties system and method as disclosed herein.", "type": "Document"}}
