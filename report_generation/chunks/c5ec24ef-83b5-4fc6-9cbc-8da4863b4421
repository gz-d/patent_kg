For instance, in system 100, switch 106 and switch 108\n\ncircuit. In another aspect, the SDGD subsystem can comprise\n\ncan be CCSD switches that each can be respectively con\n\na high-side portion, which can include SDGD component 112\n\ntrolled by sensing the current through Such Switch and can be\n\nand SDGD component 114, and a low-side portion, which can\n\nturned or switched to the off state whenever the current sensed\n\ninclude SDGD component 116 and SDGD component 118,\n\nacross such switch is reversed.
