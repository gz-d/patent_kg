In one preferred embodiment, the sulfur powders, and the ammonium perrhenate are present in the ratio of 7:1 by weight.\n\n[0018] Examples of the substrate suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, a mica substrate, a sapphire substrate, and the like.\n\n[0019] Examples of the inert gas suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, argon, and the like. In certain embodiments, in the step (f), the reaction chamber is purged with argon at a flow rate o 50-100 cm?/min, preferably, the reaction chamber is purged with argon at the flow rate of 80 cm*/min.\n\n[0020] According to embodiments of the present disclo- sure, in the step (j), the irradiation is performed in a humidity level of 30-80% in the presence of the inert gas for a period of 60-450 seconds. Preferably, the irradiation is performed in a humidity level of 60% in the presence of the nitrogen for 80 seconds.\n\n[0021] According to further embodiments of the present isclosure, the irradiation is performed via use of with two UV lights respectively set at the wavelengths of 254 nm an 85 nm.\n\n[0022] Other and further embodiments of the present isclosure are described in more detail below.\n\n. In a further aspect, embodiments of the disclosure includes a method of providing a wrinkle pattern onto rhenium disulfide (ReS,) flakes comprising the steps of:\n\n[0023] (a) providing ReS, flakes; and", "type": "Document"}}
