For instance, the capacitors C, and C, can be charged up to a defined voltage V, (e.g., approximately 13.0 volts (V)) in every charging period and can be discharged to a different defined voltage V, (e.g., approximately 12.0 V), which can be a relatively lower volt- age than voltage Vi, after each discharging period.", "type": "Document"}}
