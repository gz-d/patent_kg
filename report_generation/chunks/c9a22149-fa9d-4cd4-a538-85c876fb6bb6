(FIG. 12) for producing a para- bolic caustic xxz?. A spatial-dependent time shifting is introduced to the meta-atoms (FIG. 12) to form such a spatial-varying phase distribution at the m=-1 harmonic frequency. FIG. 13 presents the measured electric field intensity distributions at different harmonic frequencies. It can be seen that the universal metasurface antenna 400 can extract and mould the waves into an accelerating and non-diffractive Airy beam with a well-defined parabolic trajectory. Moreover, other undesired harmonic frequencies are highly suppressed in free space.\n\n[0166] In one example, the metasurface antenna 400 can also mould the extracted waves with spatial-varying momentum properties k,(x) for light-focusing applications (FIG. 14). This example considers the metasurface antenna steers the focal points from Fi to Fs at the m=\u20141 harmonic frequency. FIGS. 15 to 17 present the required space- dependent momentums, and the measured 1D and 2D elec- tric field intensity distributions for different focusing cases at the m=-1 harmonic frequency, respectively. It can be seen that the metasurface antenna 400 can extract and mould the propagating wave into intended focal spots, the positions of which are software-defined according to the applied STC matrix.\n\n[0167] beam\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible and shaping capability of the universal metasurface antenna 400, which may be particularly useful in sensing, and wireless power transfer applications.\n\nimaging,\n\nagile\n\nor\n\n[0168] The universal metasurface antenna 400 can enable facilitate information manipulation by generating time-\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nvarying wave properties (FIG. 18).
