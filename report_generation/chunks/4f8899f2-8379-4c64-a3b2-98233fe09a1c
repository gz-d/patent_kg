The results shows that CH value (55.04) of wearing angle at 90 degrees outperforms that (36.13) of wearing angle at 0 degree and that (24.12) of wearing angle at 45 degrees. Thus, the optimal wearing angle is, for example, 90 degrees.\n\nk,\n\n60\n\n65\n\nFor example, in this particular experiment conducted, the\n\ndata set measurement process included two parts. With respect to the first part, each of the wearers was asked to repeat each of the known microgestures (a)~(i) 40 times until he/she finished all known gestures in random order. In another experiment conducted, each of the wearers was asked to take off the detector DD and put it on again after every 10 times of recording so to increase the data variance. The data sets measured from the first part served as micro- gesture training data sets. With respect to the second part, each of the wearers was asked to repeat each known micro- gesture 10 times, and the known microgestures were shuffled randomly. The data sets measured from the second part\n\nserved as testing data sets.\n\ndata The\n\nare\n\nas\n\ncan\n\nUS 11,822,732 B1\n\n11\n\n12", "type": "Document"}}
