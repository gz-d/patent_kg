The tangential (H,) and normal (H,) components of magnetic field intensity near the conductive sheet, at R=1 mm, are plotted in FIG. 8. From FIG. 8, the tangential H-field (H,) is about 23 dB and approximately continuous at the boundary. The normal component of the H-field (H.) in conductive sheet is suppressed to about 8 dB and that inside the ferrite plate is about -7.5 dB at the boundary. Therefore, the normal component of the H-field is, merely about 0.09% of the resultant H-field inside the ferrite plate at the boundary. Accordingly, at the ferrite- conductive sheet boundary, the H-field is nearly tangential and confined inside in the ferrite plate. Besides, the normal component of the H-field emitted into the conductive sheet and the free space can be neglected in practical terms. Since the normal component of the H-field emitted into the con- ductive sheet is very small, the eddy current loss due to the H-field is also very small. This phenomenon is verified by the energy efficiency measurements of the ferrite-shielded PCB transformers with and without conductive sheets described below. As a result, the use of ferrite plates covered with conductive sheets is an effective way to shield the magnetic field generated from the transformer windings\n\nB. PCB Transformer Shielded With Ferrite Plates\n\nThe simulated magnetic field intensity of a PCB trans- former shielded with ferrite plates alone, under no load condition, is shown in FIG. 11. The simulated result shows that the magnetic field intensity, at R=0 mm and Z=5 mm, is about 28 dBA/m. The measured magnetic intensity, in z-direction, is shown in FIG. 12. The output of the magnetic field transducer, at 5 mm beneath the centre of the transformer, is about 128 dBuV. Therefore, with the use of 4F1 ferrite plates, the shielding effectiveness (SE), from the simulated result, is", "type": "Document"}}
