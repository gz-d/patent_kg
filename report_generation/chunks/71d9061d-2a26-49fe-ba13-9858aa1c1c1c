An embodiment of the invention herein relates to the use of a platinum(IV) complex according to Formula I for the treatment of cancer, a tumor, an infection, and a combination thereof, in a subject.\n\nExample 1\n\nSynthesis: Embodiments of the Platinum(IV) Complex of the Present Invention are Synthesized Herein as the Following Compounds\n\nFIG. 1 shows an embodiment of synthesis steps 4 and complex 5.\n\n[0106] complex\n\nfor\n\n[0107] Synthesis of compound 1 in FIG. 1: Ethyl acetoac- etate (1.9 mL), piperidine (125 uL), and 4-diethylamino- salicylaldehyde (0.48 g) are added into 20 mL ethanol to stir and reflux for 12 h. Then a NaOH solution (3 M, 20 mL) is added to reflux for another 3 h. After the reaction, the mixture is cooled down to room temperature, and HCl solution (37%) is added to adjust the pH value to 2.0 to precipitate the product. After centrifugation, the crude prod- uct is collected and recrystallized in ethanol to get the pure product (yield: 80%, purity: 99%).\n\n[0108] FIG. 3 shows a IH NMR analysis of compound 1 DMSO-d6.
