A\n\nductor or coaxial probe 124 of a coaxial cable 122. The\n\nUS 8,547,287 B2\n\n7\n\n8\n\nmaterial comprising the DR 116 also comprises a material that is transmissable to light at optical frequencies and/or above, i.e. visible and/or invisible light frequencies, and is preferably transparent in order not to reduce light energy reaching the underlaid solar cell 114. In fact, the focusing effect of the DR 116 considerably enhances the concentration of light energy on the receiving part of the solar cell 114 thereby enhancing the power output of the solar cell 114 over what would be expected if the DR 116 did not have a focusing function. The material of the DR 116 preferably comprises borosilicate glass such as borosilicate crown glass.\n\nDR 16 comprises a material that is transmissable to light at and/or beyond optical frequencies, i.e. visible and/or invisible light frequencies, and is preferably transparent in order not to reduce visible or invisible light energy reaching the underlaid solar cell 14. Preferably, the material of the visibly transpar- ent DR 16 comprises borosilicate glass such as borosilicate crown glass, commonly known by the tradenames \u201cPyrex\u201d or \u201cK9\u201d. This is particularly useful where the DR 16 is posi- tioned in an electronic device or on a circuit 10 in a light pathway 32 of another component such as the solar cell 14 or alight transmitting device such as a lamp or LED (not shown) or the like.", "type": "Document"}}
