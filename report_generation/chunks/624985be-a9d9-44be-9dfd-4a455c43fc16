Inven- tors of the present invention have devised that one of the sources of harmonic current comes from the transition between active and cut-off regions and another one of the sources of harmonic current comes from the transition between active and triode regions, and both transitions can alter the drain current waveform. Within one period, the time distribution difference between the active, cut-off, and triode regions may correspond to various operation states, which lead to variation of harmonic currents. The following dis- closure focuses on the second and third harmonics because the other higher harmonics are much weaker.\n\n[0172] The DC bias voltage and AC fundamental voltage at the transistor gate mainly determine the duration of the cut-off region. The DC supply voltage and AC fundamental signal at the transistor drain mainly determine the duration of the triode region.\n\n[0173] FIG. 7A shows the simulated drain current wave- form under the given DC bias and fundamental driving voltages as well as the gate and drain voltage waveforms. The fundamental waveforms at the gate and drain are out of phase so that the transistor can output fundamental power. Based on the setting in FIG. 7A, the transistor is already driven into the cut-off region. Then, the fundamental AC voltage IV, fol at the drain is changed to study its effect on the harmonic current output. FIG. 7B shows the correspond- ing results. Specifically, FIG. 7B shows simulated harmonic currents at the drain terminal of the transistor under different fundamental voltages at the drain terminal of the transistor, and three corresponding current waveforms at selected fun- damental voltage IV, fol.", "type": "Document"}}
