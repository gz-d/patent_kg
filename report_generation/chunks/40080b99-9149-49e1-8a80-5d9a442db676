It is found that the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively large cell deformation is significantly larger than the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively small cell deformation. This implies that\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al\n\nthe increase in the elastic modulus or \u2018modulus jump\u2019 is attributed to the nuclear modulus. In other words, the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively large cell deformation is contributed by the cytoplasmic and nuclear elasticities, while the elastic modulus of the whole cell under a relatively small cell deformation is contributed by the cytoplasmic elasticity only. Equations are developed based on a representative hyperelastic Tatara model describing cell mechanics to decouple contributions of the cytoplasmic and nuclear elasticities to the elastic modulus of the cell in respect of the relatively large cell deformation, thereby quantifying the nuclear modulus and cytoplasmic modulus.\n\n[0060] FIG. 1A illustrates a diagram of a microfluidic device 102 used for quantifying mechanical properties of a cell in accordance with an example embodiment. The micro- fluidic device 102 has an inlet 104 to receive a sample and an outlet 106 to dispense the sample. The microfluidic device 102 further includes two arrays 108 of confining microfluidic channels with forty microfluidic channels in each array. The microfluidic channels can be used to capture the cell for quantifying mechanical properties of the cell.\n\nof the cell is driven from\n\nair filter 110", "type": "Document"}}
