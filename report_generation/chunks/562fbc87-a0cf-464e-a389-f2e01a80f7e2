Bearing in mind that the Young\u2019s modulus of the GFRP bars is relatively small compared to steel or CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) bars, a beam with steel or CFRP bars would have achieved a smaller elongation of the reinforcement than that of this test beam. These analyses show that the deformation/ductility contributed by tension straining is very limited and a significant ductility demand cannot be satisfied without significant compression deforma- tion/yielding for beams reinforced with non-ductile rein- forcement.\n\nDiscussion of Experimental Results\n\nThe ductility factor of a member, lu is defined as the mate displacement divided by the yield displacement, or\n\n_ Ae wey\n\nREFERENCES\n\nACI Committee 440, Guide for the Design and Construction of Concrete Reinforced with FRP Bars, American Concrete Institute, Farmington Hills, 2001.\n\nDifferent definitions of yield and ultimate displacements were used in the literature. In this work, the ultimate displace- ments A,, is defined as the point on the softening branch of the actual response curve where the strength drops 20% of its peak value, as shown in FIG. 7. The yield displacement A, is the yield point of an equivalent bilinear response curve defined in FIG. 7.\n\nBayrak, O. and Sheikh, S.A.
