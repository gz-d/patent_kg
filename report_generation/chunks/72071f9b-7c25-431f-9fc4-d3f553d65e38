A projector component can project the one or more images on a projector screen component. The projector screen component can include a control region in a portion of the projector screen. The control region can be used to present the signal contained in a visual image to facilitate controlling processing and displaying of visual images. When the visual image is projected on the projector screen component, the signal can be presented (e.g., displayed or projected) in the control region of the projector screen component.\n\nAn active parallax barrier can be overlaid on the projector screen to enable the barrier to be transparent when 2-D con- tent is being displayed in order to present the 2-D content without being degraded. For instance, the active parallax barrier can allow a user to manually switch the active parallax barrier on for the display of 3-D content and off for the display of ordinary 2-D content, so that the 2-D content can be clearly displayed. However, such arrangement can be inconvenient, particularly due to the parallax barrier having to be switched on and off manually by a user.", "type": "Document"}}
