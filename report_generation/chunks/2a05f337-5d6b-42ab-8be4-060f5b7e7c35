The generator resembles a transistor and powered by impacting liquid such as water droplets. The generator has a glass sub- Strate defining an upwardly facing surface and a downwardly facing surface. The substrate includes 1) a region with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated on the up- wardly facing surface and acting as a virtual source and 11) an electrode arranged adjacent said PTFE coated region on the upwardly facing surface and acting as a drain in that the PTFE coated region and the electrode are positioned on the upwardly facing surface to receive an impacting water droplet acting as a gate, and wherein circuitry of the generator connects the virtual source and the drain via an electrical connection passing the downwardly facing surface, and electricity is harvested via the electrical connection.\n\nFIG. 1B\n\nwo\n\n[Continued on next page]\n\nWO 2021/078143 A | \u5587 \u5587 \u5587 \u5448 HI\n\nPublished:\n\n\u4e00 with international search report (Art. 21(3))\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\nLIQUID DROPLET POWERED ELECTRICITY GENERATOR\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention is concerned with an electricity generator powered by liquid or more specifically impacting liquid such as water droplets.
