To fabricate the TIDE-G, a piece of ITO glass slide of 30 mmx30 mmx0.4 mm was first ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol for 10 mins, respectively. Then, the precursor, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), was deposited on the ITO glass using drop-casting method, followed by heating at 120\u00b0 C. for 15 mins to remove all solvent in the PTFE precursor. The film thickness of the PTFE film can be adjusted by controlling the volume of precursor (Extended Data FIG. 13). To construct the drain electrode, a tiny conductive Al tape with a size of 1 mmx5 mm was assembled onto the as-prepared PTFE film. Control devices with PDMS thin film and commercial Polypropyl- ene (PP) tape as the dielectric layer were also prepared with the similar process. The PDMS film was formed on an ITO glass by curing a mix liquid of polydimethylsiloxane and curing agent (ration 10:1) with a certain of volume.\n\n[0075] lows.
