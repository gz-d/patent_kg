Preferably, the chamber may have a compact size such that a user may carry the detector 100 around easily and may be able to perform \u201cpoint-to- point\u201d screening. For example, the chamber may have a length of about 50-60 mm with a height/diameter of about 50 mm. That is, the chamber size may be comparable to a human palm.\n\n[0037] FIG. 6D is a photo showing the internal structural arrangement of the electrochemical detector of FIG. 6B;\n\n[0038] FIG. 7A is a plot of measured current against time showing sensitivity of the electrochemical detector of\n\n[0039] FIG. 6A toward different concentrations of antigen of gastric cancer CA72-4; and\n\n[0040] FIG. 7B isa calibration plot between the measured current values and CA72-4 detection, CA72-4 control detec- tion, and sensitivity HSA control.\n\n[0047] The chamber 102 may be petitioned by a substance selection structure 104 into two individual compartments 106A and 106B for retaining solutions 107A and 107B, respectively. Each of the compartments may include an inlet 108 connecting to the respective compartments for directing solutions thereinto. The detector 100 may also include a pair of electrodes 110 inserted into the compartments 106A and. 106B, contacting with the solutions retained in the compart- ments. The electrodes 110 are electrically connected to an external circuit thereby forming a conductive path defined by the electrodes, the solutions retained in the individual and the substance selection structure.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION I", "type": "Document"}}
