At 1008, the signal can be presented in acontrol region ofa projector screen component. Inan aspect, the projector component can present (e.g., emit, transmit, provide, etc.) the 2-D visual image and the signal embedded. in the signal region. The projector screen component can receive and present the 2-D visual image on a projector screen, wherein the signal can be presented (e.g., displayed or projected) in the control region of the projector screen. The barrier control component can detect the presented signal in the control region. The barrier control component can use the signal to facilitate automatically generating a corresponding control signal and transmitting that control signal to the bar- rier component to facilitate controlling selecting or switching of a barrier pattern mode (and/or corresponding barrier pat- tern) in real time to desirably present (e.g., project, present)\n\nmatically or dynamically, in real time), for example, to the barrier component. In an aspect, the barrier control compo- nent can transmit (e.g., communicate) the control signal to the barrier component. The barrier component can receive the control signal, and can select and implement a barrier pattern (in a corresponding barrier pattern mode) corresponding to the control signal. The barrier component can use the corre- sponding barrier pattern to process the 2-D video image to generate and present the processed video image (e.g., 2-D video image, 3-D stereoscopic video image, 3-D autostereo- scopic video image) on the projector screen component for\n\nFIG. 12 presents a flow diagram of an example method 1200 that can generate power, in response to an optical signal associated with a visual image, to facilitate powering a barrier control component and/or associated components, in accor- dance with various embodiments and aspects of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments, the method 1200 can be implemented concurrently with method 1100.", "type": "Document"}}
