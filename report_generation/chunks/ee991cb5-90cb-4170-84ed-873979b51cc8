The techniques used to modify the surface of the implant can involve PIII&D and/or other treatments such as a pressurized hydrother- mal treatment. In general, the newly-formed layer(s) pos- sesses antimicrobial properties and biocompatibility, thereby protecting the metallic surface of the implant from microbial attack and accommodating for the growth of mammalian cells. [0027] In an embodiment of the titanium alloy treated by oxygen PIII&D, the material surface of the titanium alloy implant is surrounded by high density oxygen plas- ma and biased to a high negative potential relative to the chamber in which the oxygen plasma source is generated by a high voltage AC/DC supply. The oxygen plasma ions are accelerated across the sheath formed around the substrate (titanium alloy implant) by an electromag- netic field and implanted onto the surface of the substrate (titanium alloy implant). Both the dose of the implanted ions and the depth of the implanted layer can be opti- mized by adjusting the plasma density, pulse width, ap- plied voltage and repetition frequency in order to enhance the antimicrobial property. [0028] According to an example implementation pro- viding surface chemical characteristics of the oxygen PI- II&D treated titanium alloys, the elemental depth profile is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) so as to reveal the surface composition of the sam- ples. For these samples, polished and cleaned medical grade titanium Ti-6A1-4V discs with 5 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness were implanted with oxygen plasma us- ing a PIII&D technique in accordance with an embodi- ment of the present invention.
