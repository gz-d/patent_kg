The encoding process may work as follows. The contents of the source block are predicted on the asis one or more reference blocks in the same frame (this is called intra prediction). The difference between the predicted block and the source block is called a residual block. The residual block is encoded by image transforming, quantizing and entropy encoding, as explained in the paragraphs above. The encoded residual block is stored together with coding data identifying the reference blocks and identifying the encoding mode used for the intra prediction. During decoding the predicted block is computed from the coding data and the source block is reconstructed by adding the (decoded) residual block to the predicted block. There may be several different possible intra encoding modes based on different block sizes or different positions of the reference block(s) relative the block.\n\nA video signal typically comprises a series of frames, each showing an image at one instant in time. When the frames are displayed quickly in succession they give the impression of a moving image. In order to reduce the data rate required to store or send a video signal, compression algorithms (com- monly known as a \u2018codecs\u2019) are used to encode the data. Such compression algorithms typically divide each frame into a number of smaller blocks, each of which is encoded.", "type": "Document"}}
