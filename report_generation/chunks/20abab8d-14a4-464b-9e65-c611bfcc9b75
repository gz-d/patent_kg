This is reasonable for mem- bers in which the tensile deformation of bars contributes to most of their flexural deformation, e.g. the under-reinforced beams or columns with low axial load level. For members without significant tensile yielding, such as over-reinforced beams and columns with high axial load level, the properties of the tensile reinforcement apparently have no effect on the extent of yielding and the plastic hinge length 55. This con- clusion can be seen from the compression yielding system where the extent of plasticity and the plastic hinge length 55 is determined by the properties of the compression zone instead of that of the tension reinforcement. This analysis reveals the possible deficiency in the existing model of the plastic hinge length 55. Apparently, the plastic hinge length 55 is largely governed by the extent of tension yielding for under-reinforced beam and columms with low axial load level. For over-reinforced beam or columns with high axial load level in which no tension yielding occurs, the extent of com- pression plasticity, which is ignored in the existing model, plays an important role in the plastic hinge length 55.
