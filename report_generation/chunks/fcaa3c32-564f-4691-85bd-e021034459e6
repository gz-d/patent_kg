Previously two different eye movement patterns at different states of a trial had been observed; they usually began with exploring both alternatives and then focused on the one preferred by the end of the trial and these two eye movement patterns were associated with different cognitive states. In the instant EMSHMM approach, it was assumed that the two eye movement patterns were associated with two cognitive states, exploration period and preference-biased period, respectively. A switching HMM (SHMM) was used to summarize a participant\u2019s eye movement pattern in the preference decision-making task. The SHMM contained two ROIs that corresponded to the two faces of choice; two low-level HMMs that summarized the eye movement patterns during the exploration and preference-biased periods, respectively; and\n\nhigh-level state sequence that captured the transitions between the two cognitive states.\n\nA summary of all participants\u2019 high-level/cognitive state transitions showed that on average they had a 55% probability to remain ln the exploration period, and 45% probability to transition to the preference-biased period, and remained there until the end of the trial (Table 2). When all participants\u2019 exploration period HMMs were summarized in one representative model, it was found that participants had a bias to start from looking at the stimulus on the left side and remain exploring there, and then switch to the right side (Table\n\na\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n41", "type": "Document"}}
