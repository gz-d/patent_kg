In FIG. 4, the x-axis represents the distance of electrons from the surface of the metallic arrangement (at the tip of the device) and the y-axis repre- sents the material energy barrier. Note that the device may already have been placed in an appropriate electric field that reduces the barrier. The graph in FIG. 4 shows three lines, each representing a different material M1, M2, M3 for the metallic arrangement. The material energy barrier with 0 eV represents the Fermi level. When femtosecond laser pulses are provided to the device hence the metallic arrangement, the laser excites the electrons to a high- (or higher-) energy level, sufficient for the electrons to overcome the energy barrier escape from the metallic arrangement.\n\n[0023] A method 200 for producing a device for providing electrons in one embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 2. The device may be the device 100 in FIGS. 1A and 1B. The method 200 includes, first, in step 202, forming an optical fiber with a tip and then, in step 204, arranging a metallic arrangement at the tip. In step 202, forming the optical fiber with a tip may include melting a portion of the optical fiber to form the tip, e.g., using laser. The optical fiber may be tensioned during the melting. The tension applied may be generally increased as the portion melts. In step 204, arranging a metallic arrangement at the tip may include applying one or more metallic coatings to the tip. The coating may be performed using electron beam evapo- ration or pulsed laser deposition.", "type": "Document"}}
