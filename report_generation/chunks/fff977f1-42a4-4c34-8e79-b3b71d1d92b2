To verify this, the present invention purifies vesicles from HEK293T cells and checks the total RNA of exosomes and whole cell lysates (FIG. 11a, FIG. 115). Indeed, quantitative RT-PCR analysis shows that the degree of enrichment of DANCR in exo- somes is 5 times that of cell lysates (FIG. 11c). In contrast, XIST is largely consumed in exosomes (FIG. 11d). The present invention also notes an interesting DANCR binding protein Ezrin (EZR) (FIG. 10d), a membrane-bound cyto- skeleton junction protein, which is associated with the poor prognosis of many cancers. RIP-qPCR verified the binding of Ezrin to DANCR IncRNA. Compared with the IgG control, DANCR IncRNA is approximately 2 times enriched in the Ezrin drop-down list, but it is not used for MALAT1\n\nIncRNA (FIG. 12a).\n\n[0115] CARPID is also performed in the present invention on another IncRNA MALAT that is known to be abundant in the nucleus but also present in the cytoplasm. Two groups of different gRNAs used for human MALAT1 can capture 484 proteins (22 peptides), of which 43 proteins are signifi- cantly enriched (FIG. 3c, FIG. 3d, FIG. 124).\n\nto\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\n[0116] In this study, among the three tested IncRNAs, the comparison results of CARPID that partially share the subcellular distribution results in the candidates with almost no overlap, demonstrating the high specificity of the\n\nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n<160> NUMBER OF SEQ ID NOS: 14\n\n<210>\n\nSEQ\n\nID\n\nNO\n\n1", "type": "Document"}}
