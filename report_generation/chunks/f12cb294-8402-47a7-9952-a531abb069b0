Host cells, e.g. A549, RD, PC3, or JEG-3 cells, were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicates, and cells were then pretreated with different compounds at different concentrations for 1 h before being infected with about 10 to about 100 MOI of JEV, ZIKV, or EV-A7I virus. After 8 to 24 h of infection, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and subject to DSRNA immunostaining and. DAPI staining. The images were finally captured by Cel- Insight CX7 High-Content Screening platform with a 20x objective lens, and analyzed in HCS Studio\u2122 3.0 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, Mass., USA) to quantify the percentage of infected cells versus uninfected cells.\n\n[0074] EV-A71, performed aforementioned assays to measure ZIKV, JEV and DE infection. The inventors particularly examined the localiza- tion of the virus replication in host cells by co-immunos- taining the host cells after JEV infection with DsRNA antibody and antibodies against different organelle markers. As shown in FIG. 10, DsRNA signal exhibited weak co- localization with early endosome (anti-EEIA staining), Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (anti-Calnexin staining), or lysosome (anti-LAMP1 staining). These data suggested that JEV replication complex is located at a novel membrane structure in the host cell.\n\n[0080] Inhibitory effect of berbamine and its analogues against ZIKV or JEV infection The inventors determined the anti-infection activity of berbamine, a bis-benzylisoquino- line alkaloid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine berberis, against ZIKV or JEV infection. As shown in FIG. 2B, berbamine, the alkaloid of Formula (1), significantly inhibited the infection of JEV in A549 cells, with ECso being 20 uM.", "type": "Document"}}
