It was found that group A (M = 29.0) had a significantly larger average number of fixations in a trial than group B (M = 13.3), t(22) = 4.44, p< .001, d= 1.75. Group A also had a larger average number of fixations in the exploration period (group A: M = 3.38; group B: M = 1.88), t(22) = 8.46, p < .001, d = 3.37, and in the preference-\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n37\n\nbiased state (group A: M = 25.61; group B: M = 11.5), t(22) = 4.10, p < .001, d = 1.62 (Figure 8B). However, after normalizing for the total number of fixations, group A (M = 0.147) and group B (M = 0.173) did not differ in the fraction of fixations in the exploration or preference-biased period, t(22) = -1.11; p= 0.28; d =0.45.\n\n<\n\nFurther, the hypothesis was tested that group A and group B differed in the number of\n\neye gaze switches between stimuli during a trial. Group A (M = 5.66) had more switches than group B (M = 4.10) on average, t(22) = 2.81, p = 0.01, d = 1.12. However, this effect was mainly due to group A having more fixations In a trial in general. After normalizing for the total number of fixations in a tnal, group A (M = 0.211) had a smaller fraction of eye fixations that involved switching between stimuli than group B (M = 0.328), t(22) = -7.20, 001, d = 2.97. This effect suggested that group A tended to explore a stimulus longer before switching to the other stimulus than group B. Note that since the clustering was only based on participants\u2019 cognitive (high-level) state transitions, these differences in number fixations per trial and frequency of switch between stimuli emerged naturally as a result\n\np\n\nof\n\nof\n\nthe clustering.\n\nEXAMPLE 15\u2014Inference of participants\u2019 preference choices\n\nIt\n\nwas\n\nalso explored whether the models\n\ncould be used\n\nto\n\ninfer\n\nan\n\nindividual\u2019", "type": "Document"}}
