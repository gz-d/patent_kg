Preferably, the hydrogel may be encapsulated by a polymeric layer that forms at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel. The polymeric layer may prevent water from escaping from the hydrogel structure, allowing the device being operable under the aforementioned harsh conditions.\n\n[0132] With reference to FIG. 1A, there is shown an exemplary embodiment of an electrical energy storage device 100. The electrical energy storage device 100 may be of any form that can capture energy produced at one time for use at a later time. In one example, the device 100 may be a battery. In another example, the device 100 may be a supercapacitor. In this exemplary embodiment, the electrical energy storage device 100 is a battery, particularly a rechargeable battery. The battery 100 may be of any suitable form that fits a particular application, such as flat-shaped, fiber-shaped, twisted fiber-shaped, coin-shaped, ball-shaped etc. Regardless of the shape of the battery, the battery may substantially have a high resistance to water loss upon subjecting to a dehydration process such as freeze-dry, boiling, and the like. The battery may also be substantially resistant to external mechanical force while the electro- of the is maintained.\n\n[0127] The inventors have, through their own research, trials, and experiments, devised that the failure of the electrical energy storage devices may be correlated to the stability of the electrolyte. It is appreciated that hydrogel electrolytes have been used various flexible and wearable electrical energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the inven- tors found that many of the hydrogel electrolytes suffer from failure as a result of the loss of water content from the electrolytes.", "type": "Document"}}
