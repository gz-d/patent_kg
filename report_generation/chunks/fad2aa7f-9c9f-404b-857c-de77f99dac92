As a result, brain cells are irreversibly damaged and begin to die within a few minutes. Thus, stroke patients' mortality and disability rates are very high. There are two sub-types of strokes: ischemic strokes and haemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes account for more than 60% of stroke cases. They are due to blood vessels in the brain becoming too narrow or blocked by plaques and thereby result in insufficient blood supply to the brain. In particular, large vessel occlusions (LVOs) are a subtype of ischemic stroke where either the proximal intracranial anterior or the posterior circulation are obstructed. LVO can cause a variety of serious neurological symptoms, including facial paralysis, dyskinesia, and language disorders.\n\nHaemorrhagic strokes, however, account for approximately 30% of stroke cases and are\n\nDocket No. UM1104HK00\n\n1\n\nHK 30057394 A\n\ndue to the rupture of blood vessels resulting in blood flooding into the brain. This causes severe damage to brain cells and can even result in cell death.\n\n5\n\n[0004] Medical data is diverse and highly complex. The use of machine learning and\n\ndeep learning methods to analyse medical data including structured, text, and images could better predict and help prevent strokes more effectively and thereby provide stroke patients with a more accurate diagnosis and more effective treatment. Therefore, a better stroke assessment system based on machine learning and deep learning is wanted in the art. Such stroke assessment system would be beneficial to both medical providers and patients as it can provide doctors with effective diagnostic support, medical decision-\n\n10\n\nmaking assistance, and in turn provide better services for stroke patients as a result.\n\nSummary of the Invention:\n\n15", "type": "Document"}}
