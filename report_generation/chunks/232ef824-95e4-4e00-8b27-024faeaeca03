The calculated required phase profile is shown in FIG. 13(g). For following clear illustration purpose, a local coordinate reference sys- tem (L1) is also defined, whose origin Ori is at the geometric center of Metalens #1 as denoted in FIG. 13(g). The direc- tion of the phase progression of Metalens #1 is always along the x,,-axis. When Metalens #1 is rotated, the local coor- dinate system L1 is synchronously co-rotated as well. In other words, local coordinate system L1 is turned by the same angle in the same direction along the z,,-axis with Metalens #1. Note that the global coordinate G is fixed whenever the metalens doublet is rotated.\n\n[0046] Design of Metalens #2.\n\n[0047]\n\nMetalens #2 is parallel to the physical aperture of", "type": "Document"}}
