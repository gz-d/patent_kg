A scratch (~700 jum wide) is initially created on the C2C12 cell monolayer, and then the scratch closure process is monitored by an optical microscope following electrical stimulation at different time points (0, 6, 12, and 24 h) (FIG. 3C). The scratch area of the group implanted with the present device is totally covered by the migrated C2C12 cells at the final time point when electrostimulation (200~500 mV, 8 Hz, 200 hs ) is applied, whereas no migrated cells are observed to cover the scratch area in the control group which is without electrostimulation. The scratch areas of these two groups at different time points are quantified, and the result is shown in FIG. 3D. There is a significant statistic difference between these two groups at time points of 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h (p<0.05, 0.01, 0.01, respectively). The group with the present device shows a higher scratch closure rate than that of the control group, indicating that the electrical stimulation has a positive effect on cell migration and wound healing.\n\nIn order\n\nfurther\n\nthe\n\nrelease", "type": "Document"}}
