This shows a great potential in various catalysis reaction. Furthermore, the metal nanoparticles on silver are free from other surfactants or reductants, reducing reaction activation energy barriers and thus leading to better catalytic efliciency.\n\n[0090] Ag nanoparticles exhibit extraordinary UV-vis light absorption, enabled by surface plasmon reso- nance, which is very promising for solar energy con- version and storage\n\n[0075] These observed remarkable enhancement behav- iors are ascribed to the densely packed Ag nanospheres 22 on the surface 20, which substantially amplify the near electric field, creating a large quantity of hot spots for Raman enhancement. As the \u201chot spots\u201d are evenly distrib- uted on the surface 20, uniform and densely packed Ag nanospheres 22 can be utilized as the sensitive SERS substrate with excellent reproducibility.\n\n[0091] Supercapacitors\n\n[0092] Embodiments of the present invention can be used to provide electrode substrate materials e.g. Ag substrates for supercapacitors.\n\n[0093] Sensors\n\n[0094] Embodiments of the present invention can be used to deliver enhanced performance for nanostruc- tured materials e.g. Ag substrates that are used as electrode in sensors.\n\n[0076] Overall, the SAN 10 with nanostructured surface 20 obtained here is very promising for commercial SERS substrate for rapid and label-free detection.
