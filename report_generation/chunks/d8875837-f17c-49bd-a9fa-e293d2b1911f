After that, the quartz boat B was put into the quartz tube furnace and was under the temperature zone II. At the same time, sulfur powders (100 mg) were placed inside a quartz boat A, which was then put into the quartz tube furnace and was under the temperature zone J. A flow of argon gas (300 cm\u2019/min, 10 minutes) was injected into the quartz tube furnace to fully replace the air therein, then, the flow rate of argon was reduced to 80 cm?/min. Then, the quartz tube furnace was heated to raise the temperature in the tempera- ture zone II from room temperature to 850\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at it for 10 minutes; while the temperature in the temperature zone I was raised from room temperature to 200\u00b0 C. in 30 minutes and kept at it for 10 minutes. After heating, let temperature zone I] cooled down to 600\u00b0 C., and quickly cooled down temperature I to room temperature to produce the monolayer ReS, nanoflakes.
