In an embodiment herein, the power of the NIR\n\nas\n\nmay be from about 0.01 W/cm? to about 4 W/em?; or from about 0.1 W/cm? to about 2 W/cm\u201d; or from about 0.2 W/cm? to about 0.8 W/em?, as this range is considered strong enough to both penetrate and activate the complexes herein, while also being safe for use on tissues, such as human tissues to reach the platinum(IV) complexes lying under the skin. In an embodiment herein, the power source selected from the group of a continue-wavelength laser, a ulsed laser, and a combination thereof. In an embodiment herein, the pulsed laser has an emission frequency higher than 1 MHz. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that as such NIR may be applied externally, and as NIR may be less damaging than, for example, UV light, which, due to its short wavelength and high energy, may otentially cause, for example, cancer, genetic damage, etc. Thus, unlike other photoactivatable prodrugs, which are activated by UV or visible light, it is believed that the present platinum(IV) complexes are suitable for use as drugs and/or prodrugs that can be activated by low-dosed near- infrared radiation (e.g., 880 nm, 0.4 W/cm?). Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the use of NIR in the present invention may significantly improve the penetration depth during treatment and/or decrease pho-\n\nis\n\ntotoxicity from irradiation.\n\n[0083] In an embodiment herein, the platinum(IV) is selected from the group of:\n\nplex\n\ncom-\n\nFomula II(a)\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\n-continued\n\nfe) rt\n\n;\n\n\\ CNV 2 \\ fe) oO fo) \u4e86 N -\u4e00 \u4e00 / \u516d fo) fo) oo HN > ; HBN byo O\n\n\u570b\n\nand\n\n7\n\nFormula\n\nII(b)\n\nFormula\n\nII(e)\n\nFormula\n\nIICd)\n\nJan. 26, 2023\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al", "type": "Document"}}
