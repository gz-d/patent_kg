FIG. 9 depicts the simulated power densities on the longitudinal plane for different separations of the lens pair (S=0.5, 4.5, 8.5 mm, respectively) at 300 GHz. It can be seen that the focus is moving away from the lens aperture accordingly. A large longitudinal scan range of 8 mm (8)o) can be achieved in the embodiment of the present disclosure.\n\n[0041] The focus of the antenna can be steered radially, azimuthally and longitudinally by synchronous counter rota- tion and co-rotation of the lens pair, and linear translation of the upper lens 2, respectively. Combining these three move- ments can realize a fully three-dimensional focus steering. FIGS. 10(4)-(6) show the simulated and measured power densities on three focal planes (S-0.5, 4.5 and 8 5 mm) at 300 GHz by combing synchronous co-rotation and counter- rotation of the lens pair and linear translation of lens 2. For each plane, the focus is steered along the lines of x-axis, diagonal, and y-axis. The results in FIGS. 10(a)-(b) are obtained by adding the simulated/measured power densities for all the focus steering cases on each focal plane. Again, although focusing scanning on only three lateral planes is shown in FIG. 10 for simplicity, the antenna can steer its focus at any position in the cylindrical 3D space with a diameter of 27 mm and length of 8 mm", "type": "Document"}}
