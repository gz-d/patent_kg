The length of exposure can be covered from the beginning of exposure to the time of examination or within a particular length of exposure time followed by a period of recovery time during which the teleost is bathed in medium without a testing agent. An agent can be dissolved in water or medium used to bathe the teleost. Alternatively, an aqueous-insoluble agent can be dissolved in DMSO in high concentration and, during exposure, added to bathing medium directly.\n\nThe embodiment is tested in wild type embryos at 52 hpf. Videos of heart and tail circulation are taken for analysis. Heart rate is determined from direct visual counting of the number of heart beats in 1 min. In addition, heart rate is calculated by the multiplication of basic frequency compo- nent in power spectrum with 60. Calculated heart rate is correlated with the heart rate determined by direct exami- nation of heart (FIG. 5). In addition, the cardiac rhythm is determined as the standard deviation of heart beat time\n\nBefore videoing blood cell circulation, the teleost is immobilized on a surface, for example, glass slide or plastic petri dish.
