The optical fiber 100 includes an elongated body 102 with a tip 102T. In this embodiment, the tip 102T is a nano-tip sized in nano-scale. The optical fiber 100 has a core 104 and a cladding 106 arranged around the core 104, as shown in FIG. 1B. A metallic arrangement, in the form of metallic layers 108 made with a material that has a low work function, is arranged at the tip 102T. The optical fiber 100 has an open end at which the metallic arrangement is arranged to allow the metallic arrangement to be excited by an energy source. The metallic arrangement can be made from chromium (Cr), gold (Au), or tungsten (W). The metallic layers 108 are arranged to be excited by an energy source (not shown) to emit electrons or electron beams from its surface. The energy source may be a pulsed laser source that transmits laser pulses through the optical fiber 100 (e.g., at the other end away from the tip 102T) to generate pulses of electron beams at the end of the tip 102T.", "type": "Document"}}
