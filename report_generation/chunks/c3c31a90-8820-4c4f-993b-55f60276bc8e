Mice were placed on the top of a 100-cm vertical pole (diameter of 1 cm). Video tracking system (ANY-maze, Stoelting, USA) was used to track the mice and calculate the descent latency by automated software. Recording was started when the mice began the turning movement and total time to descend to the floor was recorded. The test was repeated 3 times and the average descent time was used for data analysis.\n\n[0107] For walking track test, mice were habituated for 3 sessions over 5 days and allowed to walk in a narrow corridor covered with white paper strip (10x60 cm). The hind paws of the mice were painted red and fore paws were painted blue and the mice were allowed to walk on the white paper strip. Footprints were taken from each animal before and after treatment. Three parameters were calculated for evaluation of (1) stride length: distances between consecu- tive positions occupied by the right hind paw (2) Sway length: between the positions of the two front paws and (3) stance length: between the positions of the two hind paws (Girirajan et al., 2008).\n\n[0113] Based on the results, it is thus shown that the neurostimulation system of the present invention is useful and effective in modulating abnormal motor behaviour of a subject. The stimulation at DCN advantageously improves the motor activity of the subject, allowing the subject to move or walk faster and in a more stable manner. Accord- ingly, the neurostimulation system and the method of the present invention can be applied in medical applications such as for treating motor disorders associated with neuro- degenerative diseases, rehabilitation activities, and the like.\n\n1.
