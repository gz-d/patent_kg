The operation of this precoder device is equivalent to a trailing-zero digital precoder. In this example, the precoder device comprises a delay element arranged to introduce a delay to a plurality of sub-channels ofa signal at a transmitter end of the communication system; wherein the delay in a plurality of sub-channels are associ- ated with a process time of a receiver component at a receiver end of the communication system.\n\n[0053] Preferably, the delay element includes an analogue delay element, such as but not limited to an analogue delay-line built with printed circuit board traces connected. with each of the sub-channels. As appreciated by a skilled person, electrical conductors such as traces defined on a PCB introduces propagation delay to a signal to be trans- mitted between components, and the delay time is based on the length of the trace as the signal has to propagate a longer distance if the PCB trace is longer.\n\n[0054] Alternatively, other analogue delay components modules may be used to create such delays in each of sub-channel components of the transmitted signal.", "type": "Document"}}
