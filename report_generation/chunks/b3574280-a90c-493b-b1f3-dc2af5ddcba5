Lysine PTMs are highly prevalent in living organisms and play an important role in regulating diverse biological processes such as gene tran- scription, DNA repair, chromatin structure modulation and metabolism. Lysine lipoylation is a highly conserved lysine PTM found in a broad range of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. Functionally, lipoylated lysine is known to act as an essential cofactor for maintaining the activity of essential metabolic multimeric enzyme com- plexes, such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Dysregulation of lysine lipoylation leads to malfunctions of metabolic complexes and numerous diseases.\n\n[0011] In certain embodiments X comprises a peptide sequence of a protein selected from branched-chain a-ke- toacid dehydrogenase (BC! genase (KDH), pyruvate cleavage complex (GCV), KDH), a-ketoglutarate dehydro- dehydrogenase (PDH), glycine and histone.\n\n[0012] In certain embo group. iments R, further contains\n\n[0013] sequence of a protein sele toacid dehydrogenase (BC! genase (KDH), pyruvate cleavage complex (GCV), tains an alkynyl group. In certain embodiments X comprises a peptide cted from branched-chain a-ke- KDH), a-ketoglutarate dehydro- dehydrogenase (PDH), glycine or histone; and R, further con-\n\n[0004] Biological regulations of lysine lipoylation depend on proteins that function as the \u201cwriters\u201d, \u201creaders\u201d and \u201cerasers\u201d of lysine lipoylation. Dissecting lysine lipoylation at the proteomic level can reveal potential drug targets in the dynamic regulation of cellular metabolism. Thus, it is desir- able to identify proteins that bind or remove lysine lipoy- lation.\n\n[0014] In certain embodi ments Ri is:", "type": "Document"}}
