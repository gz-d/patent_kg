Neither harsh conditions such as vacuum and clean room nor sophis- ticated and expensive control systems which are gen- erally required by other micro-processing technologies are needed.\n\n[0070] In one example embodiment, a pulsed voltage with different potential extremes (P1, P2) are applied to the electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Ag dendrite 26 at nanoscale can be obtained at the surface of the metallic structure 10 as depicted in FIG. 3a and Ag hill-and-valley structure 27 at nanoscale can be obtained at the surface of the metallic structure 10 as depicted in FIG. 36 respectively.\n\n[0079] Silver metals acted as silver resources and deposit substrate at the same time. By contrast, for the previous methods, expensive silver salts are needed.\n\n[0080] morphological uniformity Ag nanostructure is conveniently achieved, due to the localization of Ag* in the stern layer and the suppressed growth of Ag nanoparticles enabled by the pulsed oxidation and reduction.\n\n[0071] In another example embodiment, upon the Cu salts are added into electrolyte during electrochemical oxidation and reduction, grapes-like Cu nanomaterials 28 and verti- cally aligned Cu nanoplates 29 are formed at surface of Ag and as depicted in FIGS. 3c and 3d respectively.\n\n[0081] Fine control of surface nanotextures and com- positions are easily realized by adjusting the electro- chemical parameters and additives in the electrolytes.\n\n[0072] Preferably, Ag metals 10 featuring nanostructured surface 20 is suitable for many different fields, such as energy storage and conversion, sensing, and surface-en- hanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The SERS perfor- mance of SAN obtained from the present invention is evaluated whereas the feasibility and advantages of the invented techniques for nanostructuring the surface of SAN is demonstrated.", "type": "Document"}}
