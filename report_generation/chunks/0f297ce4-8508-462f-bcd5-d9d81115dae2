Within the vacuum chamber is provided an implantation chamber 2 in which is located a sample holder 6 for support- ing a sample 5 to be implanted with ions. The implantation chamber 2 is a smaller chamber made of an insulating mate- rial such as glass which serves to protect the remainder of the vacuum chamber from contamination by the vapor that is supplied to the chamber 2 as will be discussed below. The implantation chamber 2, being made of an insulating mate- rial, also serves to electrically isolate the sample holder 6 from the exit opening 3 of the feed conduit 4 for reasons that will be understood from the description below. The implan- tation chamber 2 may be removed completely if the vacuum chamber 1 is to be used as part of a conventional PBII appa- ratus. The vacuum chamber 1 can also be removed com- pletely if the implantation chamber 2 is also used as the vacuum chamber to conduct FEFE-PBII. Sample holder 6 is formed at the end of a conductive rod 7 which extends though a wall of the vacuum chamber 1 through an insulating ring 8. An of the chamber 1 is with", "type": "Document"}}
