The metasurface structure includes a plurality of subwavelength units operable to manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum (i.e., all of these five properties) of electromag- netic waves for radiation. The subwavelength units may be referred to as \u201cmeta-atoms\u201d. It should be noted that the metasurface structure includes a plurality of subwavelength units operable to manipulate or control all of the five listed properties, the metasurface structure need not always oper- ate to manipulate or control all five properties at the same time; instead the metasurface structure can manipulate or control any one or more (up to all) of them at the same time. For example, the plurality of subwavelength units may be controlled by a controller to manipulate or control ampli- tude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum (e.g., all of these five properties) of electromagnetic waves for radiation.\n\n[0007] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum (ie., all of these five properties) of electromagnetic waves.\n\n[0008] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to selectively manipulate or control\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\namplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momen- tum of electromagnetic waves. For example, the plurality of subwavelength units may be operable to manipulate or control only one or some (i.e., not all) of the five properties at a time.\n\n[0009] In some embodiments, the plurality of subwave- length units are operable to dynamically manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum (le., one or more of these five properties) of electromagnetic waves.", "type": "Document"}}
