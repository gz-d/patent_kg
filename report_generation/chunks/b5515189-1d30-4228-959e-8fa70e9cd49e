Even switching to an ambient condition may reduce the evaporation rate of water, the water content of the electrolyte may eventually become zero in long run. In contrast, when the device operates at subzero temperatures, water may easily turn into ice and swell in the hydrogel electrolyte thereby inhibiting ion transportation across the electrolyte. Besides, when the hydrogel electrolyte is operated under water, it may absorb water and swell, resulting in loss of adhesion between electrodes and electrolyte. In addition, the exchange of solute between the electrolyte and water may decrease ion concentration of the electrolyte and therefore lower the electrochemical performance of the device even- tually.\n\n[0133] In this embodiment, the battery 100 comprises an electrode 102 and an electrode 104 being spaced apart from each other and an electrolyte 106 disposed between the electrodes 102, 104. The electrolyte 106 is sandwiched between and is electrically coupled with the electrodes 102, 104. The electrodes 102, 104 may function as an anode and a cathode, respectively or vice versa.\n\n[0134] Optionally or additionally, the battery 100 may also include substrates 108, 110 which may provide mechanical supports to the electrode 102 and/or the electrode 104. The substrates may also operate as a current collector to asso- ciate with the electrodes 102, 104, respectively. For example, the substrates may be electrically conductive and may be bonded to external electrical wires to deliver elec- trical energy to external electronic devices.", "type": "Document"}}
