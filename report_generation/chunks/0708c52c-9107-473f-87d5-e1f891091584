Unidirectional moisture transfer is successfully realized by surface energy gradient and push- pull effect induced by the distinct hydrophobic-hydrophilic difference, which can spontaneously absorb sweat from the skin and ensure bioelectrical signal stability. The directional moisture-wicking electronic fabric shows superior static sensing properties, high sensitivity in low-pressure area, wide linear range, rapid response/recover time. In addition, the STENG based on the electronic fabric can deliver a high areal power density of 0 to 21.6 LW mr and good cycling stability. With the superior pressure sensing and triboelectric performance, the electronic fabric can achieve all-range healthcare sensing, including accurate pulse monitoring, voice recognition, and gesture sensing. The present inven- tion provides a electronic fabric and/or skin for the devel- opment for the next-generation breathable self-powered electronic skins in the applications of Al, human-machine\n\ninteraction, and soft robots.
