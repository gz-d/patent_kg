The charging pad. should only charge the loads if they are compatible with the charging pad. For example, a cigarette lighter should not be charged even though its presence is detected. The choice of communication methods can be selected from at least, but not restricted to, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, ASK, FSK, NFC/RFID etc.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 10, the voltage source, V,, can be con- trolled by MCUp. The modulated power by using ASK (am- plitude shift key) can be transferred to the receiver and. demodulated by the demodulator at receiver side. The demodulated data are then forwarded to MCUs.\n\nThe handshaking method can be implemented with various forms of communication codes and protocols. In the follow- description, one such method is illustrated.\n\nThe above bi-directional communication can be performed by each charging zone independently of each other.\n\nWhile several aspects of the present invention have been described and depicted herein, alternative aspects may be effected by those skilled in the art to accomplish the same objectives. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such alternative aspects as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n\nThe basic implementation of bi-directional communica- tion by using amplitude modulation is shown in FIG. 10. Data can be transferred in both directions, i.e., from the receiver to the transmitter, and from the transmitter to the receiver.", "type": "Document"}}
