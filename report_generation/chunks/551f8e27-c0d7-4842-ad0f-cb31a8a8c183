The method com- prises a first phase and a second phase. The first phase includes using a three-dimensional hierarchical structure as a master structure; enclosing the master structure in an elastomer mold, where a Young\u2019s modulus of the elastomer mold is at least one order of magnitude lower than a Young\u2019s\n\n[0002]\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures are\n\nmaterials diversity for smart interfacial materials.\n\nmodulus of the master\n\nthe master struc-\n\n[0006]\n\nIn\n\nembodiment of\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nApr. 29 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0122091 A1\n\n2\n\nin PDMS ( Phase II ) .
