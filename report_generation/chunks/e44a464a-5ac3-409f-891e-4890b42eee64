The monomeric unit is end- capped by a ureidopyrimidinone dimer (shown in L-shaped blocks), which is associated and dissociated under certain stimuli, enabling self-healing of the composition when dam- aged and directional and reversible intermolecular self- assembly. Strong quadruple bond hydrogen bonding between the ureidopyrimidinone is represented by the L-shaped blocks, weak hydrogen bonding interactions between urea motifs in the one or more monomeric units is shown in cylindrical blocks, and hydrophobic material mol- ecules, particularly carvacrol oil molecules in a one embodi- ment, is shown in spherical blocks. The arrow illustrates the advantageous self-assembly of the one or more monomeric units and hydrophobic material form the composition.\n\nMechanical and Self-Healing Analysis\n\n[0139] For mechanical tensile-stress and self-healing tests, sample size of 30 mm lengthx6 mm widthx3 mm height, gauge length of 10 mm, and strain rate of 10 mm/min were adopted.\n\n[0140] The tests were repeated at least three times and the average values were recorded. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted on TA instruments (Q800 DMA). For self-healing tests, the polymer film was cut into two pieces and then put together. Healing tests on various samples can be conducted at different conditions. The healed samples followed the same procedure to obtain the tensile stress- strain curves. Rheology tests of gels were carried out by using Malvern Kinexus Lab* implemented with a 20-mm diameter parallel plate. The gap in the setup for rheological testing of the gels was 1.0 mm. Frequency sweeps were performed from 0.01 rad/s to 100 rad/s. Temperature sweeps conducted from 20\u00b0 C. 100\u00b0 C.\n\nExample 1B", "type": "Document"}}
