In this example, the method is arranged to monitor a plurality of wind turbines 502 of a commercial wind farm having K wind turbines (WT).\n\n[0075] This step of generating the models of the devices is preferably performed by training a machine learning system having learning networks such as deep neural networks (DNN). In a first instance, operation information or opera- tion data of each of the devices may be firstly obtained from a control or monitor system such as SCADA systems of the wind farm (402). The data may then be transformed and processed into files, such as spreadsheet files that may enable the data pre-processing 404 and further model train- ing 408 which follows.\n\n[0081] As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, an example of the facilitation of a transfer learning process is shown. The process includes two phases: a source domain learning phase 602 and a target domain learning phase 604. The source domain learning phase 602 is arranged to pre-train a model that extracts the common data patterns existing among all WTS 502, while the target domain learning phase can customize the unique characteristics of each WT by fine- tuning the pre-trained model using the individual dataset and thus allowing the individual pre-trained model, which has been fine tuned to a specific WT to model that specific WT.", "type": "Document"}}
