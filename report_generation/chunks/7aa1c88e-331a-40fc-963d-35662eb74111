Such an arrangement allows the induction surface to provide various induction regions to cater for different sizes of the secondary elements. Fig,6(a) illustrates this localized induction zone principle. Assume that the transformer array is divided into 4 zones (A, B, C and D). The transformer windings within each zone are connected in series to form one primary winding group with distributed magnetic flux feature. There will be four primary windings in the equivalent circuit as shown in Fig.6(b). If the secondary element is placed on Zones A and B, the equivalent electrical circuit is shown in Fig.6(b). Only the parallel primary transformer winding groups for Zones A and B are loaded because they can sense a nearby secondary clement that can couple energy from the primary windings. Therefore, they will generate magnetic flux in Zones A and B. Primary transformer windings C and D are not loaded because they have no secondary element close to them. Their equivalent secondary circuits are simply an open-circuit (Fig.6(b)). As a result, power transfer between the primary induction circuit and the secondary element takes place basically through the coupled regions (areas) of the induction interface surface covered by the secondary element. The non-covered area of the induction surface will transfer very limited energy.\n\nThis special design avoids unnecessary or excessive electromagnetic interference.", "type": "Document"}}
