In one example the flexible substrate comprises Polyimide or Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polycarbonate, Poly- propylene, Polyethylene, Polyvinyl chloride(PVC). In one example the p type semiconductor element comprises Tin Telluride (SnTe) or Bismuth Antimony Telluride (Bio sSb\uff0c sTe,), and the n type semiconductor element comprises Lead Telluride (PbTe) or Bismuth Telluride(Bi,Te,).

The thermoelectric device comprises a semiconductor materials and utilises the Seebeck effect i.e. a thermoelectric effect to convert heat flux (i.e. temperature differences) directly into electricity i.e. a current and volt- age. Current flows when the thermoelectric device is exposed to heat ie. a heat flux due to the Seebeck effect. Expressed another way a temperature gradient across the thermoelectric device causes a voltage i.e. potential differ- ence, which in turn causes a current to flow. This phenom- enon is due to the Seebeck effect.\n\n[0133] The term heat refers to thermal energy applied thermoelectric device.
