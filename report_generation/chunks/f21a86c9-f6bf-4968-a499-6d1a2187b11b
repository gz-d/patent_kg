For example, correction can be directed to the rotation around the longitudinal axis of the spine (apical vertebral rotation or rib hump), which is a typi- cal accompaniment of scoliosis.

After such support member is subjected to deformation force, the deformed support member is capable of providing a con- stant or substantially constant force, which enables the deformed support member to return to its initial formation upon the release of the deformation force. The constant or substantially constant force so generated can be used to fully or substantially fully correct various spinal deformities. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member can comprise a NiTi alloy. It will be appreciated that other superelastic or pseudoelastic materials are also within the scope of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
