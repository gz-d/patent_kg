The parts i to iv show the controlled formation of the elastic crack in PDMS (Phase I). The parts v to viii show the configurable seal/open of the crack in PDMS (Phase IJ). In Phase I, PDMS is prone to large elastic deformation and cracking: in Phase II, PDMS is relatively rigid and can keep the conformality.\n\n[0021] The invention includes all such variation and modi- fications. The invention also includes all the steps and features referred to or indicated in the specification, indi- vidually or collectively, and any and all combinations or any two or more of the steps or features.\n\n[0022] Throughout specification, context requires otherwise, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d or variations such as \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccomprising\u201d, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers. It is also noted that in this disclosure and particularly in the claims and/or paragraphs, terms such as \u201ccomprises\u201d, \u201ccom- prised\u201d, \u201ccomprising\u201d and the like can have the meaning attributed to it in U.S. Patent law; e.g., they can mean \u201cincludes\u201d, \u201cincluded\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and the like; and that terms such as \u201cconsisting essentially of\u2019 and \u201cconsists essentially of\u2019 have the meaning ascribed to them in U.S. Patent law, e.g., they allow for elements not explicitly recited, but exclude elements that are found in the prior art or that affect a basic or novel characteristic of the invention.", "type": "Document"}}
