For focus longitudinal steering, both the feed source and metalens #1 are kept stationary while metalens #2 is linearly translated along the z,,-direction. Since the incident field of metalens #2 is a plane wave, changing the distance between the two metalenses will not affect the incident phase distri- bution \u4e2d mc of metalens #2. From (4), it can be seen that the transmitted phase front of metalens #2 remains unchanged and hence the focus will remain stationary with respect to metalens #2 or local coordinate system L2. Nevertheless, in the view of the whole metalens or global coordinate system, the focus actually moves along the longitudinal direction. FIG. 16(4) shows the simulated power densities on the longitudinal plane for different separations of the metalens pair (S=0.5, 4.5, 8.5 mm, respectively). It can be clearly seen that the focus is moving away from the metalens accordingly by linear translation of Metalens #2. Of course, Metalens #2 cannot be infinitely far apart from Metalens #1 because too\n\nlarge a separation will reduce the energy captured by Met-\n\nof\n\nDec. 9, 2021\n\nalens #2 and deteriorate the focusing performance Never- theless, a relatively large longitudinal scan range of 8 can be achieved in this design.\n\n(8A,)\n\nmm\n\n3D focus\n\nThe focus of the metalens dou-", "type": "Document"}}
