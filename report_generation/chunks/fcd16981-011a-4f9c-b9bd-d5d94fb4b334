The method uses the highly specific CRISPR/ CasRx system fused to the promiscuous but efficient biotin ligase BASU. The interaction with various proteins plays a central role in the regulatory activity of IncRNA. The resent invention relates to a fusion protein of BASU and dCasRx, which comprises the dCasRx of compact Type VI-D CRISPR single-effect system, which can find the target IncRNA by specific gRNA co-transfected into the target cell. Once binding to the target IncRNA, it can enable BASU to specifically biotinylate effector proteins nearby activated by a high concentration of biotin. The biotinylated protein is separated by streptavidin affinity-coupled magnetic beads, then eluted, trypsin-digested and quantitatively analyzed by label-free mass spectrometry. As a control group, cells transfected with BASU-dCasRx but without gRNA are used\n\nas background.\n\n[0011] At the time of the results analysis, the proteins identified in the specific gRNA group are statistically com- ared with the control group (no gRNA) for enrichment or reduction. Rank product is a non-parametric statistical method used to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) of enrichment. In order to generate a list of specific interaction proteins, the critical value is set as enrichment=2 times and. FDR<0.05. The obtained protein can be used for gene ontology analysis or protein interaction network analysis. In addition, a comprehensive analysis is performed on the target protein by using gRNA targeting different regions, thereby obtaining a high-resolution spectrum of the target IncRNA interaction protein.\n\na\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\n[0012] In an aspect, the present invention thus provides fusion protein formed by BASU and dCasRx.", "type": "Document"}}
