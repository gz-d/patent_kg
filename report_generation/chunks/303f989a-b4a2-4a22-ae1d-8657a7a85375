The timing diagram 400 shows, with regard to the system 200 and system 300, for given times ranging from before time t, through after time t,, the respective states of various components, includ- ing, for example, transistor Q,, transistor Q3, switch M,, switch M,, transistor Q,, transistor Q,, switch M,, and switch Mg, and the levels of respective voltages, including v,,,, Vacs. Vesis Vacs: and V gs.\n\nReferring to FIG. 5 (along with FIG. 2), illustrated is a diagram of an example system 500 comprising a low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem in accordance with an embodiment. The low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem can include the SDGD component 216 and SDGD compo- nent 218. In an aspect, the SDGD component 216 can be associated with and can facilitate controlling the switch 206 (M3) (e.g., CCSD MOSFET), and the SDGD component 218 can be associated with and can facilitate controlling the switch 208 (M4) (e.g., CCSD MOSFET).\n\nTurning to FIG. 3D, illustrated is operation of the system 300 during the time period of time t, to time t,, the switch Ms can be switched to an off state at or near time t, and the switch Me can remain in an on state to maintain the switch 202 in an off state. Current can flow through the source drain diode of the switch 202.", "type": "Document"}}
