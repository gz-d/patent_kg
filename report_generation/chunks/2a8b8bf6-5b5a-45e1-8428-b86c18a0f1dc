In this implementation, the current sensor Rsen is used to sense the current feeding into the inverter. The sensed current signal is filtered and then compared with a desired current reference (Vref\u2014arbitrarily set at 2.5V) in an error amplifier 14. The current error signal (Ve) is the output of this error amplifier. Another current sensor Rs is used to monitor the current in the power switch of the flyback con- verter. This switch current is the same as the current in the primary winding of the coupled inductor in the flyback con- verter. The sensed switch current (Vipk) is filtered and then compared with Ve at comparator 15 in order to generate the PWM signal for driving the switch of the flyback converter. The objective is to for the first-stage converter to feed a desired level of current into the second-stage inverter. The second-stage inverter is simply driven at constant frequency (at the resonant frequency of the resonant tank in the primary circuit) to inject an AC current of constant magnitude into the primary circuit of the charging pad. The resonant tank of the primary circuit ensures that current in the primary winding is sinusoidal in order to reduce harmonic losses and EMI radia- tion.", "type": "Document"}}
