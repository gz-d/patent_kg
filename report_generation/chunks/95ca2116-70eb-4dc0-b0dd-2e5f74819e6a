The desired relatively small posi- tive signal can be generated from the rectified voltage (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 1), and such signal can ensure or at least substantially ensure that operation of the comparators CP, and CP, can be controlled to turn switch 208 and switch 204 to an off state at or before a desired time, to facilitate prevent- ing an undesirable (e.g., fatal) short circuit in the system 200. The system 700 (and system 200) can include a zener diode D-_,, which can have a predefined rating voltage parameter value (e.g., rating voltage at or approximately 10.0 V). When the rectified voltage begins to rise from zero voltage, the voltage of the zener diode D,, can rise until it reaches its predefined rating voltage. Once the zener diode D,, attains its predefined rating voltage, the zener diode D_, can maintain this voltage level with very little voltage fluctuation. In another aspect, the system 700 (and system 200) can include resistors R,, (e.g., 10.0 MQ) and Rs (e.g., 43.0 kQ) that can form a voltage divider to facilitate producing a scaled-down voltage signal with relatively reduced voltage fluctuation, wherein the scaled-down voltage signal can be provided to a diode Di associated with the comparators CP, and CP. The rising period and falling period of the scaled-down voltage\n\nIn the prototype, R=R5=1.3MQ; R,=1M=z; R,=0.002Q; Rps(onj70-045Q; V-<1.1V at 30 A (V=1V is assumed for calculation).\n\nWhen V,,,,=V;,-L10V, Pp,ive-%31 milliwatts (mW), the current range is 0.016<I/<21.724 A.
