Due to features such as wide bandwidth, non-ionizing properties, and penetration capabilities, terahertz radiation-based devices open up new possibilities for non-destructive detection, material charac- terization, and high-resolution imaging. Focus-steering devices are essential for these terahertz applications for fast detection tracking, and imaging. The first generation of terahertz imaging systems have largely adopted mechanical apparatuses to move the entire system to manipulate the focus with intrinsic limits in weight, integration and imaging\n\ntime.", "type": "Document"}}
