In step 1201, generating, by a source unit, a polychromatic light beam containing p-polar- ized beam and s-polarized beam. In step 1202, introducing, by an interferometric unit, birefringent retardation for gener- ating optical path difference between the p-polarized beam and the s-polarized beam. In step 1203, introducing a SPR effect associated with the target sample to the p-polarized beam. In step 1204, detecting target sample characteristics by obtaining an interference spectrum of the p-polarized beam and the s-polarized beam from the SPR sensing unit.\n\nAccording to an embodiment, an extra optical path differ- ence is introduced between the p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam at each wavelength, and the amount of extra optical path difference is adjusted in time domain.\n\nAccording to an embodiment, a beam of broad spectral range light containing random polarized beam is emitted by a source, the wavelengths of light beam emitted from the source is selected by a filter, the light beam is converted into parallel light beam with planar wavefront by a collimator, and a con- tent ratio between the p-polarized and s-polarized compo- nents is selected by a polarizer.\n\nThe present application is based on the exploitation of wavelength dependent phase of a spectral interrogating SPR system via common-path carrier-frequency-modulated dif-\n\nanalyzer. Specifically, the curves from curve 1001 to curve\n\ndynamic range for both arrangements. The polychromatic spectral phase-sensitive SPR\n\nsensor", "type": "Document"}}
