It implies that the treated surfaces are mechanically stronger than the NiTi substrates underneath and can withstand mechanical shock more effectively. Among the treated surfaces, the nitro- gen-implanted layer has the largest H and E, followed by the acetylene- and oxygen-implanted layers.\n\nFIG. 1 indicates the Ni concentration profiles of the samples with and without PIII surface treatment. The Ni concentrations in the implanted region in nitrogen, acetylene and oxygen plasma-implanted samples are much lower when. compared to the non-coated control sample. Nitrogen PIII gives rise to the highest Ni suppression compared to oxygen. PHIL.", "type": "Document"}}
