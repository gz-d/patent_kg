In accordance to various embodiments, the audio processing system 10 includes an audio source 100, a signal output 110, and a processor 120. The method inputs audio signal AS1 through the audio source 100, and the audio signal AS1 is processed and provide to a user.\n\n30\n\nThe extracted FO is then mixed with the original music recordings. Moreover, a user may adjust the volume of the FO melody before mixing with the original music recordings until the music sounded most pleasant to the user. The adjusted volume is then saved as one of the parameters of the hearing profile of the audio processing system 10, and the hearing profile of the user of the hearing device (signal output 110) is determined (Step $21). In other words, the hearing profile is made to correspond to the audio source 100, the signal output 110, and the processor 120 of the audio processing system 10, and the method for processing audio signal AS1 (Step $22) may incorporate a user-adjust- able calibration process, allowing each user to configure the music signal processing accordingly to allow for enhance- ment of musical features specific to that person\u2019s prefer- ences and the electrical characteristic of their CI hardware, hearing loss, and the resulting artifacts.", "type": "Document"}}
