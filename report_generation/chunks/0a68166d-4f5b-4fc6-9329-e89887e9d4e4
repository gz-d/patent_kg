The method of claim 1, wherein the sensed output signal\n\ncomprises a Voltage signal sensed across an output capacitor\n\ndrive circuitry and control circuitry operations in the control\n\n65\n\ncomponent of said regulator, said output capacitor compo\n\nler. Of these two power Supply Voltages, a +5 V Supply Voltage\n\nnent being arranged in parallel with an output load impedance\n\ncalled VCC or AVDD is the one after a RC filter.\n\nUS 8,169,201 B2\n\n15\n\n16\n\nAs shown in FIG. 17, the voltage regulators may receive power supply inputs in addition to the power circuitry input Vin rail that is being regulated. Thus, for example, as shown aVdd supply input 542 may be utilized anda Vcc supply input 544 filtered by a RC filter after Vdd may also be utilized. The Vdd supply input 542 may act as a power supply for the MOSFET gate drive circuitry and the Vce supply input 544 may act as a power supply for the analog and/or digital control circuitry within the regulator.\n\norder to apply said compensating signal to said output passive component to thereby reduce said difference between the level of the reference voltage signal and the sensed output voltage signal.\n\nFIG. 15 comprises a switched-mode power supply 310 having a voltage regulator 110, 210 according to any of the examples of the invention for regulating an output power supply signal of the voltage regulator according to a reference voltage signal applied to the voltage regulator 110, 210 for providing said regulated output power supply signal to at least one component of the switched-mode power supply 310.\n\nConsequently, FIG. 17 provides at least a dual power source regulated power supply having at least one voltage regulator according to the invention.", "type": "Document"}}
