The microneedles are preferably made of PLGA, and further coated with Mg/W such that their surface becomes electrically conductive. An SEM image in FIG. 1) demonstrates that from the bottom view of the microneedle patch made of PLGA coated with Mg/W the surface of the microneedles is uniform. FIG. 1E shows an enlarged image\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\nof the PLGA microneedle patch coated with Mg/W from a perspective view, where the microneedles have a light reflecting surface because of the presence of metal coating. Various chemicals such as Rhodamine B can be loaded in PLGA microneedle tips, which can be visualized in the florescence image (FIG. 1F).\n\n[0152]\n\nIn certain embodiments, the multi-layered antenna", "type": "Document"}}
