The oscillator arrangement is operable to generate third har- monic power (e.g., in the form of electric current or voltage). The patch antenna arrangement 2604 is operably coupled with the oscillator arrangement for radiating terahertz elec- tromagnetic radiation based on the third harmonic power generated by the oscillator arrangement.\n\nthe\n\noscillators\n\n[0105] In some embodiments, 26024, 2602B are arranged to differentially feed the patch antenna arrangement 2604.\n\n[0106] The oscillator 2602A of the oscillator arrangement is operable to generate third harmonic power (e.g., in the form of electric current or voltage). The oscillator 2602A may include a transistor arrangement and associated circuit arrangement.\n\n[0107] In some embodiments, the oscillator 2602A includes two transistors each having a gate terminal, a source terminal, and a drain terminal. The two transistors may each respectively be a solid-state electronic device such as a silicon-based solid-state electronic device. For example, the two transistors may each be a field effect transistor (FET). The two transistors may each respectively be arranged (e.g., controlled) to selectively operate in (e.g., transition among) an active region, a cut-off region, and a triode region for facilitating generation of third harmonic power. In some embodiments, the two transistors are oper- ably coupled to operate in phase.", "type": "Document"}}
