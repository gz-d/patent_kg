As long as the size of the short vector that needs to be sampled is relatively small, the extension of clock cycle is a better trade-off.\n\n[0111] In order to analyze the performance of these mod- ules, namely NTT, PWM, PWA, and SHAKE modules, each of these modules is tested individually. Note that during the individual module test, the 64-bit width input and output FIFOs are also included and configured as read and write interfaces. The target platform is the Xilinx ZedBoard, which is based on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 XC7Z020-1 device. The implementation results in terms of hardware resources\u3002\u3002 are shown in the table below:\n\n_\n\n[0114] The PWA module 102C computes point-wise addi- tion and subtraction of two polynomials. The negation of the numbers for subtraction is hidden in the pipeline. The PWA module can also be configured to compute the pointwise addition of polynomial vectors. The modular addition unit number is set to two to match the data transmission speed of an we FIFOs. The computing time mainly includes n/2 cycles for data reading of the first polynomials and n/2x(I-1) cycles of point-wise addition. The vector length is parameter config- urable. When set the tested length I=5 (ie. the length of NIST security level 3), the cycle cost is 665.\n\nHW Module LUT Slice FE DSP BRAM Fmax NTT/ANIT 799 328 971 2 45 PWM 561 257 796 4 3 PWA 527 209 645 0 4 SHAKE 8472 2411 5035 0 2 HW_ACC_IP 9365 2826 6811 4 5 PL_HW_system 13128 (24%) 4379 (32%) 11556 (10%) 4 (1.8%) 14 (10%)\n\n(MHz)\n\n172\n\n178\n\n238\n\n169\n\n161\n\n150\n\nthe cycles count for different parameter settings shown in the table as follows:\n\nwhile\n\nHW Module Function HW cycles NTTINTT ntt (n = 256) 1405 intt (n = 256) 1405 PWM et wise al \u5168 \u540c ait PWA point _wise_add (1 = 2) 265 point_wise_sub (1 = 2) 265 point_wise_add (I = 5) 665 SHAKE Hos6 (32, 96) 81 Hose (1952, 48) 161 His + rej_uniform (n = 256) 284 Hing + rej_eta_4 (n = 256) 302 Hyog + rej_eta_2 = 256) 214", "type": "Document"}}
