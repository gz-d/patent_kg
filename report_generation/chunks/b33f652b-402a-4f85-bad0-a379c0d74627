Fortunately, long term survival is possible if patients present at an early stage. Thus, diagnostic tools enabling the screening test of cancer become of paramount importance.\n\n[0042] In view of the above, it may be desirable to have a low cost cancer screening in the asymptomatic general population. However, it is appreciated that many of the screening methods/devices used in the art require invasive sample collection or time-consuming analysis, whilst both of which may further require a trained person to operate.\n\n[0048] The substance selection structure 104 may selec- tively interact with a target substance 112 in the solutions. Upon interaction, one or more molecules of the target substance may be captured by the substance selection struc- ture, rendering a reduction of quantity of the target substance in the solution. As a result, the electrical characteristic of the conductive path is altered. Thus, the presence and/or the amount of the cancer biomarkers in a sample may be indicated based on the electrical characteristic altered by the interaction.\n\n[0043] The inventors have, through their own research, trials and experiments, devised that aptamers (ie. RNA or DNA oligonucleotides or peptides) possess structural domains that are capable of recognizing a wide variety of targets such as ions, toxins, bacteria, viruses, cells, and tissues with high selectivity and sensitivity. In addition, the aptamers can be functionalized on different material easily. Thus, an electrochemical detector containing said aptamers may be desirable to provide a low cost, highly selective, and highly sensitive cancer screening.", "type": "Document"}}
