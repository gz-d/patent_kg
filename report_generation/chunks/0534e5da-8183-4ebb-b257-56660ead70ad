Titanium oxides are known to be fairy compatible with living tissues [17-20]. They are also inactive to many chemical reactions. In surface coating industries, these elements have been applied to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties of the substrates through various methods [21-25] for a period of time.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention provides a method for the altering surface composition of a nickel titanium alloy part to increase bio- compatibility, comprising implanting nitrogen, oxygen or carbon on the surface of the nickel titanium alloy part by plasma immersion ion implantation, or deposition, or ion beam immersion or implantation. The surface may also be altered by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition or related ion-beam and plasma-based techniques such as plasma-enhanced vapor phase deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (VPD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).\n\nUSS. which\n\nof\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nand\n\npulse duration to 5000 Hz.
