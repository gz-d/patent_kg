Because an absolute value is used, the sign (positive or negative) of the coefficient f,,* can be ignored in the look up process and introduced later to ensure that the i* and/or zy values are given the right sign. This makes the comparison process simpler and quicker and sim- pler (as only positive values have to be compared in the look up process and the look up table does not have to contain negative values).\n\ne) computing a sum of squared differences between f,,* and i\u2019.\n\nAS \u2018the sum of squared differences is calculated in the residual domain, it is not necessary to reconstruct the block in order to calculate the distortion. This saves some processing time. Furthermore, as the sum of squared differences is cal- culated in the transform domain, further processing is saved as it is not necessary to carry out the inverse image transform to calculate the distortion. In addition, as the method uses an integer image transform, the coefficients f,,*, will be integers. The coefficients f,,* may be integers or fractional numbers.\n\nto\n\na\n\nnal\n\nthe\n\noriginal\n\nS\n\nand\n\na\n\n.\n\nthe\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65", "type": "Document"}}
