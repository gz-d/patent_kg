The two groups also showed interesting differences ln the temporal dynamics of eye movement patterns throughout a trial. More specifically, participants in group A entered the preference-biased period later than group B (FIGURE 8A) but had a stronger cascade effect. In addition, group A\u2019s preference over the two alternatives could not be inferred with above-chance performance using early fixations of a trial until the first 90% of the fixations were used. In contrast, group B\u2019s preference could be inferred with above-chance performance with only the first 75% of the fixations (FIGURE 9A). However, when only the fixations during the final 2 seconds before the decision response were used, group A\u2019s preference was inferred with a higher accuracy than group B. This phenomenon showed that although participants ln group A revealed their preference in the eye movement patterns later in a trial than group B, their eye movement patterns contained more information for inferring their preferences. Recent research has suggested that indecisiveness, or decisional procrastination, is associated with informational tunnel vision: indecisive individuals tend to gather more information about the item that is eventually chosen while ignoring information about other alternatives. Accordingly, in the instant study participants in group B have exhibited a more \u2018indecisive\u2019 eye movement pattern than group A, since they entered the preference-biased period earlier, spent proportionally less time in the exploration period, and switched more frequently between the two stimuli for choice, which may be characteristics of informational tunnel vision.
