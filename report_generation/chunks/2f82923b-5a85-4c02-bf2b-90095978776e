Input valve 12 is provided with a valve heating means 13 similar to heating device 16 in order to prevent the sulfur vapor being deposited in the input valve 12 or in the feed conduit 4. The vaporized sulfur then passes along the feed conduit 4 (which is surrounded by an insulating wall 11 again to prevent cooling and deposition of the sulfur) to the exit opening 3 into the implantation chamber 2. Optionally, means may be provided for supplying an inert carrier gas such as argon to facilitate the transfer of the sulfur vapor along the feed conduit 4. The carrier gas can be fed in from side wall of the evaporation chamber 17 or other places around the cham- ber not shown here.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS", "type": "Document"}}
