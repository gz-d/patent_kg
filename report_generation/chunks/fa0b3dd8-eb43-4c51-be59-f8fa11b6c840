An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic material comprising volatile chemical com- pounds. The essential oil has an aromatic structure and different functional groups that exhibit distinct chemical effects with the one or more monomeric units. Particularly, the inventors have found that varying the amount of essen- tial oil in the composition can vary the mechanical strength of the composition and the hydrophobic material, particu- larly the essential oil, affect the mechanical strength by disrupting weak hydrogen bond crosslinks. Thus, the hydro- phobic material disrupts bonding in the monomeric units while at the same time forms non-covalent linkage with the monomeric units. Accordingly, the content of essential oil in the composition can be used to control or regulate the mechanical properties of the composition and promote the\n\n[0112] assay was to test antimicrobial activity of the composition on gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. Compared to the con- trol sample, the composition comprising the monomeric unit and essential oil advantageously exhibited anti-bacterial ability in the presence of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal ability of the composition also correlated positively with the content of essential oil in the composition, i.e. a higher weight ratio of essential oil in the composition resulted in greater bactericidal ability. Thus, the composition of the present invention can be prepared as a structurally-robust, self-healing sustained release antimicro-\n\n[0113] In another aspect, the present invention also refers to a method of preparing a composition, particularly the composition as described previously. The method comprises the steps of (a) providing one or more monomeric units having a structure of Formula (I):", "type": "Document"}}
