One laser pulse may increase the photoacoustic amplitude generated by the following laser pulses (e.g., because an earlier laser pulse may increase the photoacoustic excitation efficiency F of a subsequent laser pulse). This may cause a systematic error in sO, calculation. With system calibration, it has been shown above that the error can be compensated for in the sO, imaging. In vivo sO,\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\ncomparison results are shown in FIGS. 5A to 6E. The laser\n\nrepetition rate is 4 kHz. Pulsed energy for each wavelength is ~80 nJ. The imaging area is 8.75 mmx10 mm. FIG. 5A shows the normalized hemoglobin concentration imaged at 532 nm. The system has enough SNR (>20 dB) to show the capillaries. The blood flow speed calculated by the dual- pulse method is shown in FIG. 5B. Four artery-vein pairs of vessels labelled with the lines are selected to plot profiles of the blood flow speed, as shown in FIGS. 6A to 6D. From the root to the tip of the ear, the blood flow speed in the artery decreases from ~7 mm/s to ~3.3 mm/s, and in the vein, the flow speed maintains ~2 mm/s. sO, images without and with compensation are shown in FIGS. 4C and 4D. Artery-vein pairs labeled with the lines are selected to compare the sO, values. As shown in FIG. 6E, without compensation, the artery sO, values at the first to the fourth spots are 0.9420.01 (SE), 0.92+0.02 (SE), 0.91+0.02 (SE) and 0.90+0.02 (SE), and the vein sO, values at the same spots are 0.56+0.01 (SE), 0.520.02 (SE), 0.50+0.02 (SE), 0.50+0.01 (SE). With com- pensation, the artery sO, values increase to 0.98+0.02 (SE), 0.96#0.02 (SE), 0.9520.02 (SE), 0.94+0.01 (SE), and the vein sO, values become 0.69+0.02 (SE), 0.6420.02 (SE),\n\n0.6320.02 (SE), 0.63+0.01 (SE).", "type": "Document"}}
