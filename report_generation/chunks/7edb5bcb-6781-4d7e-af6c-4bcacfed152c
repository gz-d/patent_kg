The biodegradable polymer(s) are mixed with surface-treated biodegradable metallic material(s) through a thermal-mechanical process. The thermal-me- chanical process includes five main steps: melt polymer by thermal process; add metallic powder into melt polymer to form pre-hybrid material; shear pre-hybrid material in x and y axis; compress pre-hybrid material along the direction of z axis; and the shearing and compression steps are repeated until a hybrid material with evenly distributed components is achieved. The thermal-mechanical mixing device of FIG. 2 has been designed to carry out the thermal-mechanical process. The mixing device can be programmed to make a specific environment for fabricating different compositions\n\nTABLE 9\n\n150 jm Magnesium beads with pre-heat treatment", "type": "Document"}}
