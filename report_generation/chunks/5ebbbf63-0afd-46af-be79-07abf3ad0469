The term \u201cconnect\u201d encompasses any type of interaction which allows the formation of a network as described herein, and includes, without limitation, nonco- valent bonding, for example, hydrogen bonds, metal-ligand interactions, pi interactions, ionic bonds, Van de Waals interactions, hydrophobic bonds, other reversible interac- tions and the like, and covalent bonding. In an example, the one or more monomeric units connect to each other via a host-guest interaction through non-covalent bonding that maintains the 3D structure of the one or more monomeric units. In an embodiment herein, the monomeric unit forms at least one hydrogen bond with adjacent monomeric unit, thereby forming a crosslinked network. In another example embodiment, the one or more monomeric units repeat con- tinuously in a linear fashion to form a network. In yet another embodiment, the one or more monomeric units\n\n[0088] The hydrophobic material may be liquid and include, for example, oils or fats.
