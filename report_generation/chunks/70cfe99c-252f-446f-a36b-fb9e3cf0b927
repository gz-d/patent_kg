The loop antenna can take a different form. The planar dipole antenna, the loop antenna, and the feed network can be formed with (but not limited to) conductive materials in the form of, e.g., strips, patches, etc., directly or indirectly connected with each other. The loop antenna need not include spaced-apart opposite ends. The loop antenna need not be a single-loop antenna. The loop antenna can be a loop antenna of different form, shape, and size, with a complete closed loop or the form of a near complete loop. The ground plane can be formed integrally with the loop antenna or the ground plane may be spaced apart from the loop antenna. The feed network can be a differential feed network instead of a balun network. The differential feed network can be arranged on the same side as the balun network. The differential feed network may include two input portions each arranged to receive a respective input signal (the two input signals being out of phase). The number, size, and position of vias can be varied, so long as they operably connect the planar dipole antenna, the loop antenna, and the feed network. The planar complementary antenna is particularly adapted for (but not\n\n[0071] FIG. 9 shows an alternative embodiment of the bottom layer 903 of the antenna. The main difference between this embodiment and the embodiment of FIG. 1C is that the ground plane is now spaced apart from the loop antenna.", "type": "Document"}}
