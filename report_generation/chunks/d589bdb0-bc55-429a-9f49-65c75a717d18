The treated structure has improved surface rough- ness, and can be used as electrodes, filters, absorbers, catalysts, and sensors in various applications.\n\n[0012] In one aspect of the present invention, the metallic material is formed by a noble metal or an alloy thereof.\n\n[0013] In one aspect of the present invention, the alloy further includes a second metallic material and the second metallic material is selected from Cu, Co, Fe, or Ni.", "type": "Document"}}
