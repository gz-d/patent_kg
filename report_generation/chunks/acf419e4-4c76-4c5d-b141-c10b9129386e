In one aspect, a computer model, such as a CAD drawing, is made for each lens based on the number of dielectric projections, the projection heights, inter-projec- tion spacing, etc. The CAD drawing is converted to 3D printer instructions using any commercially-available soft- ware program for CAD drawing conversion. Using the printer instructions, a 3D printer is used to deposit the lens base and the dielectric projections by building up individual layers until the final projection height is reached. Any commercially-available additive manufacturing platform may be used to fabricate DDL 1 and DDL 2.\n\n[0033] The upper lens 2 is parallel to the physical aperture of the lower lens 1 and its schematic side cross-sectional view is depicted in FIG. 3(6). DDL 2 has a focal length of 20 mm and a diameter of 15 mm for the selected wavelength of 300 GHz. To concentrate the incident waves into the focal point, DDL 2 should firstly compensate for the incident progressive phase distribution from the lower lens 1 and provide a quadratic phase distribution above the lens 2 aperture. Hence, the desired aperture phase distribution of lens 2 is the sum of progressive phase distribution and quadratic phase distribution. Further details showing the operation of the lenses is set forth in the Examples below.\n\n[0034] A multi-focus synthesis method that compensates the required transmission phases at multi-focus points can be used to reduce the aberration as the focus steers away from the center. The height-variable dielectric post 101 is also used as the building block of the upper lens 2. The height distribution of the dielectric posts for the DDL 2 is shown in FIG. 4(6).", "type": "Document"}}
