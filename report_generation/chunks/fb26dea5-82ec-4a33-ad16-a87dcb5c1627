Because only half the plastic hinge length con- tributes to the rotation relative to mid-span, the summation of the above three displacements, which are taken over the whole plastic hinge length, is divided by two in the equation. With an ideal elasto-plastic model as shown in FIG. 10(5), both the external load on the beam and the internal compres- sion force at the compression zone keeps constant at the plastic deformation stage. The elastic deformation compo- nents, 9, and 6,, and hence the clastic rotation\n\nFrom FIG. 9 of the measured deformation curve of mechanism in Example 3, the plastic deformation 4, is found be about 20 mm at the mid-span displacement of 82 corresponds to the ductility factor of 2.75.

This value of 3, is reasonably close the test result of about 20 mm. Total elongation of the GFRP bars inside the plastic hinge zone at the corresponding displace- ment is about 3 mm as shown in FIG. 8.
