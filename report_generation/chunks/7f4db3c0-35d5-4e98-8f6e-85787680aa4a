For example, given a target color in RGB (or HSV) showing on a color rendering apparatus, current color systems do not support blend existing CMYK colors closing to the target color.\n\n[0087] In a CMYK system, each of C(Cyan), M(Mag- eton), Y(Yellow), K(Gray) has 100 levels expressed [0%,1%,2%, . . . , 99%] and is coded as (c, m, y, k).\n\n[0088] In a HSV system, H(hue) has 360 degrees expressed as [0\u00b0,1\u00b0, . . . , 360\u00b0], both S(saturation) and V(value) have 100 levels expressed as[0%,1%, ... 100%].\n\n[0094] Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inven- tors devise that these deficiencies may be owing to the lack a universal frame to bridge different color systems such RGB, CMYK, and HSV.\n\n[0089] In one example embodiment, a color conversion between RGB and CMYK may be represented as:\n\n[0095] Thus, it may be preferable to provide a universal frame having a common color space. Each color in RGB, CMYK, and HSV may be mapped into a unique color in this common space via a unique function. More preferably, under such a universal frame, the colors of various systems can be encoded, exchanged, mixed uniquely and precisely.\n\n1=255(1-c/100)(1-#/100),\n\ng=255(1-m/100)(1-K/100),\n\nb=255(1-y/100}(1-#/100}.\n\nExpression (1):\n\n[0090] In an alternative example embodiment, a color conversion between RGB and HSV may be represented as:", "type": "Document"}}
