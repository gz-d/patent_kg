Afterwards, another distinction emerges in the lattice evolution curves. For the pristine material, while the a-axis decreases steadily, the c-axis passes through a maxi- mum value (14.45 A) at around 4.2 V, and then drops steeply to 14.23 A at the end of charge. This collapse of the interlayer distance could be identified as the H2-H3 phase transition, which is the key factor that induces fast perfor- mance degradation of layered cathode materials upon cycling. For the inventive PGE-NCM811, the occurrence of this transition is delayed to 4.3 V, which reduces the con- traction of c-axis from 4.9% to 3.8% (22.4% reduction). For both of the materials, this H2-H3 phase transition is almost reversible, resulting in repeated lattice strains.\n\n[0054] Thus, the apparent weakening of the c-axis con- traction, can significantly reduce the stress and thus the cracks at the macroscopic electrode level after long-term cycles (FIG. 13a-d). Further, the reduced contraction of c-axis also enlarges the lithium diffusion channels, which facilitates the rate capability of PGE-NCM811.\n\nGrain Functional Mechanisms of the Monoclinic Boundaries of PGE-NCM811\n\nIn order to investigate the relationships between the\n\n[0055]", "type": "Document"}}
