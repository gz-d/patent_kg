FIG. 40 shows the two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude envelopes in this example, which are arranged to generate high- directivity beams with the same amplitude and 180\u00b0 phase difference at the broadside direction (8,=0\u00b0), mapping to the digital information \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d, respectively. To this end, the two equivalent sinusoidal amplitude enyelopes share an identical spatial period A yet with a space shift Ax=A/2. The phase difference between the two radiating cases as a function of the observation direction 9 is presented in FIG. 41 based on equation (12). It can be seen that a desired 180\u00b0 phase difference is generated at the main beam direction (broadside in this example) while deviating significantly for off-broadside directions. To directly generate BPSK modu- lated waveform, the animate STC matrixes (STC film) are applied to the universal metasurface antenna 400 according to the desired transmitted \u201c0/1\u201d digital stream (FIG. 42). FIG. 43 further shows the theoretical radiation power pattern of the universal metasurface antenna (also see related deri- vation under \u201cWave Manipulations with Frequency Shift- ing\u201d) and the calculated error vector magnitude (EVM) at different observation directions in a noiseless environment. can be seen that eavesdroppers receive a much weaker power at off-main-beam directions. Also, unlike the target user (receiver), off-angle eavesdroppers would sense incor- rect phase variation (information) in the main beam direc- tion, leading to corrupted constellations. It is envisaged that the inherent direction modulation property of the universal metasurface antenna 400 can be applied to other higher-\n\nIt\n\norder modulation formats, such as 8PSK and QAM, as well.", "type": "Document"}}
