The information handling system 200 may further include one or more disk drives 212 which may encompass solid state drives, hard disk drives, optical drives, flash drives, and/or magnetic tape drives. A suitable operating system may be installed in the information handling system 200, e.g., on the disk drive 212 or in the memory unit 204. The memory unit 204 and the disk drive 212 may be operated by the processor 202. The information handling system 200 also preferably includes a communication device 210 for establishing one or more communication links (not shown) with one or more other computing devices such as servers, personal computers, terminals, tablets, phones, or other wireless or handheld computing devices. The communication device 210 may be a modem, a Network Interface Card (NIC), an integrated network interface, a radio frequency transceiver, an optical port, an infrared port, a USB connection, or other wired or wireless communication interfaces. The communication links may be wired or wireless for communicating com- mands, instructions, information and/or data. Preferably, the processor 202, the memory unit 204, and optionally the input devices 206, the output devices 208, the communica- tion device 210 and the disk drives 212 are connected with each other through a bus, a Peripheral Component Intercon- nect (PCI) such as PCI Express, a Universal Serial Bus (USB), an optical bus, or other like bus structure. In one embodiment, some of these components may be connected. through a network such as the Internet or a cloud computing network. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that the information handling system 200 shown in FIG. 18 is merely exemplary and different information handling systems 200 with different configurations may be applicable to imple-", "type": "Document"}}
