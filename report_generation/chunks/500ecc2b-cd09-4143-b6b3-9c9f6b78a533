The structural design and magnetic actua- tion modes for the electromagnetic devices produce enhanced magnetic flux density and gradient, thereby facili- tating driving of actuation subject. According to some embodiments, a magnetic flux density of around 225 mT and. a magnetic field gradient of 15 T/m in a workspace of 100 mum are achieved. According to some embodiments, a mag- netic flux density of around 75 mT and a magnetic field gradient of 4 T/m in a workspace of 160 mm are achieved. This renders in vivo actuation of microrobots feasible and efficient.\n\n[0038] One or more embodiments include an electromag- netic device designed in such a way that magnetic core can be linearly moving relative to the elongated sleeve. This allows to modify the workspace, such as size, location, etc. of the workspace. For example, the size of the workspace can be 160 mm, 220 mm, or larger. This renders it suitable for applications where larger or adjustable workspace is required.\n\n[0039] For example, an electromagnetic device includes a moveable magnetic core or robotic core that has a core tip at an end facing the workspace. The magnetic field gradient is inversely proportional to distance. Therefore, magnetic field strength and gradient decrease sharply when an actua- tion subject (such as a microrobot) is located far away from the magnetic core. In this regard, the movable magnetic core ensures the distance between the actuation subject and the core tip can be as close as possible to maximize the manipulation performance. The tradeoff between the mag- netic gradient strength and the size of the workspace can be adjusted so as to be suitable for different application sce- narios.", "type": "Document"}}
