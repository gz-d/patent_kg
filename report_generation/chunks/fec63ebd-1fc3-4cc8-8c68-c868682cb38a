Preferably the look\n\n25\n\nup table is referred to iteratively.\n\nquick and efficient method of encoding blocks using an\n\nPreferably step (d) comprises the step of iteratively com\n\nencoding scheme that is capable of utilizing a plurality of\n\ndifferent possible encoding modes and selecting the best\n\nparing each coefficient f* of the transformed residual block\n\nto boundary points of quantization Sub-Zones stored in the\n\nmode for the job.\n\nAccordingly, one aspect of the present invention proposes\n\nlook up table. A quantization Sub-Zone contains all the values\n\n30\n\nof f* between its upper and lower boundary points. The\n\nthat the distortion is calculated in transform domain space, for\n\noperator Q maps all the values of f* within the sub-zone to a\n\nexample on the basis of a difference between the source and\n\nparticular quantization point having a quantized value Z,\n\nreconstructed blocks in frequency space. It is further advan\n\ncorresponding to that sub-zone. The operator Q\" maps the\n\ntageous if the quantization of the transformed block in fre\n\nquantized value Z, to an inverse quantized value i.
