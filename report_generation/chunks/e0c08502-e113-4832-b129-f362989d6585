Prediction module 910 predicts a predicted block P based on the source block S using inter or intra prediction according to one of a plurality of possible block encoding modes. Residual block defining module 920 computes a residual block D by subtracting the predicted block P from the source block S. The residual block computed by the module 920 is then output to an integer image transform module 930 which performs an integer image transform (e.g. an ICT) on the residual block D in order to obtain a transformed residual block F*. A quantizating and inverse quantizing module 940 iteratively refers to a look up table in order to perform pre-scaled quantizing of the coeffi- cients of the transformed residual block F* which produces a plurality of quantized coefficients z,,. The module 940 also inverse quantizes the coefficients z,, to obtain inverse quan- tized coefficients f,,*. The coefficients zz are output to an entropy encoding module 950 which entropy encodes the coefficients. Meanwhile a difference computing module 960 computes a weighted sum of squared differences (SSD) between f,,* and f,,*, using the coefficients f,,* of the block F* computed by module 930 and the coefficients f,* computed by module 940. A rate-distortion calculating module then calculates the rate distortion on the basis of the sum of squared differences output by modules 960 and the number of bits which module 950 required to entropy encode the coef-\n\nIn step 680 the sum of squared differences (SSD) between f,* and {,,* is computed.
