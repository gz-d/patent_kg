Therefore, the original view instead of the origi- nal synthesized video is preferred for temporal dictionary learning. For the original texture video in MVD system that has similar temporal properties with the conventional single- view video, the conventional videos from HEVC test sequences were selected as training sequences so as to separate the training sequences from the test sequences. To cover different spatial resolution and content, eight 2D video sequences were selected in the temporal dictionary learning. These videos are entitled \u201cBasketballDrive\u201d, \u201cFourPeople\u201d, \u201cFlowervase\u201d, \u201cJohnny\u201d, \u201cKristenAndSara\u201d, \u201cParkScene\u201d, \u201cRaceHorses\u201d, and \u201cVidyo3\u201d. The properties of the training sequences are shown in FIG. 13. The first 300 or 240 frames of each sequence were kept in training. For each sequence, four temporal layers were extracted at a uniform sampling way along the frame height. Then 32 different temporal layers in total were extracted. Temporal layer images with pixel intensity are directly employed as the feature maps in dictionary learning. These images were then divided into patches with size 8x8 and one-pixel overlap, which were collected as the training dataset for temporal dictionary\n\n[0118] In this embodiment, f=(*)=x, c, d, w,, wa are set as 1, 0, 0.5, 0.5, respectively, which denotes the flicker distor- tion and spatiotemporal activity distortion are summated in the pooling stage. The impacts of the pooling method, weight parameters and mapping function f(.) are discussed in Section III subsection D.\n\nIll. Experimental Results and Analyses", "type": "Document"}}
