The module receives basic physical information, biological test data, radiology test data, and textual reports of the stroke patients as input, processes these data through a deep learning network, then generates and outputs the medication and treatment recommendations that enable the patient to\n\n[0009] The\n\nobtain the best prognostic effect.\n\n10\n\n[0010] The LVO patient classification module is an end-to-end LVO screening tool based on a deep learning model. The module receives radiological examination data and clinical data of one or more of the stroke patients identified by ischemic strokes as input, processes the radiological examination data and clinical data through a deep learning network, generates and outputs a probability of each of the stroke patients being a LVO\n\n15\n\npatient.\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings:\n\n20\n\n[0011] The scope of the present invention is not limited to the content of the accompanying drawings provided.
