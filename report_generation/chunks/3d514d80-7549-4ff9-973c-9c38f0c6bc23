The plan view of the microplate 101 is shown in FIG. 2a. Each well 103 has a top diameter and depth of 15.6 mmx10 mm (diameterxheight). Therefore the top of the well 103 has an area of about 191.1 mm? (1.911 cm*). When water is provided into the wells 103 and frozen, ice forms in the well 103. The area of the top surface of the ice is defined by the size of the mouth of the well 103. In other words, the walls of each well 103 confine or limit the flow of any fluid placed onto the top surface of the ice within the well 103.\n\n[0031] FIG. 26 shows how the microplate 101 is used to make an ice-template for producing pure nanodrug (PND) particles. \u201cIce-template\u201d is used loosely in this description to described ice that is suitable for use in producing nanopar- ticles of a drug. At first, each of the wells 103 in the microplate 101 is filled with de-ionised water, at 201, and flash-frozen at minus 20 degrees Celsius to produce ice in the wells 103. The flash frozen ice provides the ice-template.\n\n[0032] Typically, the microplate 101 is can be placed in a freezer at minus 20 degrees Celsius for 10 hours to flash freeze the deionised water. More preferably, however, the base of the microplate 101 can be immersed into a liquid nitrogen bath, at 203, to flash freeze the de-ionised water before transferring the microplate 101 into a freezer at minus 20 degrees Celsius for 10 hours to prepare the ice for infusion with the hydrophobic solution. As the skilled man knows, liquid nitrogen has a temperature of minus 196 degrees Celsius, making the freezing even quicker than in the freezer of minus 20 degrees Celsius.", "type": "Document"}}
