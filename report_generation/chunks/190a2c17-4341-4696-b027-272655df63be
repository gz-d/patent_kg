A first aspect is concerned with the building\n\nfunction of droplet salt concentrations . The measured maxi\n\nblock of modern electronics , field effect transistor , consist\n\nmum voltage up to ~ 170 V appears when the ion concen\n\ning of four major components , i.e. , the gate , source , drain\n\ntration is increased to 10-3 mol / L , beyond which the output\n\nand substrate , respectively , which can dynamically gate the\n\nvoltage decays , probably due to the inability to form the\n\ntransport of carriers between the source and the drain when\n\nEDL again at such high concentration .\n\nan external voltage is applied in gate . Please see FIG . 1a .\n\n[ 0058 ]\n\nFIG . 16 is a graph showing output voltages gen\n\nFIG . 1b shows the schematic drawing of our transistor - like\n\nerated from TIDE - G made of PP ( left portion of graph ) and\n\nelectricity generator , termed as TIDE - G , in which the source\n\nPDMS ( right portion of graph ) . Under similar surface\n\nis made of a transparent ITO and the drain consists of an Al\n\ncharges , the TIDE - G devices made of PDMS and PP exhibit\n\nelectrode .\n\ncomparable initial output to that of TIDE - G made of PTFE .\n\n[ 0064 ] A second aspect is concerned with behavior of\n\nHowever , distinct from the latter , the output in both devices\n\ncontinuous droplet impinging serving as a facile method to\n\nmade of PP and PDMS exhibits a rapid decay , partly due to\n\ninduce high charge density on PTFE .
