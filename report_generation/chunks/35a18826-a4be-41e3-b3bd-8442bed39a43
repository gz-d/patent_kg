The dependent variables were the accuracy and the response time of users perceiving the thermal patterns. All the patterns were repeated thrice and presented in a randomized order, resulting in 7 pairs of spots with 2 directions of temperature change at 3 repetitions=42 trials for each participant. There was a 7-second gap between two consecutive cues. Each participant went through the similar procedure of training and testing as the ones in Study 2 and 3.\n\n[0122] Results: Accuracy & Response Time\n\n[0123] Accuracy. The repeated-measured ANOVA (RM- ANOVA) shows that the accuracy of thermal pattern iden- tification was significantly affected by the pair of spots involved in the pattern (F(6,66)=7.75, p<0.0005, n2=0.413), but not the direction of temperature change. The post-hoc pair-wise comparison reveals that the patterns involving the front spots around both ears were perceived significantly more accurately than the others (p<0.05). The patterns with the back spots and the bottom spots of both ears yielded significantly lower accuracy than the others (p<0.05).\n\n[0124] Considering the patterns that involve the spots around the same ear, the repeated-measured ANOVA was performed with the side of ear, the pair of spots, and the direction of temperature change as the independent vari- ables. The results show that the perception accuracy was not significantly affected by any of these factors.
