On the other hand, hard XAS of Ni K-edge, (FIG. 46) which has a micron-scale probing ability, shows no difference between these two materials. Thus, combining the soft and hard XAS results, the addition of KMnO, enables a higher oxidization state of Ni ions enriching in the outer layer of the primary grains, but has no effect on the internal electronic states deep into the bulk.\n\n[0045]\n\nFor\n\na\n\ndirect visualization of the Ni** gradient,\n\nSTEM-EELS was conducted for PGE-NCM811 and the line-scanning profiles were recorded along the indicated direction in the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image (FIG. 4c). FIG. 4d shows the EELS spectra along the scanning pathway recorded every 12 A, where two groups of peaks (L3- and L,-edge) emerged as the electrons from Ni 2p3,. and 2p,,. states, split by the spin-orbit interaction, transmit to the unoccupied 3d orbitals that are hybridized with 2p states of O. As expected, a double-peak character, which could be assigned to Ni** and Ni**, respectively, is observed for the peaks of L,-edge. Remarkably, the Ni** intensities gradually increase along the scanning pathway from the inner to the outer layer, while the L-edges of Mn and Co also exhibited slight changes (FIG. 7). The EELS result provides certain evidence that the primary grains of the PGE material of the present invention are covered with Ni**-rich surfaces. These Ni** ions were incorporated into the framework from the nanosheet precursor, which enabled a large proportion of interfacial atoms to be oxidized. The outermost depth of 20 nm surely makes a significant differ- ence at the primary-grain scale, which may induce the local octahedral distortion and thereby enhance the performance\n\nof PGE-NCM811 material.\n\nLocal Octahedral Distortion of Monoclinic Phase in PGE-NCM811\n\nedge-\n\nThe R-3m structure of NCM811\n\n[0046]", "type": "Document"}}
