In addition, it is contemplated that applications of various aspects of the dis- closed subject matter can be altered, modified, or otherwise redesigned, for instance, by choosing variations in wave- lengths for communications (e.g., transmission and reception of communications signals). In other exemplary modifica- tions, variations in coatings or overlays can be chosen, for example, in a desire to maximize reflection of incident radia- tion of interest (e.g., wireless communications carrier signal), transmission of solar radiation to maximize solar generation both, intermediate desired result.\n\ncell to the communications antenna to employ at least a portion of an electrical potential generated by the at least one solar cell in the operation of the communications antenna.\n\n9.
