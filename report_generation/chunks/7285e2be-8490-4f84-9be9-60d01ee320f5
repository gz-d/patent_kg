In some embodiments, the strap S includes a Velcro tape. The wearer can adjust the position/shape of the strap S to optimize the wearable space WS according to his/her requirement. In some embodiments, the ring body 112 is shaped so as to equip on the index finger of the wearer.\n\nThe receiving electrode layer 114 (i.e., antenna structure) may be disposed (or sandwiched) in between the top and the intermediate insulating layers 112a, 112h. The receiving electrode layer 114 may be disposed on a top surface of the intermediate insulating layer 1126. The receiving electrode layer 114 includes a plurality of receiving electrode portions RP separated from each other, and each of the receiving electrode portions RP may serve as a channel of the antenna structure. In some embodiments, the number of the receiving electrode portions RP is, for example without limitation, 5. The receiving electrode portions RP are arranged in a matrix and along a curve path on the top surface of the middle portion MP2 of the intermediate insulating layer 112. The receiving electrode portions RP of the receiving electrode layer 114 are equally spaced along a circumferential direc- tion.", "type": "Document"}}
