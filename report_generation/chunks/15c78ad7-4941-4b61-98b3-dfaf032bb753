As best shown in FIG. 1B, the groove 106 includes a first portion at the middle and second and third portions at two ends. At the first portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a distance d; at the second and third portions, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a distance smaller than distance d. Theoreti- cally, the distance d between the conductor strips portions 108 at the first portion should be equal to a half wavelength (ie., a half-wavelength distance). However, in practice, when the finite thickness of the conductor strips portions 108 are considered, the distance d may be slightly larger than a half wavelength. The reduced distance between the conduc- tor strips portions 108 in the second and third portions enables the formation of four ridges 114 sized L,xW, for suppressing side lobes of the antenna 100 when the antenna\n\n[0046] Agilent network analyzers E5071C and E8361A were used to measure the S-parameters of dielectric reso- nator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2. Satimo StarLab system and Near- field System Incorporation (NSI) measurement system were used for measuring the radiation pattern, antenna gain, and antenna efficiency of the dielectric resonator antenna and Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 200 of FIG. 2.\n\n[0047] In this example, in the microwave band, the dielec- resonator antenna resonates in its TE, ,,* mode.", "type": "Document"}}
