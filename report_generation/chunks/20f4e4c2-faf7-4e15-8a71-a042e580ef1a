From the corresponding reflection coefficients 1002 of FIG. 10, it can be seen that the measured 1008 and simulated 1006 antenna bandwidths (IS, ,l<-10 dB) are approximately 38% and 42%, respectively. In addition, from FIG. 10, two resonant modes are observed. The first resonance is caused by the TMo mode of the exemplary single-element 102 SPA, which can be verified by examining its electric field distribu- tion. Its measured 1008 and simulated 1006 frequencies (min. IS, ,) are given by 2.12 GHz and 2.09 GHz (1.43% error), respectively.\n\nFIGS. 7-8 depict yet another exemplary implementation of aGA 700, comprising a non-limiting parabolic reflector 702 antenna and one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704 according to further aspects as described herein, where FIG. 7 depicts a non-limiting parabolic reflector 702 antenna fed. by an exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna), and FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary non-limiting conformal overlaid solar cell structure 800 (of detail 708) comprising a coating or overlay 802 that can facilitate transmission of light while reflecting one or more of Radio Frequency (RF), microwave, or millimeter-wave signals to exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna).", "type": "Document"}}
