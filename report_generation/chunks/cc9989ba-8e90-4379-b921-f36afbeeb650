Transition from these two loading stages should be as smooth as possible, and mechanisms such as plastic buck- ling instead of elastic buckling can be utilized. In a plastic buckling of bar 17, the compression strength ofbar 17 reduces gradually but the compressive strength in the ductile material 30 picks up so that the total compressive strength can be maintained to a nearly constant value.\n\nwould be important for members with both tension and compression yielding. A plastic hinge model that features all these factors is yet to be found.\n\nFor compression yielding beams, the ductility of the over- all beam is directly related to the ductility of the compression yielding zone. This relation can be derived mathematically.

Referring to FIGS. la, lc & d, the addition of top and bottom reinforcement bars 18a and 185 and stirrups 19 surrounding the ductile block 60, separation between the concrete 15 and the ductile material 30 can be avoided.\n\n(2)", "type": "Document"}}
