A hydrophobic material is encapsulated in the one or more monomeric units. The term \u201cencapsulate\u201d means a material or compound is surrounded or partially surrounded by another material, ic. the monomeric units herein. The encapsulated hydrophobic material may react with the one or More monomeric units and form non-covalent bond, i.e. being stably carried by the monomeric units.\n\nmonomeric unit to essential oil of 1 to 1 (UP,-C,), initial weight ratio of monomeric unit to essential oil of 1 to 2 (UP,-C,), and initial weight ratio of monomeric unit to essential oil of 1 to 5 (UP,-C,). The mechanical properties of the composition with varied amounts of essential oil were analysed using mechanical tensile-stress tests. The inventors conducted dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and deter- mined that the composition had an elastic modulus range of 50 MPa to 500 MPa at 25\u00b0 C. In a particular embodiment, the composition has an elastic modulus of at least 50 MPa at 25\u00b0 C. and of less than 5 MPa at 100\u00b0 C. In a preferred embodiment, the composition has an elastic modulus of 50-150 MPa at 25\u00b0 C. and of less than 3 MPa at 100\u00b0 C. In a most preferred embodiment, the composition has an elastic\n\n[0104] In an embodiment, the hydrophobic material is a liquid. For example, the hydrophobic material is a hydro- phobic liquid comprising volatile aromatic compounds. The volatile aromatic compounds can be released to the sur- rounding upon application of the composition.", "type": "Document"}}
