In practice, the area of the battery pack or the back cover of a portable electronic product can be used for the energy-receiving coil. This vertical flux approach makes it easier than the horizontal flux approach to design a slim energy-receiving module. Electro-magnetic shielding 6 is provided on the side of the charging surface opposite from the side on which a device to be charged is placed. This shielding prevents flux from being directed in the wrong direction (which would be a safety issue\u2014especially if the battery charging platform was placed a metal surface) and enhances the magnetic flux that is available for battery charging. Electromagnetic shielding is also added on the side of the energy-receiving coil opposite from the side to be placed on the charging surface as shown for example in FIG. 2(8). In such a battery charging platform a secondary winding is provided that is associated with a battery to be charged. The secondary winding picks up the magnetic flux and generates a charging voltage that is pro- vided to the battery. Generally the secondary winding would be formed integrally with the battery such that a battery or a device containing the battery is placed on the charging sur- face with the secondary coil parallel to the surface such that it receives a maximum amount of magnetic flux. Alternatively, however, the secondary winding may be electrically con- nected to the battery but physically", "type": "Document"}}
