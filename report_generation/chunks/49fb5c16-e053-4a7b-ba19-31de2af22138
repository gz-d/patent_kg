The above-described deficiencies in solar energy collec- tion and use in communications systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conven- tional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding ben- efits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the fol- lowing description.\n\nRecently, use of planar mirrors as solar reflectors has been investigated. For instance, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the United States has estimated that the reflec- tor-type power plant would be able to produce electricity at a relatively low cost of 5.49 cents per kiloWatt-hour by year 2020, which could make solar power one of the cheapest renewable energy sources in the future. Thus, while solar power is a primary source for renewable energy, typically, solar power generation systems are separated from end use locations. As such, use of solar power still suffers from inef- ficiencies associated with transport losses.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe following presents a simplified summary of the speci- fication to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate any scope particular to any embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some con- cepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.", "type": "Document"}}
