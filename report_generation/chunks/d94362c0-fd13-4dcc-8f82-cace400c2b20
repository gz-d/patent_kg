The invention also relates to a related photoacoustic imaging/sensing apparatus.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Photoacoustic imaging is a biomedical imaging modality based on the use of laser-generated ultrasound, and it is considered as one of the most promising imaging techniques to have emerged in recent years. In general, photoacoustic imaging is based on absorption of laser light by specific tissue chromophores to excite ultrasound waves. These ultrasonic waves are encoded with optical properties of the tissue. By recording these waves over the tissue surface, a 3D absorption based image can be reconstructed.\n\n[0003] Apart from obtaining anatomical images, photoa- coustic imaging can also be applied to perform functional imaging, such as in functional optical-resolution photoa- coustic microscopy (OR-PAM), to determine functional properties of the tissues. One properties of particular interest is flow speed of body liquid such as blood. Existing methods to measure blood flow speed are based on various approaches, including photoacoustic Doppler (PAD), pho- toacoustic correlation spectroscopy (PACS), and thermal diffusion flowmetry (TDF). While each of these methods has their own advantages, they all require tens to hundreds of photoacoustic measurements to calculate the flow speed, which is time-consuming and computationally inefficient.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIn accordance with\n\nfirst\n\nof the invention,", "type": "Document"}}
