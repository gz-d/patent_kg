FIG. 4A demonstrates that the electronic fabric in single-electrode pattern includes two sections: MXene/CNTs electrospraying side as electrode layer, the electronic fabric and human as negative triboelectric and positive layers, respectively. When the skin (or other coun- terparts) is in contact with the electronic fabric, the skin will transfer the charges to the electronic fabric due to the high surface electron affinity of the electronic fabric. Once the separation occurs, the potential difference is generated. Hence, the electronic fabric continuously produces an alter- nate electricity (AC) signal through the entire cycle of contact and separation processes. FIG. 4B presents the simulated electric potential distribution by COMSOL mul- tiphysics, explaining the electricity generation process of during the contact and separation process of triboelectrifi- cation quantitatively. With the maximum degree of contact and separation, the simulation output of single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG) reaches the maximum\n\nvalue of about 200 V.
