The maximum mmf\n\nis labeled\n\nregion by a symbol \u2018P\u2019 (which stands for Peak mmf). The minimum mmf region at the junction of 2 patterns is labeled as \u201cV\u2019 (which stands for Valley of the mmf distribution). In order to generate a uniform munf distribution over the planar energy transfer surface, two more layers of winding arrays should be added, This principle is explained firstly by adding a second layer of winding array to the first one as shown in Fig.20. The second layer is placed on the first one in such a way that the peak mmf positions (P) of the patterns of one layer are placed directly over the valley positions (V) of the pattems in the other layer. Fig.21 highlights the peak positions of the patterns that are directly over\n\nthe valley positions of the other layer for the two overlapped layers in Fig.20.\n\nIt can be observed from Fig.21, however, that the use of two layers of winding arrays, while presenting an improvement over a single layer, does not offer the optimal solution for generating uniform mmf over the inductive energy transfer surface. For each hexagonal pattern in the two-layer\n\n10\n\n20\n\n13\n\nstructure, the peak positions occupy the central position and three (out of six) vertices of each hexagon. The remaining three vertices are valley positions (V) that need to be filled by a third layer of winding arrays. These valley positions are shown in Fig.22 as empty squares.", "type": "Document"}}
