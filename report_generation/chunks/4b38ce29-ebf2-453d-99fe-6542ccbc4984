This figure shows that TAF15 specifically binds to XIST RNA. The non-redundant readings of the two chains are displayed separately. The RefSeq gene also indicates chain information in different colors: red, forward strand; blue, reverse strand.\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\n[0050] FIG. 2c shows a histogram showing the number of TAF15 binding peaks on the XIST transcript compared to the expected peak number (meanzSD) based on 10,000 random shufile peak positions. The peak sites are directly extracted from the article by Kapeli et al. The p-value is based on the one-tailed Poisson test.\n\n[0051] FIG. 2d shows TAF15 antibody is used in HEK293T cells with IgG as a control, and formaldehyde- assisted RIP is used to verify the XIST-TAF15 interaction. Quantitative enrichment is performed using RT-gPCR in three different regions of XIST and two different regions of MALAT1. GAPDH served as an internal control. Data is expressed as mean+SD, n=3; ** indicates p<0.01 using the unpaired Student\u2019s t test. The upper right figure shows the results of TAF15 antibody and IgG immunoprecipitation experiments.\n\n[0052]\n\nFIG. 2e shows HTR-SELEX is used to verify the", "type": "Document"}}
