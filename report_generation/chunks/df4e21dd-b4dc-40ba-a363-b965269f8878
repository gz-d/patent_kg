Data series of amount of differential pixels is analyzed by com- prising power spectral analysis in which data series of differential pixels is decomposed by discrete Fourier trans- form. A discrete Fourier transform algorithm (Ferguson. 1979) is used. A power spectrum is obtained by autocorre- lation of the Fourier series and is plotted against the fre- quency values (FIG. 4). A total power value of the spectrum is calculated. The highest peak with lowest frequency value (max) is defined as the basic frequency component of the input signal. The frequency value is equivalent to the heart rate. The ratio of highest peak value to the total power value serves as the cardiac rhythmicity index. The principle of the calculation is that when the input signals with frequencies varying around the basic frequency component, the peak of basic frequency component in its power spectrum will be lower with frequency components around it higher. Thus, the ratio of basic frequency component power to total power\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention describes a method of using teleost to screen agents with any cardiotoxic effect, particu- alteration in heart rate and in heart beat rhythm.\n\nThe teleost can be an embryo or larvae of any fish belonging to the subclass Teleostomi, preferably, for example zebrafish and medaka because they offer advan- tages of external fertilization and transparency over other animal model used in cardiotoxicity assays.", "type": "Document"}}
