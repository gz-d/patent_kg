The respective control signals of the plurality of available control signals can be associated with corresponding display modes and/or corre- sponding barrier pattern mode (and/or corresponding barrier pattern) associated with the barrier component. The barrier control component can identify and select the control signal from the plurality of available control signals, based at least in part on the identity (e.g., data value) of the signal detected in the control region in relation to the visual image.\n\ncan be monitored. The barrier control component can include a sensor component that can monitor the control region of the projector screen component to facilitate detecting signals (e.g., optical signals or patterns) presented in the control region in relation to presentation of the 2-D video image(s) on the projector screen component. The 2-D video image(s) can include a signal region, wherein a signal can be embedded in the 2-D video image(s) and can correspond to the type of video content (e.g., normal 2-D content, enhanced 2-D con- tent that can be used to generate 3-D stereoscopic or autoste- reoscopic content) contained in the 2-D video image(s) to facilitate switching the barrier component to a barrier pattern", "type": "Document"}}
