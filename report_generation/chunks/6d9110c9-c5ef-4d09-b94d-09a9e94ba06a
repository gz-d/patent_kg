FIG. 11b illustrates the pin connections of this\n\ncomponent comprising a capacitor C 118 (shown in FIG. 10\n\nknown analog IC circuit. FIG.11c is a schematic diagram of\n\nsaid known Voltage regulator IC circuit minus the compensa\n\nwith its equivalent circuit resistancer). The capacitor 118 is\n\npositioned at an output of the Voltage regulator 110 in series\n\ntorcircuit. FIG.11d is also a schematic circuit diagram of said\n\n60\n\nwith a voltage source 124 of the compensator circuit 122. The\n\nknown IC circuit, but illustrating the nodes required for con\n\ncapacitor 118 is arranged in parallel with a load impedance\n\nnecting a compensator circuit according to the invention to\n\nZ, 120 of the voltage regulator. Together with an inductor\n\nsaid IC circuit. FIG. 11e shows the compensator circuit with\n\n119, the capacitor 118 forms an LC filter circuit at the output\n\nthe required nodes for connecting to the circuit of FIG. 11d to\n\nforman output compensated regulator circuit according to the\n\nof the voltage regulator 110.
