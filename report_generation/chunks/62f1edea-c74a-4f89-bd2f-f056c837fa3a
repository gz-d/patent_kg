This process is called \u2018entropy encoding\u2019. For example, after quantization, many of the coefficients may have a value of zero; a type of entropy encoding called run-length coding, takes account of consecutive zero coefficients and encodes the length of each such \u2018run\u2019, rather than encoding each zero value separately. Other types of entropy encoding which take advantage of the statistical properties of the data, for example variable length encoding (VLC) or arithmetic coding, may also be used. The above describes simple encoding methods in which each block in each frame is encoded independently of the other frames. This method of encoding is still used, however most modern compression algorithms allow a variety of different lock encoding modes, any of which may be used to encode\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus for calculating the sum of squared differences between an origi- nal block and a reconstructed block of image or video data and/or a method and apparatus for determining the distortion caused by encoding a block of image or video data. The present invention also proposes an apparatus and method for encoding image or video data, in which an appropriate encod- ing mode is selected from a plurality of possible encoding modes. The method and apparatus may be used for encoding a H.264/AVC video signal, but the present invention is not limited to that format and may be used to encode other for- of video and data well.\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
