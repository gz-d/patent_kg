In this respect, the universal metasurface antenna 400 includes multiple space-time-coding (STC) meta-atom arranged to facilitate (i) temporal modulation for producing nonlinear effects and (ii) simultaneous space-time modula- tions for converting newly generated waves into free space to mitigate the PMC (FIG. 4A). Specifically, the periodic switching of the radiation states of the meta-atoms may provide an infinite number of harmonic frequencies fo+mfAz where m is an integer.
