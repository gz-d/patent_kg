Moreover, for each experiment, the amount of the transferred charges in TENG is measured to be identical with the charge carried by the departing droplet (see FIG. 8d), confirming that the electricity gen- eration from the TENG indeed originates from the tribo- electric effect, an interfacial phenomenon by nature. Note that by continuous droplet impinging or ion-injection method, the amount of negative charges on PTFE surface can be enhanced, which can then induce positive charges on TO. However, these positive charges could not be released from ITO due to the attraction by these negative charges on PTFE, and there is no pronounced electricity generation, which is in striking contrast to the case of TIDE-G. All these results convincingly highlight the unique advantage of TIDE-G, which is characterized with a bulk effect and hence enhanced\n\ndg) _ lerAM-aO] 20 evn = 2 Aepe io) Bet RW T= ony Ch Cal\n\ngt=0)=8 (2)\n\nwhere q(t) is the transfer charges, R, and R,, are the impedances of the external load and water droplet, respec- tively.
