Referring to FIG. 6B, treatment of JEG-3 cells with ber- bamine, isotetrandrine, fangchinoline, and E6 berbamine all significantly inhibited JEV or ZIKV infection as shown by DsRNA immunostaining followed by high-content image\n\nTsotetrandrine\n\nof\n\nNO,\n\nthat\n\nof 1M.\n\nthat\n\nof uM.\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0060002 A1\n\n10\n\nanalysis .

Briefly ,\n\nA549 cells plated in triplicates in 96 - well plates\n\nere\n\npretreated with different doses of berbamine ( 5 uM , 15 uM\n\nor 30 uM ) , fangchinoline ( 10 UM , 20 UM or 30 uM ) or\n\nN\n\nOH\n\nisotetrandrine ( 10 uM , 20 uM or 40 uM ) for 1 h before\n\ninfected with about 10 MOI of Dengue virus type 2 ( DENV\n\n2 ) . Cells were then fixed at 24 h.p.i. and subjected to DsRNA\n\n# 5\n\nimmunostaining to detect DENV - 2 replication .\n\n[ 0090 ] As shown in FIGS . 7A and 7B , all berbamine ,\n\nisotetrandrine , and fangchinoline can significantly inhibit\n\nDENV - 2 infection in A549 cells in a dose dependent manner .\n\nBr\n\nTaken together , these data demonstrate that berbamine and\n\nits analogues are potent anti - DENV agents and may be used\n\nas pan - anti - flavivirus agents .\n\nIdentification of Compounds with a Similar\n\nStructure by Virtual Screening\n\n[ 0091 ] The inventors identified further 13 compounds via\n\n# 6\n\nligand - based virtual drug screening by using berbamine as\n\nreference .
