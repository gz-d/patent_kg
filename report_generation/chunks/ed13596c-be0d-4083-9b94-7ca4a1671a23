For example, when the PV panel is inspected by a UAV, the artificial light may be provided by an optical transmitter installed in the UAV as a trigger signal for triggering the transmission of sensed parameter data to the UAV.\n\nThe operation mechanism of the state machine 524 is illustrated in FIG. 7. As illustrated, the operation of the state\n\nof\n\nUS 11,671,731 B2\n\n5\n\n6\n\nmachine 524 may use the direction of electrical current flowing through the PV device as an event A and the change in voltage across the PV device as event B for transition between states. The state machine 524 may be configured to, based on real-world scenario, when the device is instructed externally to start the transmitting, then transmits the infor- mation and returns back to stand-by state.\n\ndevice to provide a wireless communication channel for communicating with a UAV 1200 inspecting the PV system. The UAV may include an optical transmitter for emitting visible light as a trigger signal for triggering the PV devices to emit NIR light for transmission of sensed parameter data to the UAV. The UAV may further include a NIR camera for receiving the emitted NIR light emitted by the PV devices.\n\nDefinition of states and events of the state machine 524 are as follows:\n\nState 1: data recording\u2014the parameter sensing signal V_Xsen is received and a corresponding sensing data is recorded in memory; the PV device is operated in generative mode and the direction of electrical current is positive, causing the current sensing signal V_Isen to have a high- level value;\n\nEvent A\u2014the PV device enters diagnostics mode operation and the direction of electrical current is negative, causing the current sensing signal V_Isen to have a low- level value;\n\nState 2: standby\u2014waiting for trigger signal;", "type": "Document"}}
