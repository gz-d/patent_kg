More specifically, the present in- vention is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force or a similar correction force and maintaining such correction force constant or substan- tially constant until spinal deformities are corrected. The present invention can correct various spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis, and the rotation around the longitudinal axis of the spine. Additionally or alternatively, the present invention can provide horizontal plane correction of spinal deformities. [0016] The present invention provides a device for cor- recting spinal deformities, as indicated in claim 1 which\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nfollows. The correction device is capable of providing a constant and controllable correction force, which can be applied to the deformed spine portion. Such a correction force can be maintained at a constant level until the spinal deformities are corrected. For example, the correction device can be formed by using the pseudoelastic or su- perelastic properties of a material, such as a NiTi alloy, to provide a constant and controllable correction force. The correction device is capable of completely correcting the spine at the time of operation or gradually correcting the spine both during and after the operation. Additionally or alternatively, the correction device can apply a con- stant correction force subsequent to the surgery, allowing a gradual correction of the spinal deformities.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS", "type": "Document"}}
