The method of claim 1, wherein the first metallic material is formed by a noble metal or an alloy thereof.\n\n11. The method of claim 10, wherein the alloy further includes a second metallic material and the second metallic material is selected from Cu, Co, Fe, or Ni.\n\n12. The method of claim 1, wherein an electrochemical cell is used for depositing the nano-structured metallic layer onto the surface of the metallic structure in step (b); the electrochemical cell comprises a first electrode, a second. electrode, and an electrolyte in electrical connection, the metallic structure to be treated being connected as the first electrode.\n\n[0099] Spectroscopy and Plasmoelectronics\n\n[0100] Embodiments of the present invention can also be used to provide nanostructured silver-based materi- als that are stable and show vitally important physical and chemical properties. Ag-based materials with metal nanotexture at surface obtained by the present inven- tion show great potential in a wide range of other applications in spectroscopy and plasmoelectronics, etc.\n\n13. The method of claim 12, wherein the solution of electrolyte includes an acid.\n\n14. The method of claim 13, wherein the acid includes one of nitric acid and citric acid.\n\n[0101] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.\n\n15. The method of claim 13, wherein the solution of electrolyte further includes an additive for manipulating of the nanoparticles.\n\n16. The method of claim 15, wherein the additive includes least one of acid, metal salts, water soluble polymer, citrate sodium, polystyrene sulfonate, sodium dodecyl sul- (SDS), and cysteine.", "type": "Document"}}
