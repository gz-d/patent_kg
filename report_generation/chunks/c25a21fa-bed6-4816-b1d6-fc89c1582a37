In par- ticular: FIG. 19(a) shows idealized waveforms of input AC mains voltage and current (with a phase shift (6) between V, and 1,); FIG. 19(4) shows idealized waveforms of input volt- age V, and current I, of the diode rectifier (with V, and I, in phase); FIG. 19(c) shows idealized waveforms of output volt- age V, and current I, of the valley-fill circuit (with V, a rectified version of V,); and FIG. 19(@) shows idealized waveforms of voltage across LED load (V,), output load. current (I,,) and the output load power (P,,).\n\nIt should also be noted that it may be desirable to provide diode-capacitor clamp that can be added to each LED string to provide a current path for the inductor current in case some of LED devices fail. An example of such a possibility is shown in FIG. 16.\n\nAn analysis of this circuit can start from the load side considering the equivalent circuit as shown in FIG. 20 where inductor winding resistance is shown as R and the total LED load voltage drop Vo is considered to be constant.\n\nFrom FIG. 20, the average output current L can be expressed as:", "type": "Document"}}
