As discussed above, when the vapor flows into the implantation chamber a glow discharge is created under the influence of the high negative potential applied to the sample holder 6 this creating a plasma and beginning the implanta- tion process. However, to maintain a steady-state glow dis- charge the pressure in the implantation chamber must exceed the breakdown pressure. An analysis of the conditions for establishing the breakdown pressure shows that the determin- ing factors are the pressure in the evaporation chamber 17,", "type": "Document"}}
