The diode rectifier may be either a standard diode rectifier or a voltage doubler.\n\nleads to high switching loss in the primary inverter cir- cuit, high AC resistance in the PCB copper tracks and more importantly high electromagnetic interference (EMI) emission.\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention the diode rectifier and the capacitor are formed as part of the battery charging circuit.\n\nProblem (1) can be solved by using a planar inductive charging platform based on a multilayer planar winding array structure, which allows the charged electronic equipment to be placed anywhere on the charging sur- face as described in WO03/105308. The present inven- tion addresses problem (2) and provides a simple and more effective secondary device to enable energy trans- fer between the primary planar charging platform and the secondary module more effectively at a much lower operating frequency (eg as low as 100 kHz).\n\nPreferably there may be provided a secondary energy receiving element comprising a second coil formed as a spiral in a plane parallel to the soft magnetic sheet and wherein the second coil is connected in parallel with the first coil. This second coil may be formed on a printed circuit board which may be fixed to said soft magnetic sheet.\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention the energy receiv- ing element may comprise a coil formed on a printed circuit board.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
