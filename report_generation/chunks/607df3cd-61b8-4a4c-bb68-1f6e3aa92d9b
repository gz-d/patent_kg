Each group could be further divided into two groups: hot and cold, according to the direction of tempera- ture change. To facilitate the data analysis, the thermal pattern was coded based on the locations of the individual stimuli and the direction of temperature change. For example, the pattern 1h2h indicates the pattern that the front and the top modules on the left side are triggered with the hot stimuli, while 5h6h indicates the similar pattern but on the right side. The pattern 1cSc indicates that the front modules on both left and fight sides are triggered with the cold stimuli,\n\n[0087] Study 2: Multi-Point Thermal Patterns With One Ear\n\n[0088] With the multi-spot auricular thermal patterns in FIG. 9a and 6, Study 2 was conducted to determine how accurately and fast the users could recognize these spatial thermal patterns that only involve the spots around the same ear.\n\n[0089] Participants\n\n[0090] 12 participants (3 female and 9 male, average age 25 years old) were selected from a local university where none of the participants had previous experience with ther- mal haptics. The average auricular skin temperature was 32.3\u00b0 C. (SD=1.8). The room temperature was controlled at 24\u00b0 C.\n\n[0091] Apparatus\n\n[0092] Based on the design of the auricular thermal icons, four-Peltier ThermoEarHook device was used for the study, and used the same temperature control mechanism and hardware as those used in Study 1.\n\nthe\n\n[0093] Study Design", "type": "Document"}}
