By way of example, magnetic field gradient at the center of the workspace may be adjusted by linearly changing the distance between the magnetic cores of one or more of the electromagnetic devices and the center of the workspace. For example, the distance can be changed by linearly moving the magnetic cores under the driving force of an electric motor, such as a servo motor.\n\n[0091] In some embodiments, a first group of electromag- netic devices is energized using a first energizing current value in a first direction (such as clockwise), and a second. group of electromagnetic devices is energized using the first energizing current value in a second direction (such as counterclockwise) opposite to the first direction. An opti- mized magnetic field gradient at the center of the workspace is obtained by adjusting geometric parameters for the one or more pairs of electromagnetic devices, such as by adjusting geometric parameters for each magnetic core.\n\n[0092] A direction of energizing current refers to direction of current flow in an electric coil when looking at the electric coil from a predetermined perspective by a person. In the present description, to decide the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of energizing current, the person is stand- ing at one end of the magnetic core distal to the workspace in such a way that his or her eyes are looking at the center of workspace.", "type": "Document"}}
