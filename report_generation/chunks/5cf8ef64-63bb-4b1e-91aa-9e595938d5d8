FIG. 5G shows the optical and infrared sweating pictures of the electronic fabric before and after running exercise. When the electronic fabric is lifted up, it is observed that the skin beneath it is still dry. And the infrared picture demonstrates that the surface tem-\n\nUS 2024/0260899 Al\n\nperature of the electronic fabric is decreased about 1.8\u00b0 C. after running because of the transferred moisture from the bottom hydrophobic layer, assuring the user\u2019s comfort and fast drying of inner layer, and signal stability. However, there is a lot of perspiration at the contact area between the commercial gel electrode and the skin, and it even fell off from the skin. The fabricated electronic fabric shows great application prospect in wearable electronic textiles with comfortable exercise experience.\n\n[0105]\n\nIn\n\nsummary,\n\nthe present invention provides", "type": "Document"}}
