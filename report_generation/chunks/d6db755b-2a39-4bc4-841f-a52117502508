For example the principal and auxiliary primary windings may be formed either as conductive coils or may be formed as conductive tracks on a printed circuit board (PCB). The principal and auxiliary windings may preferably be formed in the same plane (for example if they are formed on the same PCB), or may be formed in parallel but slightly spaced apart planes. In addition, while the windings are shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B in a rectangular form this is not essential and the windings may take other shapes such as circular windings.\n\n4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 wherein said first second planar windings are located in the same plane.\n\n5.

Generally this may be in the center of the platform, but depending on the design of the principal winding if the sag occurs elsewhere then the auxiliary winding should be located correspondingly. Generally one auxiliary winding may be sufficient to compensate for the voltage sag but if not, for example if the charging surface is particularly large, then two or more auxiliary windings may be employed.", "type": "Document"}}
