For example, in RGB color representation, the basic colors are red, green and blue whereas in CYMK, the basic colors are cyan, yellow and magenta.\n\n[0114] Preferably, each of the plurality of numerical codes is arranged to represent a unique color in a color space. Effectively, for a color i, all these functions have the same integer value, described as I(a,, B,, o,)=q(r,, g,. b,)=f(c,, m,, y;, k,=t(h, s, V,); this is the universality feature of the color coding system.\n\n[0100] Based on prime-number-theory, U-Color creates an integer space where each color has a unique integer number. Preferably, U-Color may uses primes 2, 3, and 5 to represent cyan, magenta and yellow respectively. In addition, their products, i.e. 6, 15, 10, and 30 may represent blue, red, green, and gray. Alternatively, other prime numbers may be used instead. In this disclosure, the prime numbers are denoted as p, representing i basic colors or color compo- nents.\n\n[0115] In addition, two different color i and j have different corresponding values, je.
