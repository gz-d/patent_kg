This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed sub- ject matter nor delineate the scope of the subject innovations. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\n\nThe disclosed subject matter relates to systems, methods, and devices that can produce or comprise a single-phase and multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) AC-DC synchronous rectifier, which includes self-driven control circuitry, for use in high- voltage power applications are presented. In an aspect, the synchronous rectifier circuitry can behave like, function as, or emulate a diode bridge (e.g., a bridge rectifier), and also can provide benefits over conventional rectifiers, wherein, for example, one benefit can be a significantly smaller conduc- tion loss as compared to a conventional diode bridge.\n\nmains frequency also has been developed and reported in U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,425. It is based on the detection of the phase- phase voltage, output voltage and timing circuits. Sophisti- cated logic and timing circuits are needed to provide the gating signals if the AC source has significant source induc- tance. However, the gating signals for synchronous rectifiers based on phase-phase and output voltages detection is not adequate because the diodes of a traditional bridge rectifier only turn off naturally after their current reverse-recovery processes. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,425, the three-phase syn- chronous rectifier circuit replaces the six diodes with power MOSFETs and uses \u201cvoltage-controlled gate drive circuits\u201d and the appropriate logic circuits to control the switching of", "type": "Document"}}
