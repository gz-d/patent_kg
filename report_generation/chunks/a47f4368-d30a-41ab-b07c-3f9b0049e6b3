Considering that dimensions of a microfluidic channel are largely dependent on sizes of the target particles, the diameters of whole cells and nuclei are measured for both the NP460 and NPC43 cells. For mea- surement of whole cells, the cells are resuspended by typsinization and their diameters are quantified under a bright-field microscope. The diameters measured are 13.842SD 1.99 um (N=90) for NP460 cells and 14.18+SD\n\n2.54 hm (N=103) for NPC43 cells.\n\n[0089] On the other hand, the fluorescence staining of Hoechst 33342 is applied to visualize the nuclei in whole cells and the chemically extracted nuclei (See description about \u201cnuclear extraction\u201d below in the \u201csupplementary information\u201d section for further details). Notably, it can be observed that the resuspended cells and nuclei are typically in a spherical shape. The diameters of these nuclei are measured for both cell types, results of which are explained in further detail below with respect to FIG. 4B.\n\n[0090]\n\nFIG. 4B illustrates a bar graph showing diameters", "type": "Document"}}
