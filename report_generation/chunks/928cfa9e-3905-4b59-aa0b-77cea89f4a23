White nodes indicate proteins recognized only in a group of gRNAs. The pink nodes represent the proteins recognized in two groups of gRNA. The red nodes show the proteins recognized in all three groups of gRNA. A line is connected between two proteins evaluated as interaction (STRING interaction score20.40). The width of the line is proportional to the STRING inter- action score. The nodes with purple edges highlight the proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. XIST-related proteins are highlighted in bold orange (19 proteins). The blue font represents SNF2L, and TAF15, which are two newly identified XIST-related proteins.\n\n[0046] FIG. le shows the top five important gene ontology (GO) semantics of XIST-related proteins.\n\n[0047] FIGS. 2a to 2h show the analysis results that verify the proteins associated with XIST, wherein:\n\n[0048]\n\nFIG. 2a shows the verification of the XIST-TAF15\n\ninteraction using WB and immunoFISH. The upper panel shows that Western blotting is performed using anti-human TAF15 antibody after CARPID. From the lysate of HEK293T cells co-transfected with BASU-dCasRx and each of pre-gRNA (control), and the gRNAs specifically targeting locus 1 (XIST-L1), locus 2 (XIST-L2) and locus 3 (XIST-L3), the biotinylated protein is precipitated using streptavidin affinity-coupled magnetic beads. The experi- ment is carried out in three biological replicates and showed. representative results. The lower panel shows the immun- oFISH test results of TAF15 and XIST. HEK293T cells are fixed and incubated with anti-TAF15 antibody and corre- sponding secondary antibody with CF 488A (green). A specific oligonucleotide probe labeled as Cy3 (red) is used to detect XIST. The nucleus is counterstained with DAPI (blue). The box area in the left image is enlarged and displayed on the right. The scale is shown. This image is\n\nrepresentative of three independent biological experiments.", "type": "Document"}}
