The one or more monomeric units encapsulates a hydrophobic material.\n\n[0081] nis an integer indicating the number of methylene bridges, i.e. \u2014CH,\u2014 groups, and is preferably selected from 1 to 5, more preferably selected from 1, 2, 3 or 4, further preferred from 2, 3 or 4 and in particular embodi- ments of the present invention, n is 3. For example, if n is 1, there is one methylene bridge present at the respective position.\n\n[0087] The term \u201chydrophobic material\u201d as used herein relates to a material that repels water. Hydrophobic materials are generally non-polar. The hydrophobicity of a material may be determined by measuring water immiscibility and water solubility. Hydrophobic materials are generally water immiscible and insoluble in water. The hydrophobicity of a material, particularly solid materials, may also be deter- mined by measuring water contact angles, i.e. wherein a liquid-vapour interface meets a solid surface. If a water contact angle on the solid surface is larger than 90 degrees, the solid surface is considered hydrophobic.", "type": "Document"}}
