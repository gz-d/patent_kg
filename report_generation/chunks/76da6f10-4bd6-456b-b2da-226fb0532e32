For example, the Harrington system, introduced in the early 1950s, employs a distrac- tion rod on the concave side of the deformed spine. The use of the Harrington system and spinal fusion in treating idiopathic scoliosis was found useful for both single and double thoracic contours. However, a loss of lumbar lor- dosis, or the \"flatback\" effect, can occur when using the Harrington system along with distraction over the lumbar spine. This effect could be countered by segmental wiring (e.g., sublaminar wiring or wiring of the spinous process) over the instrumented site to retain the lumbar lordosis. Nevertheless, the Harrington system can have limited control of sagittal plane correction, limited derotation, and high rate of hook dislodgment in the lumbar spine, en- counter distraction rod fracture, and require postopera- tive external support. [0003] Armstrong and Connock, and Cotrel and Asso- ciates introduced the use of a compression rod on the convex side, which uses transverse traction with Har- rington rods to correct deformities. Luque and Jacobs introduced the use of strengthened upper hooks to pre- vent pull out and increase yield strength of the distraction rod. These configurations helped the Jacobs\u2019s system achieve correction in hyperextension. [0004] The Luque system employs a spinal implant for scoliosis correction. The use of the spinal implant in- volves both convex technique and concave technique. The convex technique is usually used to treat patients with thoracic curve, whereas the concave technique is used on patients with lumbar curve or severe deformity. The Luque system uses sublaminar wiring as multiple segmental fixation points with attachment to a rod and the L-shaped Luque rod. The sublaminar wiring provides fixation at various points along the instrumented area and allows the correction forces to distribute along the spine, thereby lowering the possibility of", "type": "Document"}}
