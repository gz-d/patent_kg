In this example, step 102 includes transmitting another laser pulse of different wave- length (compared to the other two laser pulses) to the sample, and step 104 includes receiving another photoacous- tic signal from the sample in response to transmission of the other laser pulse. Each of the time differences between transmissions of the two laser pulses may be in the order of micro-seconds, in the order of nano-seconds, ete. The two time differences may be identical. Steps 106 and 108 may include processing at least one of the two photoacoustic signals, and the other photoacoustic signal, based on a linear spectral unmixing model to determine oxygen saturation in the blood. The linear spectral unmixing model may also take into account errors in the photoacoustic signal (e.g., caused. by the Griineisen relaxation effect).\n\n[0067] In one implementation of the method 100, hemo- globin concentration, oxygen saturation, and blood flow can be determined with a single raster scan. Details of the determination of hemoglobin concentration, oxygen satura- tion, and blood flow are as follows.\n\n[0068] A. Hemoglobin Concentration Measurement\n\n[0069] In one embodiment, the hemoglobin concentration is determined based on a photoacoustic absorption model and oxygen saturation is determined based on a linear spectral unmixing method/model, illustrated Y.
