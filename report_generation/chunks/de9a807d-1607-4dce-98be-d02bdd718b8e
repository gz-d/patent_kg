In an aspect, the one or more solar cell(s) can be positioned proxi- mate to the reflective ground plane as described above regard- ing determination of H and 6 with respect to FIGS. 3-6, thus facilitating receipt of reflected solar radiation and conversion of a portion of the reflected solar radiation to an electrical potential. In a further aspect, the one or more solar cell(s) 1706 can be located proximate to and associated with the communications antenna 1702.\n\nIn addition, solar energy collection system 1800 can com- prise one or more selective transmission layer(s) 1806 (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) fabricated on, positioned on, or otherwise located adjacent to the one or more solar cell(s) 1804. For instance, according to an aspect, solar energy col- lection system 1800 can comprise a selective transmission layer positioned ona side of the one or more solar cell(s) 1804 (e.g., one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.) opposite the non-planar reflector structure (e.g., reflector 702). In a further aspect, selective transmission layer 1806 (e.g., a coating or overlay 802, etc.) can be adapted or con- figured to transmit a portion of incident solar radiation (e.g., such incident light 322 (522), etc. with regard to FIGS. 3-6) to the one or more solar cell(s) 1804. In yet another aspect, the selective transmission layer can be further adapted or config- ured to reflect a portion of communications signals (e.g., one or more of incident Radio Frequency (RF) signals, incident microwave signals, or incident millimeter-wave signals) to reflected communications", "type": "Document"}}
