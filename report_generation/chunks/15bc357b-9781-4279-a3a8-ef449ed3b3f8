The voltage across the capacitor is written as do,/e,, where Op, \u20acp and d are the charge density, dielectric constant and thickness of PTFE, respectively. Two additional capacitors also established at the water/PTFE interface and the water/drain interface, respectively, thus forming a closed-circuit. Please see Figs. 14a to 14d. Since the capacitance of the capacitor Cp three orders of magnitude smaller than of the two capacitors at water/PTFE and water/drain interface, almost all these positive charges stored on the bottom plate of Cp can be transferred other two capacitors in the switching-on mode. Also, upon the end of the charging process, the can be recharged by the other two capacitors. Thus, the reversible and efficient charge transfer between ITO and drain provides a pathway for the conversion of the hydrodynamic energy stored the configurable, gate-like droplet. Indeed, as discussed In Fig. 3d, for the impinging droplet with larger We, more electricity generation is achieved as a result of the presence of larger spreading area for charge transfer. Notably, during the entire process, the virtual source (PTFE electret) preserves a constant charge density owing to its high charge stability, as confirmed by the reversible charge measurement discussed in Fig. 3c. Still, the nydrodynamic-to-electrical energy\n\nCp,\n\nare\n\nthe\n\nCp\n\nin\n\na\n\nIs\n\nto\n\nconversion can be Improved by the control of higher charge density of the PTFE electret.\n\nOur transistor-like design is also generic to water with different ion concentrations. demonstrate the generality of our generator, we then measured the electricity generation under\n\nTo\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\n14", "type": "Document"}}
