The main components of the controller 300 are processor 302 and memory 304. The processor 302 may include one or more: CPU(s), MCU(s), GPU(s), logic circuit(s), Raspberry Pi chip(s), digital signal processor(s) (DSP), application- specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC), field-programmable gate array(s) (FPGA), or any other digital or analog cir- cuitry/circuitries configured to interpret and/or to execute program instructions and/or to process signals and/or infor- mation and/or data. The memory 304 may include one or more volatile memory (such as RAM, DRAM, SRAM, etc.), one or more non-volatile memory (such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FRAM, MRAM, FLASH, SSD, NAND, NVDIMM, etc.), or any of their combinations. Appropriate computer instructions, commands, codes, infor- mation and/or data may be stored in the memory 304. Computer instructions for executing or facilitating executing the method embodiments of the invention may be stored in the memory 304. For example, control signals (e.g., space- time coding sequences, space-time-coding matrixes, space- time-coding films, etc.) for controlling the operation of the subwavelength units (e.g., their control elements) of the metasurface structure may be stored in the memory 304. In some embodiments, the processor 302 and memory (stor- age) 304 may be integrated (i.e., memory 304 embedded in the processor 302). In some embodiments, the processor 302 and memory (storage) 304 may be separated (and operably connected). The controller 300 may be operable to establish power and/or data communication with the metasurface structure, e.g., via one or more of: cable, bus, wire, electrical conductor arrangements, etc. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that the controller 300 shown in FIG. 3 is merely an example and that the controller 300 can have", "type": "Document"}}
