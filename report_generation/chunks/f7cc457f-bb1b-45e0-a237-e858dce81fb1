The method of claim 8 further comprising deforming a portion of the supporting member to conform to deformities.\n\n1. A method of providing a constant or substantially con- stant force for correcting spinal deformities in a human patient, the method comprising:\n\n10. The method of claim 8, wherein the predetermined amount of the correction force can be adjusted.\n\nproviding a correction device comprising an elongated rod, the elongated rod having a pre-contoured shape of a normal degree of kyphosis and lordosis of at least a portion of the patient\u2019s spine, the elongated rod com- prising a superelastic material having a transition tem- perature (Af) within the range of human body tempera- ture;\n\n11. The method of claim 8, wherein the correction force activated during the spine correction surgery.\n\n12. The method of claim 8 further comprising limiting supporting member from movement.\n\n13. The method of claim 8 further comprising limiting supporting member from a rotation movement.\n\n14. The method of claim 8 further comprising providing anchor member for mounting the supporting member to deformed spine portion.\n\ndeforming the elongated rod to conform to a deformed portion of the patient\u2019s spine;\n\nmounting the deformed elongated rod to the patient\u2019s spine including the deformed portion, whereby the deformed elongated rod is capable of applying a correction force having a predetermined amount to correct the deformed. portion of the patient\u2019s spine, the correction force being generated by the superelastic material at the patient\u2019s body temperature and in an austenite phase of the super- elastic material; and\n\n15.
