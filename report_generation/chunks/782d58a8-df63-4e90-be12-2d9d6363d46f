In this embodiment, the metasurface antenna 400 is operable at microwave frequen- cies and utilize positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes as the active element. In this embodiment, the metasurface antenna 400 includes an array of subwavelength meta-atoms on top of a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW). Each meta-atom includes two +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings to\n\nradiate\n\ntwo orthogonal eigen-polarization states ly)\n\n(+45\u00b0\n\nlinear polarization) and |v) (\u201445\u00b0 linear polarization) in free space. Each slot opening can be independently switched between the radiating (\u201c1\u201d) and non-radiating (\u201c0\u201d) states in real time by the PIN diode. In this embodiment, the radiating state of the meta-atom is temporally modulated with a time cycle T,=1/f, and the frequency of the injected monochro- matic wave is {,, subject to {,>>f,,. In this embodiment, independent time-coding sequences applied to all meta- atoms forms a two-dimensional (2D) \u201c0/1\u201d space-time- coding (STC) matrix, which is controlled by a field pro- grammable gate array (FPGA). Our STC metasurface antenna enables extracting and converting the in-plane guided wave (GW) into the out-of-plane propagating wave (PW) with arbitrary wave properties.", "type": "Document"}}
