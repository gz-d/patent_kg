This can be\n\nachieved through testing the circuit or system using known\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\ntechniques. Alternatively, identification may merely com\n\nprise a recognition that a particular component Such as a\n\nThe foregoing and further features of the present invention\n\nwill be apparent from the following description of preferred\n\ncapacitoris designed to exhibit capacitance and that said level\n\n35\n\nof capacitance is a designed feature of said component.

The\n\nFIG. 2 is a graphical depiction of the magnitude of the\n\nmethod also comprises determining a value of a series para\n\n40\n\nimpedance against operating frequency of the prior art\n\nsitic effect associated with said part of the electronic circuit or\n\ncapacitor of FIG. 1;\n\nsystem that exhibits capacitance. There are a wide range of\n\nmethods for measuring parasitic inductance and again one\n\nFIG. 3 is a circuit diagram showing a buck converter with\n\nprior art capacitors as the input and output capacitors;", "type": "Document"}}
