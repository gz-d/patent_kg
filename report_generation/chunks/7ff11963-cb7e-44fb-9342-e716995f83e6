In particular, it is elieved that the present designed NIR light-activatable platinum(IV) complexes may also serve as prodrugs to controllably release the clinical drugs for precise and directed treatment. Therefore, it is believed that platinum (IV) complexes are especially suited as NIR activatable rodrugs for the treatment and/or elimination of cancer cells and/or infection such as that caused by bacteria through the release of clinical drugs and/or photooxidation.\n\n[0092] Therefore it is understood that upon activation with NIR, photoexcitation causes the present platinum(IV) com- exes to transform into strong oxidants, which can subse- quently oxidize intracellular biomolecules, such as proteins and lipids, generate ROS, lipid peroxides, and protons. Upon exposure to NIR, it is believed that these platinum(IV) complexes may easily oxidize surrounding molecules and may be reduced to platinum(ID, releasing the two axial ligands. Most intracellular biomolecules, such as protein and lipids are easily oxidized; therefore, during this photo- reduction progress it is believed that the existing intracel- lular biomolecules can serve as the electron donors and be oxidized, leading to the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxides, and protons which may further inhibit and/or attack cancer, the infection, bacteria, etc.", "type": "Document"}}
