The concentration of ions in the salt solution may be of 0.1-3 M. In another example, the hydrogel electrolyte 106 may include an elec- trolytic solution containing at least one acid of H3PO,, H,CO;, CH;COOH or HF. The concentration of acids in the electrolytic solution may be of 0.1-3 M. A skilled person may recognize any other electrolytic solutions including suitable salts, ions or acids according to their needs.\n\n[0142] The active material 116 comprises a metal oxide or a metal oxide compound deposited on the substrate 110. In one example, the active material may be MnO, electrode- posited on the SS mesh. The MnO, may have a porous structure comprising a plurality of nanoflakes intercon- nected with each other. The nanoflakes may have a polycrys- talline structure comprising a plurality of nanograins with a size of, for example, approximately 10 nm. Similar to the nanocrystalline and porous structure formed by the elec- trodeposited zinc, the porous nanostructural architecture of the electrodeposited MnO, may reduce ion diffusion path which in turn facilitating electrolyte penetration as well as charge/ion transport.", "type": "Document"}}
