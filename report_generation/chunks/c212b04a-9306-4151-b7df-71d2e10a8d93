A solvent, e.g. an organic solvent such as DCM or trichloromethane (TCM; also known as chloroform) is used to dissolve the organic polymer (e.g., PCL). When the polymer is dissolved, the surface-treated biodegradable metallic materials (e.g., mag- nesium beads) are then added to the polymer solution. The mixture is then sonicated to let the metallic materials align or distribute evenly in the solution within the polymer substrate. After the process of sonication, the mixture is then dried. A heat treatment process is finally conducted to enhance the and adhesion between the\n\nThermal treatment process conditions \u2018Temperature 60\u00b0 C.-100\u00b0 C, Pressure 100 mBar Humidity 10%-20% \u2018Treatment Time 8-24 hrs\n\nExample 5: Coupling Agent Treatment\n\nA coupling agent treatment can be applied to the biode- gradable metallic materials directly or after a surface treat-\n\nTABLE 4\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n40\n\n50\n\n35\n\n60\n\n65\n\nment such\n\ndiscussed and exemplified in\n\nof Examples\n\nfront of it.\n\nbonding\n\nbiodegrad-\n\nUS 10,603,412 B2\n\n9\n\n10\n\nExample 8 : 150 um Magnesium Beads\n\nable metallic materials and the biodegradable polymer .
