An eye movement analysis with hidden Markov model (EMHMM) with co- clustering comprising:\n\na vector of prior values of hidden states, a transition matrix of the hidden states, and\n\na Gaussian emission for each hidden state; wherein the prior values indicate the probabilities of time-series data starting from a corresponding hidden state; the transition matrix indicates the transition probabilities between any two hidden states; and the Gaussian emissions indicate the probabilistic associations between an observed time-series data and a hidden state; and\n\na co-clustering data mining technique;\n\nwherein the EMHMM with co-clustering analyzes eye movement data involving stimuli with different feature layouts.\n\n2. An eye movement analysis with switching hidden Markov model (EMSHMM) comprising:\n\na vector of prior values of hidden states, a transition matrix of the hidden states, and\n\na Gaussian emission for each hidden state; wherein the prior values indicate the probabilities of time-series data starting from a corresponding hidden state; the transition matrix indicates the transition probabilities between any two hidden states; and the Gaussian emissions indicate the probabilistic associations between an observed time-series data and a hidden state; and\n\ntwo levels of hidden state sequences comprising: several low-level hidden state sequence models that are used to learn the eye movement pattern of several cognitive states and a high-level hidden state sequence model that acts like a switch that captures the transitions between cognitive states;\n\nwherein the EMSHMM analyzes eye movement data in complex tasks that state changes.\n\ncognitive\n\ninvolve\n\n3.
