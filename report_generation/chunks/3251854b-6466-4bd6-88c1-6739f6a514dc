Preferably, the presodiated anode is formed by way of a discharging process at about 40 mA g7? to about 60 mA gm for about 9 hours to about 11 hours. In an embodiment, the duration of the discharging process may be about 10 hours.\n\n[0018] Other features and aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.
