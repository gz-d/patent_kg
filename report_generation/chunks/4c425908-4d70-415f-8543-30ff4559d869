Thus,\n\nA practical implementation of the embodiment of a com- bined voltage source of FIG. 9 is shown in FIG. 10. In opera- tion, the current of the capacitor 110 is sensed by a sensing resistor Rs 410, which can be a non-inductive sensing resistor, a resistor fabricated on a printed circuit board, a hall-effect current transducer, for example. Its voltage will be amplified by a non-inverting amplifier 420 formed by the operational amplifier A,,R,, and R,.
