The control module comprises a memory, a state machine and a com- munication protocol logic. The state machine is configured for receiving a current sensing signal provided for indicating a direction of an electrical current flowing through the photovoltaic device for determining whether the photovol- taic device is operated in a generative mode or a diagnosis mode; receiving a voltage sensing signal provided for indi- cating a change in a voltage across the photovoltaic device in response to illumination by an artificial light when the photovoltaic device is operated in a diagnostics mode; and generating a transmission enabling signal based on the current sensing signal and the voltage sensing signal.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention generally relates to photovoltaic devices, more specifically, to an apparatus for facilitating photovoltaic device to provide a wireless communication channel.\n\na\n\n15\n\n20", "type": "Document"}}
