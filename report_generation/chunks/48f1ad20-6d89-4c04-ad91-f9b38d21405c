FIG. 25A shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatograms of com- plex 4 (10 1M), FIG. 25B shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatograms of complex 5 (10 uM), FIG. 25C shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatograms of complex 6 (10 1M), and FIG. 25D shows a RP-HPLC (254 nm) chromatograms of complex 7 (10 1M) in PBS buffer with the presence of 2 mM ascorbate. The solution is irradiated with 880 nm laser: or a continuous laser, (0.4 W/em?). \u2018peak corresponds to platinum(ID drug; *peak corresponds to ligand 3; and *peak corresponds to DMXAA.\n\n[0140] FIG. 26A shows the percentage of complex 4 (10 HMD remaining after irradiation and without irradiation. FIG. 26B shows the percentage of complex 5 (10 uM) remaining after irradiation and without irradiation. FIG. 26C shows the percentage of complex 6 (10 uM) remaining after irradiation and without irradiation. FIG. 26D shows the percentage of complex 7 (10 uM) remaining after irradiation and without irradiation. All tests in FIGS. 26A-26D were run in the PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mM sodium ascorbate in the dark or with 880 nm laser irradiation (0.4 W/cm\u2019).\n\nExample\n\n4\n\n[0141] Cytotoxicity Test:\n\n[0142] Human lung carcinoma A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC), and cisplatin-resistant A549cisR cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) are cul- tured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 100 pg/mL penicillin/ streptomycin. Human ovarian carcinoma A2780 and cispla- tin-resistant A2780cisR cells are cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, and 100 ug/mL penicillin\u2019 streptomycin. Human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells (Ameri- can Type Culture Collection, ATCC) are cultured in MEM with 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% L-Glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 100 pg/mL penicillin/streptomycin. For A2780cisR and A549cisR cells, 2 HM of cisplatin is added into the culture medium after the attachment to maintain the resistance. All the cells are cultured at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% COQ,.", "type": "Document"}}
