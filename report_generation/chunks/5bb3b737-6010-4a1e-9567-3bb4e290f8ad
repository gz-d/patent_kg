Owing to the large specific surface area (interfacial area per unit volume) of the membrane, the membrane-based reactor provides a_ high-performance absorption/desorption process in a small volume, which is beneficial to the energy storage performance enhancement. Furthermore, the microchannels having a high specific sur- face area can be integrated with the membrane to obtain a highly-compact and highly-efhicient energy storage reactor. In one embodiment, the membrane may have a pore diam- eter in a range from approximately 0.2 to 6 microns with a thickness in a range from approximately 20 to approxi- mately 175 microns; porosity ranges from approximately 0.4 to 0.85. The porous membrane 1s selected from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), their composites, and other materials.\n\nporous\n\n[0029] FIG. 2 depicts a thermochemical energy storage system 100 that includes the membrane-based thermochemi- cal reactor 10 of FIG. 1. As seen in FIG. 2, a solution tank 110 acts as a receptacle for the solution (refrigerant/absor- bent mixture) while a refrigerant tank 120 acts as a recep- tacle for the refrigerant. A solution pump 112 may be used to circulate the refrigerant/absorbent solution and a refrig- erant pump 122 may be used to circulate the refrigerant.", "type": "Document"}}
