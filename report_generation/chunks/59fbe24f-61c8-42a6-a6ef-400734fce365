In an embodiment herein, the ligand is a nitrogen-, oxygen-, and/or halogen-containing ligand, as it is believed that most current clinical platinum drugs contain these three kinds of ligands. It is believed that nitrogen, oxygen, halogen, sulfur, and phosphorous are excellent coordination atoms, they can easily form coordination bonds with platinum through unidentate, bidentate, or tridentate ligands.
