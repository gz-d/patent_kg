The spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) calculations were carried out based on the Perdew-Burke- Emzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional and the projector augmented wave (PAW) potential. An energy cut-off of 520 eV was used for expanding the Kohn-Sham wave functions, and a gamma-centered 8x8x8 k-point grid was implied for the Brillouin zoon integration. All the lattice parameters were employed from the experimental PDF refinements. To correct the self-interaction error (SIE), the U-value of Ni-3d electrons was set to 6.0 eV indicated from the reference.\n\n[0041] As seen in the XRD results of FIG. 1, the pristine NCMB811 precursor is mostly identified as B-Ni(OH), (JCPDS, No. 14-0117). However, after the addition of KMnO,, a distinct phase was revealed in the PGE-NCM811 XRD patterns, which accorded with a composite hydroxide (Ni(OH),(NiOOH),.167)o.857 With a small amount of Ni** (JCPDS, No. 89-7111). As the morphology of the primary precursors presented nanosheet morphology with large inter- faces, as seen in FIG. 2a-2e, such oxidation effect acts on the interfacial atoms of the precursors, and then enrich in the\n\nUS 2022/0115659 Al\n\ninterfaces after oriented attachments of the\n\nprimary-grain interfaces during calcining. Furthermore, as the NiO, layers in NiOOH, compared to those in Ni(OH),, are arranged randomly, some degree of local distortions may be intro- duced into the PGE-NCM811 structure.\n\nThe ex situ XRD of FIGS. 3a-36 and inductively\n\n[0042]", "type": "Document"}}
