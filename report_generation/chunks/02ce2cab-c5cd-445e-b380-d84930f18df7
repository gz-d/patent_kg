Prior to commencing the heating programs, the tubular body 110 is purged with an inert gas to completely replace air therein with the inert gas. Examples of the inert gas suitable for use in the present method include, but are not limited to, helium, nitrogen, argon, etc. Preferably, the tubular body 110 is purged with argon, in which the argon flows from upstream to down- stream of the tubular body 110, that is, from the first temperature zone 130a towards the second temperature zone 1305. According to embodiments of the present disclosure,\n\nUS 2022/0411965 Al\n\nthe tubular body 110 is purged with argon at a flow rate of 50-100 cm?/min, such as 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 cm*/min, more preferably, the tube furnace 100 is purged with argon at the flow rate of 80 cm*/min.", "type": "Document"}}
