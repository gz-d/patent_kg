These windings can be connected in series or in parallel or a combination both. The advantage of using an array of primary transformer windings is to generate a more uniform magnetic field than a single winding. This uniform magnetic field distribution is illustrated in a practical example of a 4x4 winding array as shown in Fig.5(a). When connected in series (of the same polarity) and excited with a high-frequency ac voltage, this 4x4 winding array generates magnetic field that is almost uniform as shown in Fig.5(b). Each winding generates its own magnetic field. When arranged in an array manner, the overall magnetic field is much more uniform than the field generated by a single winding. This can bc clearly seen by comparing the magnitude of and\n\nplots\n\nFig,1(b)\n\nFig.5(b).\n\nBesides using the series connection, the primary transformer windings can be connected in parallel or a combination of series and parallel. Fig.6(a) shows an example with an array of primary\n\n25\n\nof\n\na\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n7\n\nC\n\nthat the\n\nand D. This\n\nwindings forming four groups in four zones A,B,C means proposed more than one primary transformer winding connected in parallel to the power inverter of the primary induction circuit. If the secondary element is placed on Zones A and B, the equivalent circuit of the proposed system is shown in Fig.6(b), As the secondary element is close to the primary windings in Zones A and B (but not C and D), only the primary windings A and B sense the secondary load. Primary windings C and D have virtually no load and therefore their secondary circuits are essentially open circuits. This means that only the overlapped area between the induction surface and the secondary element has energy transfer. This localized activation principle an feature of this invention.\n\nhas\n\ninduction\n\nis\n\nimportant", "type": "Document"}}
