Furthermore, no appreciable deterioration in the ionic con- ductivity was observed after 30 d of long-term storage in air (FIG. 12A). The stable electrochemical performance of the AD-gel under the aforesaid conditions was also observed in the AC impedance spectra as shown in FIG, 12C. All these results confirm the extremely temperature tolerance and anti-dehydration function of AD-gel electrolyte for long- term application.\n\n[0226] The electrochemical performance of the fabricated AD-battery 1400 under normal condition (25\u00b0 C.) was investigated. As shown in FIG. 15A, the CV curves of Zn anode revealed that the plating/stripping of the deposited zinc is stable with nearly overlapped curves. For the depos- ited MnO, cathode, it is observed that two distinguishable redox peaks occur in the discharge/charge process and the CVs remained invariable after several cycles, demonstrating a good reversibility of the cathode.\n\n[0221] Preferably, a rechargeable Zn\u2014Mn0O, battery con- taining the aforesaid AD-gel may be fabricated in accor- dance with the fabrication method as discussed, by combin- ing electrodes with the fabricated AD-gel. Binder-free electrodes were prepared by an in-situ electrodeposition method, which can provide an intimate direct contact of Zn or MnO, with the current collectors such as stainless steel mesh (SS mesh).

The corresponding CV curves also revealed two pairs of reduc- tion/oxidation peaks, suggesting a two-step reaction (FIG. 15C).Furthermore, with the increasing scan rates from 1 to\n\nThe\n\nXPS\n\nresults\n\nrevealed\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\ntransport.\n\n[0225]", "type": "Document"}}
