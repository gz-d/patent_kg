At the same time, it is believed that these complexes will be reduced and release the photo-sensitive ligands and platinum. (ID drug. It is believed that the platinum(II) drug may serve as PDT agents to further enhance the therapeutic effect.\n\n[0094] In an embodiment herein the method of manufac- turing a platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(b) contains the steps of providing a platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(a), providing an NHS ester of 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (Le., ligand 3), and reacting the platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(a) with the NHS ester of 5,6-dimethylxanthe- none-4-acetic acid to form the platinum(IV) complex of\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\nFormula II(b). Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that this manufacturing method is efficient, easy, and scalable.\n\n[0095] In an embodiment herein a method for manufac- turing a platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(c) contains the steps of providing diammine (cyclobutane-1,1 dicarboxy- lato) dihydroxido platinum(IV), providing a NHS ester of 3-((4-(3-(7-(diethylamino)-2-oxochroman-3-yl)-3-oxoprop- 1-en-1-yl)phenyl)(methyl)amino)propanoic acid, and react- ing diammine (cyclobutane-1,1 dicarboxylato) dihydroxido platinum(IV) with the NHS ester of 3-((4-(3-(7-(diethyl- amino)-2-oxochroman-3-yl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl) (methyl)amino)propanoic acid to form the platinum(IV) complex of Formula II(c).
