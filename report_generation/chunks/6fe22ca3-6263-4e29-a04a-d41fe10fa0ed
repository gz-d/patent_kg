At this stage, an electrical energy storage device being encapsulated with polymeric layer is obtained.\n\nhydrogel matrix. The synthesized AD-gel electrolyte exhib- ited a transparent state (FIG. 5A). For the ease of visualization, a blue ink was doped into precursors of the AD-gel prior to performing polymerization (FIG. 5B).\n\n[0204] The characterization and performance of embodi- ments of the electrolyte and the electrical energy storage device containing said electrolyte will now be discussed. Structural and phase characterizations of the as-prepared electrodes were performed by XRD using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer with Cu Ko irradiation (A=1.54 A. The surface morphology of these samples was characterized by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, FEI/Philips XL30). The morphology and microstructure of the samples were revealed by a JEOL-2001F field-emission TEM.\n\n[0212] The freezing point of the AD-gel may be controlled by tuning the ethylene glycol (EG) weight contents as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B. In general, the freezing point of the AD-gel decreases (ie. becomes more negative) with an increase in the EG content. In particular, a freezing point of -20.8\u00b0 C. was obtained with the use of 30 wt % of EG (FIG. 6B).\n\n[0213] The results of thermodynamic test indicated that the elastomer (PDMS) coating can effectively prevent water evaporation over 120\u00b0 C., while the normal PAM-hydrogel lost its weight approaching to its original water contents under the same conditions (~80 wt %) (FIG. 7A). In addi- tion, DSC analysis indicated that the crystallization tmepera- ture of the AD-gel was about -23\u00b0 C., suggesting that the anti-freezing property of the AD-gel (FIG. 7B).", "type": "Document"}}
