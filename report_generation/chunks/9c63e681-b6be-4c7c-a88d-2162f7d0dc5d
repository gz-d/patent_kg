The oscillator arrangement 2502 is operable to gen- erate third harmonic power (e.g., in the form of electric current or voltage). The patch antenna arrangement 2504 is operably coupled with the oscillator arrangement 2502 for radiating terahertz electromagnetic radiation based on the third harmonic power generated by the oscillator arrange- ment 2502. The oscillator arrangement 2502 may include one or more oscillators, such as one or more transistor-based oscillators. The patch antenna arrangement 2504 may include one or more patch antennas. In some embodiments, the terahertz electromagnetic radiation radiated by the patch antenna arrangement 2504 may be in the range: from about 0.1 THz to about 10 THz, from about 0.2 THz to about 5 THz, from about 0.3 THz to about 3 THz, from about 0.3 THz to about 1 THz, from about 0.4 THz to about 0.8 THz, from about 0.4 THz to about 0.7 THz, from about 0.6 THz to about 0.7 THz, or from about 0.64 THz to about 0.69 THz, etc.\n\n[0103] FIG. 26 shows a radiator unit 2600 of a radiator terahertz electromagnetic radiation in some embodiments invention. The radiator unit 2600 can be considered as more specific implementation of the radiator unit 2500.\n\nthe", "type": "Document"}}
