In one example, a space translation Ax is introduced to the spatial amplitude envelope (FIG. 40). The aperture field distribution becomes A(x\u2014Ax)e~*\", and the associated far-field radiation pattern is\n\nFO) = 6 Mew 0 py (4)\n\nFrom equation (14), it can be seen that a space translation Ax of the amplitude envelope introduces an additional phase shift Ao(8)=-&,,,-G sin 8)Ax to the phase pattern without affecting the power pattern of the universal metasurface antenna. Moreover, the introduced phase shift AO is a function of the observation direction 8, meaning that differ- ent directions possess different phase shifts for a fixed space translation Ax of the amplitude envelope. In one particular example (as a special case), the phase shift in the main beam direction 6, is\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nQn Ad(G,) = \u4e00 qo\n\nconsidering the main beam direction is\n\n\u201c(= 4) 6, = siv \u603b\n\n[0190] used\n\nas\n\nFor illustration, the BPSK modulation scheme is example to show the directional information\n\nan", "type": "Document"}}
