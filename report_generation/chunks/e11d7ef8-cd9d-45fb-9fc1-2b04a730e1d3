The Isola spinal implant system was developed from Harrington\u2019s principles and designs and assembled with variable screw placement system (VSP). The assembly of this implant is intended to minimize internal or external profiling and increase stability and durability. However, complications associated with iliac screw breakage, transverse connector breakage and screw breakage at the end of constructs have occurred when using the Isola system.\n\nDEVICE FOR CORRECTING SPINAL DEFORMITIES\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/406,019 filed Aug. 25, 2002.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
