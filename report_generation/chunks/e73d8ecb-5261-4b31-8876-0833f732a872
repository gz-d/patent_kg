Typically the plasma may be generated by, for example, thermionic dis- charge, pulsed high-voltage glow discharge, radio frequency plasma sources, microwave plasma sources, cathodic arc metal plasma sources and sputtering targets amongst other possibilities. After the plasma has been generated, a negative potential is applied to the sample holder which negative potential serves to attract positive ions out of the plasma and to accelerate them towards the sample where they are implanted. A problem with conventional techniques, how- ever, is that there does not exist a single plasma source that is capable of generating a plasma containing ions of all possible elements. For example, it is very difficult to generate a plasma containing positive ions of solid materials with poor electrical conductivity such as sulfur, phosphorous and boron, and. poorly or semiconducting materials such as silicon, germa- nium and elements with low melting points and high vapor pressure. Unfortunately many of these materials that are dif- ficult to implant are materials where the ability to perform\n\nIn a preferred embodiment the method comprises forming electron focused electric field to enhance the ionization plasma, and where the electron focused electric field formed by the small exit opening and the large area sample holder.\n\nPreferably a negative potential is applied to said sample holder as a series of pulses and maintaining said exit opening grounded. The pressure in said implantation chamber is pref- erably maintained above a breakdown pressure.", "type": "Document"}}
