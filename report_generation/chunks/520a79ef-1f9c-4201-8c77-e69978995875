No. 13/113,837 discloses a wide-dynamic-range phase-sensitive SPR sensor based on the combination of spectral and phase investigation via a differential Michelson spectral interferometer. In this appli- cation, a dual-path Michelson interferometer is used to intro- duce sufficient optical path different (OPD) between the probe and reference paths so that spectral interferogram in terms of sinusoidal fringes can be captured to analyze the SPR phase change between the p- and s-polarized beams. While only the phase change in the p-polarized beam is associated with SPR, the phase change in the s-polarized beam is used as the baseline reference.\n\nFIG. 9 shows the simulation results of the phase response in SPR and LRSPR sensing surface configuration;\n\nFIG. 10 shows the simulation results of the phase response in the wide dynamic range spectral phase-sensitive SPR sen- sor with the SPR sensing surface configuration; and\n\nFIG. 11 shows the simulation results of the phase response the wide dynamic range spectral phase-sensitive SPR sen- with the LRSPR sensing surface configuration; and\n\nFIG. 12 is a flowchart of a method for detecting character- istics of a target sample according to an embodiment of application.", "type": "Document"}}
