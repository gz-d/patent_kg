The loss of the SR circuit can be expressed as:\n\nIn an aspect, the self-driven synchronous rectifier of sys- tem 200 is designed to manage resistive, capacitive, and/or inductive loads. Referring briefly to FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C (along with FIG. 2), illustrated diagrams of example (e.g., typical) driving waveforms associated with the low-side por- tion of the SDGD subsystem in relation to different types of loads associated with (e.g., connected to) the SDGD sub- system, in accordance with an aspect. In FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C, i,, is the input current having the same polarity ofv,,,. FIG. 6A depicts a diagram of an example driving waveform 600 associated with the low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem in relation to an associated resistive load, in accordance with an aspect. FIG. 6B depicts a diagram of an example driving waveform 610 associated with the low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem in relation to an associated capacitive load, in accordance with an aspect. FIG. 6C depicts a diagram of an example driving waveform 620 associated with the low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem in relation to an associated inductive load, in accordance with an aspect.\n\nPsP privert PAP ss (01", "type": "Document"}}
