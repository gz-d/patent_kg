In this example, a solution contain- ing a predetermined amount of oligo-RNA may be spin coated or dip coated on the gold-coated membrane modified. with MCH 206. The oligo-RNA 208 may react with the hydroxyl group of MCH by forming a covalent bond there- with. As such, the oligo-RNAs are immobilized on the membrane. After the immobilization process, the membrane may be washed with suitable solvents such as 1x PBS (pH 7.4) followed by distilled water to remove any unreacted oligo-RNA.\n\n[0065] Without being limited by the above example, it is appreciated that the substance selection structure 104 may be applied to capture other cancer biomarkers so as to detect different types of cancer. This may be done by simply replacing the receptors 208 with other aptamers that is specific to the antigen of the cancer of interest.\n\n[0072] Optionally or additionally, after the substance selection structure 104 is fabricated, the positive immobili- zation of the receptors 208 and their ability of detecting the target substance 112 may be determined by step 404. At this step, a solution of the target substance 112 that is specific to the receptors 208 may be added on the substance selection structure 104 and examined by reported techniques such as AFM. In this example, the oligo-RNA (i.e. the receptors) is specific to an antigen of gastric cancer CA72-4. A PBS solution of CA72-4 may be added on the membrane fol- lowed by being examined with AFM. As shown in FIG. 5B, a plurality of sharp peaks 504 may be observed as compared with the \u201cbare\u201d gold-coated PC membrane (FIG. 5A), indi- cating that there is a positive immobilization of the oligo- RNA and the detection of CA72-4.", "type": "Document"}}
