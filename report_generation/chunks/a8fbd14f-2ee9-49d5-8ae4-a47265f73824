The first conductive strip portion is generally elongated but need not be straight. Likewise, the second conductive strip portion is generally elongated but need not be straight. Preferably, the angle is about 90 degrees. Alternatively, the angle may be between 45 degrees and 135 degrees.\n\n[0008] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the feed network is arranged on a second side of the substrate, and the second side is opposite the first side.\n\n[0009] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the planar complementary antenna further includes one or more vias\n\n[0003]\n\nIn accordance with\n\nfirst\n\nof the invention,\n\nformed from a PCB substrate.\n\nfeed\n\nfirst\n\napart\n\nfirst\n\nside\n\nof\n\nfirst\n\nloop\n\nfeed\n\nential\n\nthe\n\nside.\n\nplane\n\nand\n\na loop-like antenna\n\nopposite\n\nclose to\n\nJan. 7 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0005980 A1\n\n2\n\nbut spaced apart .
