Passing radio frequency power through a transmis-\n\nsion antenna placed adjacent to the right hind limb of the animal delivers electrostimulation to the muscle. FIG. 5B shows images of the injury sites in both control and those with implants, where the three images at the upper panel are the injury on the right limbs with electrostimulation and the bottom three images are the injury on the left limbs without electrostimulation. From these images, the injury received electrostimulation and drug delivery therapy repair faster compared with the injury on the left hind limbs. The sutures also have mostly healed after 9 days. The microneedle patches are still on the two sides of the injury and adhere on the muscle firmly. There is only shallow injury observed on the right hind limbs after 9 days (top right), but the wound is also obvious on the left hind limbs (bottom right). Corresponding histological sections of muscle defect sites are shown in FIG. 5C, where there are obvious newly- regenerated myofibers in the implant group after 5 days, whereas the control group still shows an evident injury at the defect site. Compared with the implant group, there are abundant inflammatory cells in the control group. Addition- ally, myofibers are primarily centrally nucleated and begin to approximate the structure of the native uninjured muscle in the implant group after 9 days, indicating that the implant group shows better injury healing performance than the control group. The statistic injury depth shown in FIG. 5D shows the accelerated tissue repair process on the right limb on day 5 and day 9 samples in the implant group (p<0.05,\n\n0.01, respectively).
