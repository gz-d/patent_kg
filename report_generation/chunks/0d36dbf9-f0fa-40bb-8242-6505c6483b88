If there is not addi- tional circuitry (e.g., additional control circuit) to facilitate turning the comparators CP, and CP, to an off state at certain desired times (e.g., at or near a half cycle), the comparators CP, and/or CP, may not respond quickly enough to turn off switch 206 and switch 208 under such a fast current change, which can or may cause an undesirable (e.g., fatal) short circuit situation. Therefore, in accordance with an aspect, the system 200 can include additional circuitry to provide a desired relatively small positive signal to the non-inverting inputs of the comparators CP, and CP3.\n\nwhere Rosco is the on state resistance of the MOSFETs.
