The blue curve shows the pre- dicted binding affinity of TAF15 along the XIST transcript. The x-axis represents the relative position of the human XIST transcript (~19 kb). The y-axis shows the gkm-SVM scores of 7 monomers starting from the corresponding position in XIST. Please note that the larger the gkm-SVM score, the higher the aflinity of TAF15. The three colored vertical lines represent locus 1-3 of XIST. The blue curve shows the fitted value of the generalized additive model, while the gray area shows a confidence interval of 95%. As a genomic background, the orange curve shows the average gkm-SVM score of 1,000 sequences randomly sampled\n\nfrom the human genome (hg19). FIG. 2fshows the verification of the XIST-SNF2L\n\n[0053]\n\ninteraction using WB and immunoFISH. The upper pane! shows that Western blotting is performed using anti-human SNF2L antibody after CARPID. From the lysate of HEK293T cells co-transfected with BASU-dCasRx and each of pre-gRNA (control), and the gRNAs specifically targeting locus 1 (XIST-L1), locus 2 (XIST-L2) and locus 3 (XIST-L3), the biotinylated protein is precipitated using streptavidin affinity-coupled magnetic beads. The experi- ment is carried out in three biological replicates and showed representative results. The lower panel shows the immun- oFISH test results of SNF2L and XIST. HEK293T cells are fixed and incubated successively with anti-TAF15 antibody and corresponding secondary antibody with CF 488A (green). A specific oligonucleotide probe labeled as Cy3 (red) is used to detect XIST. The nucleus is counterstained with DAPI (blue). The box area in the left image is enlarged and displayed on the right. The experiment is performed in\n\nthree biological replicates and showed representative results.", "type": "Document"}}
