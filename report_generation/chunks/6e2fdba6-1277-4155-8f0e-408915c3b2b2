The three-dimensional geometry for the test is shown in FIG. 9A. A set of closed loops (length 1-15, 25, 35, 50, 70, 100 um) on the same master made of polymeric materials were pulled out from the elastic cracks. These polymers possess different flexural modulus 6. The replica loop structures experience a drag during releasing from the mold through the cracks; as a result, replica structures with low a and large I were observed to be misshaped. The maximum length 1 of the faithfully released replicas was measured and recorded as the yield point of the material with specific o. The yield points for the closed loops were checked (FIG. 9B) and then were converted to the force F,, as showed in FIG. 2D in main text.\n\n[0110] Study of the Controlled Formation of Elastic Crack", "type": "Document"}}
