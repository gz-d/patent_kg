As part of the comparison, a diode bridge comprising diodes 6(0EPFO6PbF with forward voltage drop of about 0.85V are used to compare with a SDSR (e.g., as depicted in FIG. 2) based at least in part on MOSFETs IPW60R045CP with on-state resistance of 45 m\u00aeQ, wherein the MOSFETs correspond to, for example, switches 202, 204, 206, and 208 in FIG. 2. Resistive, capaci- tive and inductive loads are used for evaluation of the SDSR.\n\ndepicts a diagram of example graph 1400 comprising a rec- tified DC output capacitor voltage waveform associated with the conventional diode bridge in relation to the capacitive- resistive load, and graph 1410 comprising a rectified DC output capacitor voltage waveform associated with the SDSR in relation to the capacitive-resistive load. As can be observed, the rectified DC output voltage waveform for the SDSR is consistent with (e.g., essentially the same as) that of the conventional diode bridge for the same capacitive-resis- tive load.", "type": "Document"}}
