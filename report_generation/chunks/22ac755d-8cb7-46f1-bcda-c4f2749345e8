Pooling\n\n[0117] A general pooling method combining the summa- tion and the multiplication is explored to integrate the flickering and spatial-temporal distortions in assessing the synthesized video quality, which can be written as\n\nB. Quality Prediction Performance Comparisons\n\n[0122] In this subsection, the training dataset, testing dataset, and settings of the SR-3DVQA model are introduced. Then, the quality prediction performances among different methods (including the SR-3DVQA model) compared.\n\nSp=cx(w SF y+ woSA pax f (SF yxSA yp (20)\n\nwhere c, d are weighted parameters to balance the relative importance of the summation and multiplication pooling items. f(.) denotes the nonlinear map function of the flicker distortion score in multiplication pooling. w,, wa are used to weigh the flicker distortion score and the spatial-temporal activity distortion score in summation pooling. When d is set to zero, Equation (20) is degenerated to the summation. Similarly, when c is set to zero, Equation (20) is degenerated to the multiplication.", "type": "Document"}}
