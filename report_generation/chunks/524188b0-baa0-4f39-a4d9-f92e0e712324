Therefore, it is preferred that the second aspect of the present invention calculates the rate-distortion and the third aspect of the invention selects an encoding mode on the basis of a comparison of the rate distortions caused by the various possible encoding modes.\n\nc) a transform module for performing an integer image transform on said residual block D to obtain a transformed residual block F* having a plurality of co-efficients f,,*;", "type": "Document"}}
