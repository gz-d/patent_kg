The Impacts of Pooling Methods\n\nspatial-temporal activity are analyzed in this subsection. For Equation (20), when (c, d) was set as (1, 0), i.e., the summation pooling, the effects of weight parameter pair (wi, w2) on the performance in quality assessment were explored. (wi, w.) were set as (0.5, 0.5), (0.6, 0.4), (0.8, 0.2), (0.4, 0.6), and (0.2, 0.8). The performance measured by PLCC, SROCC, and RMSE of the five combinations of (w,, wa) is listed in the second to sixth row in the table of FIG. 16. It can be observed that (0.5, 0.5) has better performance than other (wi, w) pairs in term of PLCC, SROCC and RMSE. For the multiplication pooling, je (c, d) was set as (0, 1), the role of the map function f(.) was analyzed by comparing the performance of six types of (), Le, \u4e86 CO)=x\uff0c \u2018log 10\u2019, \u2018log 2\u2019 \u2018cubic\u2019, \u2018square\u2019, \u2018square root\u2019. The corresponding results are demonstrated in the eighth to fifteen rows in FIG. 16. It is noted that function \u2018square\u2019 excels all the other five functions. But the multi- plication pooling is a little inferior to the summation pooling even with different mapping function f(x). Based on the best erformance of summation and multiplication pooling, the weight parameters (c, d) in the combination of the two methods had also been investigated. The values of (c, d) were set the same range as (W,, w2). The last five rows in FIG. 16 show the performance. It can be found that when the value of c is equal or greater than d, it achieves the best performance among the five (c, d) combinations. In fact, the best performance is obtained via the summation pooling with (w,, wa) as (0.5, 0.5) or the combination pooling when cis larger than 0.6. Overall, the pooling methods have noticeable impacts on the final performance; the best per- formance is obtained via the summation pooling with (w,, wa) as (0.5, 0.5) and it is simpler form as compared the combination pooling. Therefore, the summation pooling is\n\nC. Statistical Significance Test for SR-3DVQA", "type": "Document"}}
