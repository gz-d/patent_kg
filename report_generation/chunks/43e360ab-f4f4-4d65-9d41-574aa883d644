An example of boost converter is given in FIG. 2. Ifthe input power supply is an AC voltage source (such as the AC mains), an AC-DC power converter with or without power factor correction can be used as the front-stage power converter. An AC-DC con- verter typically consists of a diode rectifier and a DC-DC converter. An example of a flyback type AC-DC converter is shown in FIG. 3. The second-stage power inverter can be, for example, a full-bridge inverter (FIG. 4), a half-bridge inverter (FIG. 5) or a Z-source inverter.\n\n(1) windings charging pad are are to generate sufficient energy for charging these electronic products.\n\n(2) Since the inductive charging method relies on the near- field magnetic coupling of the charging pad (primary energy- transmitting circuit or simply primary circuit) and the energy- receiving module (secondary circuit) inside the electronic products, the charging pad should generate an AC magnetic flux ofa controllable magnitude that can satisfy a wide range of portable electronic loads to be charged.\n\n(3) Since a range of electronic loads may be charged on the same charging pad, there should be a standard operating\n\nat\n\nstage\n\na\n\nstage\n\na\n\na\n\nThe\n\nof the\n\nthat\n\nexcited\n\nable\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nIn\n\nof\n\n(4)\n\nUS 8,228,025 B2\n\n6\n\n5\n\nThe primary winding(s) of the charging pad may consist of\n\nconverter is used to feed an DC-AC inverter that drives the\n\nprimary winding(s) inside an active group of the charging\n\na single coil oran array of coils 1 connected in series as shown\n\nin FIG. 6 where hexagonal coils are shown as an example.
