The control signal is arranged to control the deflector based on A and B. These predeter- mined equations can be referred to as the second set of equations. In one example, this second set of predetermined equations is applied when \u4e2d is smaller than 45 degrees. In another embodiment, this second set of predetermined equa- tions is applied when is smaller than 30 degrees. In another embodiment, this second set of predetermined equations is applied when \u7531 is smaller than 15 degrees. In another embodiment, this second set of predetermined equations is applied when \u4e2d is smaller than 10 degrees. In some embodi- ments, the first set of predetermined equations is used when is out of range for using the second set of predetermined\n\n[0039] FIG. 3 shows a graph that illustrates adjustment of scanning directions of the deflector 120 in FIG. 1. In FIG. 3, A' and B' are the drive signal amplitudes applied in original (skewed) scanning directions x' and y'; the A and B are the drive signal amplitudes applied in adjusted (substantially) orthogonal scanning directions x and y; and \u4e2d is the devia- tion angle.\n\n[0040] This set of equations explains the relationship between the parameters:\n\nARB Y=ARABY.\n\n\u4e00\n\nye-sin > x 4cos \u4e2d \u4e86\n\nequations\n\nequations.", "type": "Document"}}
