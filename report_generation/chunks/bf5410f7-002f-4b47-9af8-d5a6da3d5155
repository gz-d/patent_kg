Firstly, since SW/HW co-design only focuses on hardware designs of the computationally intensive parts, thereby reducing the system development time. Secondly, SW/HW co-design can effectively reduce hardware resources usage by realizing module reuse, so as to leave room for the system to apply more functions and algorithms. Otherwise, the deployment of a single algorithm may occupy the resources in the entire board. Thirdly, SW/HW co-design has a higher flexibility. The deployment of algo- rithms in practical use may be different from the original algorithms when considering different application scenarios. The pure hardware implementation is difficult to further modify to satisfy different applications. But in a SW/HW co-design, the software in processor can be easily upgraded and flexibly adjust the parameters in hardware, which can help algorithms to better integrate into different scenarios. In addition, high-speed data transfer and computation archi- tecture used to increase the overall\n\nare\n\nalgorithms speed.\n\n[0127] The hybrid sofiware/hardware co-design may be useful in the NIST PQC round-3 digital signature scheme in CRYSTALS-Dilithium cryptosystems. In order to target high speed, hardware modules include hybrid NTT/INTT, point-wise multiplier and adder, SHAKE PRNG with tightly coupled samplers are included in the hybrid hardware/ software architecture. To achieve flexibility, the ARM pro- cessor is cooperated with the aforementioned hardware accelerator to compute Dilithium for different security lev- els. The hardware is fully pipelined and parameterized thus could perform different calculations according to the con- figured parameters.", "type": "Document"}}
