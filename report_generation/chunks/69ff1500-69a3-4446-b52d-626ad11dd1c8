The method may be applied to or in connection with one or more devices or systems as described above with reference to one or more figures, such as FIGS. 6A-7. The method provides gradient- enhanced magnetic field that improves manipulation of actuation subject in the workspace so as to perform certain tasks in one or more industrial applications.\n\n[0088] Block 1002 states grouping one or more pairs of electromagnetic devices into one or more groups. A pair of electromagnetic devices may be two electromagnetic devices adjacent to each other, or away from each other, or opposite to each other, or having other physical or electrical relationship per one or more certain criteria. A pair of\n\nelectromagnetic devices may be grouped as one single Two or more pairs may be grouped together.\n\ngroup.\n\n[0089] Block 1004 states forming activation strategies for the one or more groups. The activation strategies include selections, such as which groups are to be activated, the value of energizing current for each electric coil, direction of the energizing current, and distance between each magnetic core and the center of the workspace. Different groups may be energized differently, such as with current of different magnitude or direction or under different energizing fre- quency. In some embodiments, certain groups may not be energized for a period of time or under specified time intervals.", "type": "Document"}}
