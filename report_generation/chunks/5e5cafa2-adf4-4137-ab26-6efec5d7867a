Next, the effective drag force on the captured cell/nucleus can be calculated by integrating its surface stresses around, which is obtained using \u2018Surface Integra- tion\u2019 in COMSOL 5.2a to integrate the stresses in the flow direction on the captured cell/nucleus surface.\n\nClassification Regime\n\n[0144] Classifications of cells are based on the Quadratic Discriminate Analysis (QDA) regime. The classification of cell lines is calculated according to two cell/nucleus prop- erty variables in QDA. Customized scripts are programmed. to classify scatters of two cell variables and elasticity using MATLAB R2017a (MathWorks) to realize QDA.\n\nEmbodiments of the present invention provide a\n\n[0145]\n\nnon-destructive procedure to quantify mechanical properties of cells using microfluidic devices. The quantification pro- cedure can be used to perform measurements on live whole cell and the cells can be easily recollected thereafter by increasing the driving pressure as the procedure does not destruct the cells structures. This makes further analysis of the cells feasible. Further, the results obtained from the proposed quantification procedure are not sensitive to the measurement positions of the cells since the nuclear mechanical properties are calculated using hyperelastic Tat- ara\u2019s theory by measuring whole cell deformations. Thus, accurate mechanical properties can be obtained using the quantification procedure as disclosed herein. The cost for the microfluidic device is also inexpensive as the microfluidic\n\ndevice is made using polydimethylsiloxane and glass slide.", "type": "Document"}}
