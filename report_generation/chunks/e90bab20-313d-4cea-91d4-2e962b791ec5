The under- lying mechanism is that the layered framework undergoes a series of structural transitions among H1, H2 and H3 (space group, R-3m) during the charge-discharge process. The above structural transitions are theoretically inevitable in the NCM materials, leading to repetitive strains that become even more profound as the Ni content increases (~5% of high-voltage c-contraction in NCM811). In the most extreme case, high-density intergranular cracks are induced inside the secondary particles (especially along the primary grain boundaries), which eventually brings about pulveriza- tion of the particles, poor cycling stability and fast battery failure. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electron and Li* transpor- tation kinetics in Ni-rich NCM materials is greatly inferior, especially at the primary grain boundaries. This substan- tially limits their rate capability, another major challenge for the Ni-rich cathodes, to satisfy the high power or quick charge applications.", "type": "Document"}}
