In many cases this will imply that the second winding is located concentrically with respect to the first winding, though other positions may be necessary depending on the shape of the first winding and the resulting flux pattern.\n\nFIG. 8A shows a schematic of a planar inductive charging platform based on a single planar primary winding 7 that surrounds a charging surface. In this context the term \u201cpri- mary\u201d is used in the same sense as a transformer, and the energy receiving element will comprises the \u201csecondary\u201d.
