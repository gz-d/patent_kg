Note that the PTFE surface of TENG is prepared using the same method as in the case of TIDE-G. Figs. 8a and 8b show the optical image of the as- fabricated droplet-based TENG as well as the schematic drawing of its basic working mechanism, respectively. Prior to the contact of droplet with the PTFE, the amount of charges on ITO (positive) the same as that of the PTFE (negative) because of the electrostatic induction. Thus, there is no current flow from ITO to ground (i). When a water droplet leaves the PTFE surface after impacting (il), It becomes positively charged while the PTFE is more negatively charged as a result of contact electrification. Accordingly, a current flow between the ground and ITO electrode is induced (iv). shown In Figs. 8c and 8c for a single droplet, the output voltage and the amount of transferred charges is ~ -0.4 V and ~ 0.075 nC, respectively, both of which are negligible as opposed to those the case of TIDE-G. Moreover, for each experiment, the amount of the transferred charges in TENG is measured to be identical with the charge carried by the departing droplet (see Fig. 8d), confirming that the electricity generation from the TENG indeed originates from the triboelectric effect, an interfacial phenomenon by nature. Note that by continuous droplet impinging or ion- injection method, the amount of negative charges on PTFE surface can be enhanced, which can then induce positive charges on ITO. However, these positive charges could not be released from ITO due to the attraction by these negative charges on PTFE, and there is no pronounced electricity generation, which is in striking contrast to the case of TIDE-G. All these results convincingly highlight the unique advantage of TIDE-G, which is characterized with a bulk effect\n\nis\n\nAs\n\nin\n\n25", "type": "Document"}}
