For example, the mapping of respective signals (e.g., received optical signals from the control region) to corresponding types of visual content and/or corresponding display modes (and/or desired barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern) can further include mapping to corresponding control signals respectively associated with the correspond- ing types of visual content and/or corresponding display modes. In still another aspect, the barrier control component 110 can transmit the control signal to the barrier component 108 via a wireline or wireless communication connection between the barrier control component 110 and barrier com- ponent 108.\n\nIn response to the received control signal, the barrier com- ponent 108 can be controlled (e.g., automatically or dynami- cally, in real time) to automatically switch to (or remain in) or select a specified display mode, such as 2-D mode, 3-D ste- reoscopic mode, or 3-D autostereoscopic mode, wherein there can be corresponding barrier pattern modes and/or bar- rier patterns that can be utilized in the respective display modes to facilitate desirably presenting 2-D content or 3-D\n\nregion 112.\n\nWhen a signal is only embedded in certain video images\n\ncontrol signal from the barrier control component 110.
