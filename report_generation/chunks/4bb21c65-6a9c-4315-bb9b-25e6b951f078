The R-3m symmetry is strictly characterized by the equal TM-O bond lengths in octahedra, where the ligand field is strongly coupled with the local electronic structure. Theoretically, the d\u2019 configuration of Ni** in the octahedral crystal field could split into a low-spin toe\u00b0eg! state. This effect will induce local distortion of octahedra, which lowers the average symmetry from hex- agonal R-3m to monoclinic C2/m. Nevertheless, the pres- ence of Ni**, derived from the substitution of Co and Mn, triggers the hopping between Ni** and Ni** states, which inhibits the Jahn-Teller octahedral distortion and gives rise to the hexagonal R-3m symmetry. In fact, the locally dis- torted monoclinic structure has been previously proposed as a potential structure-stabilizer for R-3m lattice by preventing the interlayer collapse. Furthermore, this monoclinic phase has been demonstrated to exhibit a higher mixed conduc- tivity. Although moderately distorted, the C2/m lattice matches well with the R-3m structure, and their transform could be possibly manipulated by tuning the electronic configurations. The present invention relates to a novel architecture that integrates the monoclinic and hexagonal the electronic\n\nstructures through tuning the performance of the Ni-rich NCM materials.\n\nstates to optimize", "type": "Document"}}
