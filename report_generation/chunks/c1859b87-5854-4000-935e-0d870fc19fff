In some embodiments, the number of rows of oscillators and the number of columns of oscillators are the same. In some embodiments, the number of rows of oscillators and the number of columns of oscillators are different.\n\n[0037] In some embodiments, the plurality of radiator units comprises, at least, a first radiator unit and a second radiator unit arranged in the same row, and, the radiator comprises a coupling arrangement electrically coupling the first radiator unit and the second radiator unit in the same row.\n\n[0038] In some embodiments, the coupling arrangement (that electrically couples the first radiator unit and the second radiator unit in the same row) comprises an even- mode-shorted coupler for enabling or sustaining an out-of- phase coupling mode between (i) the first oscillator of one of the first radiator unit and the second radiator unit and (ii) the second oscillator of another one of the first radiator unit and the second radiator unit.\n\nIn some embodiments, the even-mode-shorted cou-\n\n[0039]", "type": "Document"}}
