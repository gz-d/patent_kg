In one embodiment, the correction device 1 can comprise a support member 10 of various forms. In an exem- plary embodiment, the support member 10 can comprise a supporting rod 12 of various shapes. For example, the sup- porting rod 12 can have a general curved shape, such as a \u201cC\u201d or \u201cS\u201d shape, or other shapes depending on the sagittal profile of the spine. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be contoured to conform to the natural spine curvature(s). For example, the support member 10 can be contoured to assume the normal degree of spine kyphosis and/or lordosis. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in FIG. 14, the support member 10 can comprise a curved portion 14, which can be formed such as by bending the support member 10 to conform to a deformed spine portion 4 to be corrected.\n\nThe support member 10 can be placed in various positions in relation to the spine 2. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 can be positioned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. In another exemplary embodiment, the curved support member 10 can be positioned on the posterior side of the vertebrae and longitudinally aligned with the vertebrae so that the hump of the curved support member 10 can be posi- tioned at the posterior side of the body.", "type": "Document"}}
