In light of this, the anti-freezing property of the battery was verified. The battery was immersed in water in a glass vessel and stored at -20\u00b0 C. to form an ice solid. As shown in FIG. 23A, the ice-solid battery was still capable to power the electronic watch, and its specific capacity was well-retained over 90.22% after 72-hour storage at -20\u00b0 C. (FIG. 23B). More- over, when the battery was immersed in boiling water, it was still able to power an electric watch for at least 64 min (FIG. 24), demonstrating the impressive anti-heating property of the battery.", "type": "Document"}}
