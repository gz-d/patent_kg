Alterna- tively, the p type semiconductor element comprises Bismuth Antimony Telluride (Bi, :Sb ;Te;). In the illustrated con- figuration the n type semiconductor element comprises Lead Telluride (PbTe). Alternatively, the n type semiconductor element comprises Bismuth Telluride(Bi,Te;). The first electrode 704 and the second electrode 706 comprise copper or aluminium contacts. The electrodes 704, 706 are prefer- ably thin film electrodes. The substrates, semiconductor elements and the electrodes are preferably formed of a thin film in order to create a device having a small footprint.\n\n[0181] The thermoelectric module 710 comprises a large seebeck coeflicient. The p type semiconductor elements 712 and the n type semiconductor elements 714 comprise low thermal conductivity. The large seebeck constant and the Jow thermal conductivity results in a sharp rise and fall time of the current signal e.g. a rise time of 150ms and a fall time of 200ms. The sensor 700 functions as an efficient touch sensor having a high responsivity. FIG. 8C illustrates a graph of the sensor responsivity. In one example form the thermoelectric device 700 ie. a sensor 700 comprise a sensor responsivity of about 0.2870 WV W-'. The sensor can be constructed to have a desired sensor responsivity depend- ing on the thickness of the p type and n type semiconductor elements 712, 714. The sensing junction ie. the region of overlap between the p type semiconductor element and the n type semiconductor element can be as required.", "type": "Document"}}
