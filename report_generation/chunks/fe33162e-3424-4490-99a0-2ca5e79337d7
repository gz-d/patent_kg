In a preferred embodiment, the modified protein comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence includes an alanine at the N413 position.\n\npresent invention and gene-editing system a guide RNA (gRNA) establishes a in a cell. CRISPR-SaCas9 proteins, guided by the gRNA, bind and cleave a predetermined target sequence of a target gene at a specific location, ie. an on-target site, on a target DNA molecule, thereby resulting in a double stranded chromosomal break at the on-target site that leads to site-specific modifications by the cell. The \u201ctarget gene\u201d as used herein refers to a gene of interest. The Cas9 protein recognizes a short DNA sequence, the proto- spacer adjustment motif (PAM), found downstream of the target sequence, usually three to four nucleotides down- stream from the cut site. The PAM sequence is an essential component of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and the Cas9 pro- tein will not bind to or cleave the target DNA sequence without the downstream PAM sequence. The SaCas9 pro- tein, for example, recognizes the canonical PAM sequence\n\nIn another example embodiment, the modified protein includes an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 2 or a homologue thereof wherein the modified protein comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence includes three E782K, N968K, R1015H substitutions and a mutation at an N413 position. In a preferred embodiment, the modified protein comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence includes an alanine at the N413 position.", "type": "Document"}}
