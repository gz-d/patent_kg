In an exemplary embodiment, the locking elements 62 can be in the form of \"C\" shaped clamps, which is adapted to be placed on the support members 10, 10a, and 10b. The locking elements 62 can be made of various mate- rials, such as an NiTi alloy. [0055] The locking elements 62 can be used in various manners. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more locking elements 62 can be set in a closed position at the time of surgery to retain the support members 10, 10a, and 10b in an appropriate position while other lock- ing elements 62 can be set at an open position. When the spine correction comes to finish or satisfactory, the closed locking elements 62 can be opened and the open locking element 62 can be closed. In another exemplary embodiment, the locking elements 62 can be set in an open position at the time of surgery to retain the support members 10, 10a, and 10b in an appropriate position. When the correction comes to a full or substantially full completion, the locking elements 62 can then be tight- ened. [0056] The locking and unlocking processes can be activated by various mechanisms, such as by a shape memory effect found in a NiTi alloy or by the use of a", "type": "Document"}}
