In an aspect, the zero-crossing controller component 2800 can provide or supply a desired relatively small positive voltage signal to the non-inverting inputs of a comparator (e.g., CP). The small positive voltage signal can be generated from the input voltage of Phase C as illustrated. in FIG. 27, which illustrates a diagram of example driving waveforms 2700 of the Phase B low-side portion (e.g., SDGD component 2122) of the SDGD subsystem. In an aspect, the small positive voltage signal can facilitate ensuring that the comparator CP, can operate to apply a desired voltage to the gate of the power switch 2110 (M;) to switch the power switch 2110 (Ms)in time at or near the zero-crossing point to prevent an undesirable short circuit situation. In another aspect, the zero-crossing controller component 2800 can con- tain a zener diode D,, which can have a desired predefined rating voltage (e.g., 1OV). When the voltage vy begins to rise from zero volts, the voltage of the zener diode D_, will rise until the voltage level reaches the predefined rating voltage of the zener diode D_;. The zener diode D_, can maintain this voltage at the predefined rating voltage with very small fluc- tuation. In still another aspect, the zero-crossing controller component 2800 can include resistors Rs and R3, that can form a voltage divider to facilitate scaling down the voltage signal (with a desired amount of scaling down) with reduced fluctuation, and also can include capacitor C,4, and resistors", "type": "Document"}}
