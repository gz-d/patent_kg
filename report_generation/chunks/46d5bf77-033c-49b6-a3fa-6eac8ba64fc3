In this embodiment, the antenna 100 is configured as a dual-frequency antenna incorporating a microwave dielectric resonator antenna and millimeter-wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. The antenna 100 generally includes a dielectric block 102 mounted on a ground plane 104. The dielectric block 102 has a groove 106 with conductor 108 arranged inside. The antenna 100 is arranged to be excited to operate as a microwave dielectric resonator antenna and a millimeter- wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna.\n\n[0029] FIG. 7 is a photograph of another antenna fabri- cated based on the antenna of FIGS. 1A to 1C;\n\n[0030] FIG. 8 is a graph showing the measured and simulated reflection coeflicients of the dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna of FIG. 7 and simulated reflection coefficient of a dielectric resonator antenna of a reference antenna corresponding to (but different from) the antenna o.
