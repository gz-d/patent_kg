FIG. 5A depicts a scheme diagram about a wearer TG wearing on the detector DD under different wearing angles. Assuming the wearer TG and the detector DD are located in a space defined by X axis, Y axis, and Z axis perpendicular to each other. The left part, middle part, and the right part in the FIG. 5A depict the schematic diagrams of the wearer TG wearing on the detec- tor DD in the FIG. 1A under 0 degree, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees, respectively. A wearing angle is defined as an included angle between a facing direction of the receiving electrode layer (e.g., as marked as the dark grey shade area) and a YZ plane defined by the Y axis and Z axis. FIG. 5B depicts a step flow chart of determining the optimal wearing angle according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 6 depicts different microgestures (a)~(j) and corre- sponding wearer\u2019s rating. FIG. 7 depicts an auto-encoder- decoder model according an embodiment of the present invention. The detailed steps S100~S150 for optimizing device wearing angle/orientation are fully described in com- bination with FIGS. 5A, 5B, 6 and 7 as follows.\n\nReferring to FIGS. 5B and 6. In the step S100: A microgesture set including a plurality of discrete microges- tures (a)~(j) different from each other is determined, as shown in the FIG. 6. A discrete microgesture is defined as a gesture performed by two different fingers that is completed with a sequence of motions (e.g., drawing a circle) and is mapped to a specific command/event. In some embodi- ments, the microgestures (a)~(j) include, for example, 10 T2I microgestures, such as (a) Tap microgesture, (b) Double Tap microgesture, (c) Swipe Up microgesture, (d) Swipe\n\nUS 11,822,732 B1\n\n9\n\n10\n\n(j)", "type": "Document"}}
