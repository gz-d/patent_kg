Note that although only four rotation angles are presented in FIG. 16 (c), (d), the focus can actually con- tinuously steer along the radial direction by continuous, synchronous rotation of the metalens doublet. FIG. 16(6) shows the simulated power densities on the focal plane of the metalens pair. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the focal point at the origin is around 1 5 mm and increases to 3 mm when scans to the edge which is attributed. to the reduced projected aperture of the metalens. Within the whole focus steering range, the near-field sidelobe levels (SLLs) are all below -14 dB as shown in FIG. 16(4). Meanwhile, the focus scan loss, defined as the discrepancy of electric field intensity at the focal point when scanning, is around 4.5 dB.\n\n[0055] To demonstrate the advantages of the multi-focus Metalens #2 design compared to the single-focus metalens, metalens pairs using two different Metalenses #2 were modelled and simulated in Ansys HFSS. Simulated results\n\nUS 2021/0384638 Al\n\nshowing superior focus-steering performances in terms near-field SLLs and scan loss in the whole scan range are obtained for our multi-focus Metalens #2 (for details of the focus-steering performance improvement, see FIGS. 18(a)- 18(d)).\n\nazimuthal\n\nWhen the metalens dou-", "type": "Document"}}
