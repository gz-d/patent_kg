Ductility is also the basis of modern structural design approaches (e.g. moment redistribution). In seismic design, in particular, duc- tility becomes an extremely important consideration. The issue of ductility and methods of increasing ductility is one of the most active areas in the study of concrete structures. There are a number of existing approaches used to improve the structural ductility of FRP reinforced concrete members, some of them are equally applicable to steel reinforced con- crete members:", "type": "Document"}}
