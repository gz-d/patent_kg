Experiment results show that before post-process- ing treatment, nanofibers slide under tensile strain, however after post-processing treatment, since nanofibers are linked to form a bonded structure, sliding between nanofibers is restricted and therefore the broken strain in embodiments 1-16 is enhanced. Post-processing treatment provides physi- cal bonding between the electrospun film fibers, enabling an electrospun three-dimensional network structure with strengthening points (the contact points between nanofibers) is constructed, realizing electrospun film prepared according to the present invention with high strength. The obtained electrospun film has better mechanical properties, moisture permeability and hydrostatic pressure resistance. Mean- while, the preparation according to the present invention is\n\nstreamlined, simple, and viable to be industrialized.", "type": "Document"}}
