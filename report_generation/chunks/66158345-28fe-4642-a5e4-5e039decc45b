[0026] The secondary circuit used by Choi in the prior art can only pick up a sufficiently large voltage from the primary circuit at high frequency (950 kHz). The use of such high frequency leads to many shortcomings such as high AC resistance in the windings, reduced energy efficiency, high switching losses and high EMI emission in both primary and secondary circuits. Unlike the stand- ard secondary winding used in this prior art, the winding in this invention (Figs.11(a) and (b) and Figs.12(a) and (b)) serves as both an energy pick-up coil and a resonant inductor (Lr). A small AC capacitor (1306, Cr) is connect- ed in series (or possibly in parallel) with the coil 1302 (an inductor) as shown in Fig.13 to form a resonant tank, which is then connected to the diode rectifier 1308 with a DC capacitor 1310 (Cdc). The diode rectifier turns the resonant AC voltage picked up by the resonant tank into a DC voltage and the DC capacitor reduces the voltage ripple in order to maintain a fairly stiff DC voltage for the charging circuit. It should be noted that the diode rectifier can be of a standard type as shown in Fig.13(b), or it can be of a type with voltage doubling (sometimes called volt- age doubler) as shown in Fig.13(c). The use of a voltage regulator can ensure a stable DC voltage for charging the battery [0027] The use of the small resonant capacitor (Cr) is very important. The resonant frequency (fr) of the reso- nant tank formed by Lr and Cr can be expressed as:", "type": "Document"}}
