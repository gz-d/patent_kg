The subject specification can result in a net cost reduction stemming in part from a reduction in the size of the heatsink to be employed when using the multi-phase SDSR as com- pared to a traditional diode rectifier as well as the energy- saving (e.g., power loss reduction), which can more than compensate for any potential minor increase in the compo- nent counts of the inexpensive and low-power components in the high-side portion and low-side portion. In another aspect, the multi-phase SDSR disclosed herein can achieve high sys- tem compactness as compared to conventional rectifiers, due at least in part to reduced heat dissipation of the multi-phase SDSR relative to conventional rectifiers.", "type": "Document"}}
