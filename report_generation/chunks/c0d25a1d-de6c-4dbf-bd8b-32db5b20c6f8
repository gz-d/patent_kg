The control unit 112 include one or more of an information handling system and/or a circuit (e.g., analog circuit, field-programmable gate array circuit) for providing a control signal (e.g., current, voltage, etc.) to the deflector, a camera, etc.\n\n[0030] The control unit 112 determines the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction provided by the deflector 120. For example, the control unit 112 may com- pare the first scanning direction with a first reference direc- tion and compare the second scanning direction with a second reference direction (the first reference direction and the second reference direction are substantially orthogonal). The control unit 112 may include a processor to analyze an image of the specimen X produced by the imaging apparatus 100. This process could involve the control unit 112 deter- mining an extent of orthogonality of the first scanning direction and the second scanning direction.\n\n[0035] FIG. 2 shows a method 200 for controlling a deflector in an imaging apparatus, such that the imaging apparatus 100 of FIG. 1, in one embodiment of the inven- tion. The imaging apparatus to which the method 200 can be applied includes an electron gun arranged to provide elec- tron beam to scan a specimen, and a deflector arranged to move the electron beam in a first scanning direction and a second scanning direction that are in the same plane for scanning the specimen.\n\n[0031] The control unit 112 also processes the determined first scanning direction and the determined second scanning direction based on predetermined equations.\n\n[0032] The predetermined equations may include", "type": "Document"}}
