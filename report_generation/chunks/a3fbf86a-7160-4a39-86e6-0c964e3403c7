The step of assembling may include the following steps in sequential order: placing and pressing the o-ring 26 onto the smaller case 24\u2019, placing the spring 28\u2019 on top and then the spacer 30' and anode 32'/32\" (with the anode 32/32\" facing upwards), placing the separator 34' on top as centered as possible, dropping the electrolyte (e.g., about 100 pL to about 300 wL) onto the separator 34', placing the cathode 36/36' on top (with the cast film facing the anode 32/32\"), and the 22'\n\nplacing\n\nlarger case\n\non top.\n\n[0069] Hereinafter, the present invention is described more specifically by way of examples, but the present invention is not limited thereto.\n\n[0070] Unless otherwise specifically provided, all tests herein are conducted at standard conditions which include a room and testing temperature of 25\u00b0 C., sea level (1 atm.) pressure, pH 7, and all measurements are made in metric units. Furthermore, all percentages, ratios, etc. herein are by weight, unless specifically indicated otherwise. It is under- stood that unless otherwise specifically noted, the materials compounds, chemicals, etc. described herein are typically commodity items and/or industry-standard items available from a variety of suppliers worldwide. All the reagents and solvents are used without further purification unless other- wise specified. The n-butanol, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and 1,4-dioxane are purchased as extra dry grade with water lower than 50\n\nppm.\n\nExample 1\n\nSynthesis of BHT-BQ-COF", "type": "Document"}}
