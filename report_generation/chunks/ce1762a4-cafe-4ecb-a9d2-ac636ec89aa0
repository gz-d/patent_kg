The PIN diodes are controllable by control signals\n\n[0137]\n\n(e.g., space time coding sequence of \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d) provided by a controller such as field-programmable gate array(s) (not shown). Specifically, in this embodiment, the PIN diodes are each selectively operable in an ON state and an OFF state, for affecting operation of the corresponding slot to which they are operably coupled. The two PIN diodes of the same slot may be controlled by the same control signal or other- wise arranged to operate simultaneously in either the ON state or the OFF state, thus selectively operating the corre- sponding slot in either the radiating state or the non- radiating state. The PIN diodes of the same slot may be biased by a biasing circuit (or a portion of it) to the same bias state (forward-biased, no bias, etc.). In this embodiment, the biasing circuit is formed or arranged in the lower electrically\n\nconductive layer of the substrate integrated waveguide 404.\n\n[0138] The following description provides further details on various aspects or example operations of the metasurface antenna 400. As used herein, the metasurface antenna 400 may be referred to as a universal metasurface antenna 400.\n\n[0139] The following description makes reference to the various Figures in an order different from the order as the Figures appear. Thus, for ease of presentation, some brief description of the various Figures is provided before further description is provided.\n\n[0140] FIGS. 4A to 9 generally relate to the universal metasurface antenna 400 arranged for independent controls of all fundamental EM wave properties.
