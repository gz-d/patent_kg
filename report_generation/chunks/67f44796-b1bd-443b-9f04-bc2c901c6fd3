Four electrodes were used as the neural electrodes and another four electrodes were used as EMG electrodes. Among the EMG electrodes, two were arranged to be implanted in gastrocnemius muscle and two were arranged to be implanted in tibialis anterior muscle. The remaining channels were grounded with grounding site (right corner pin) and reference electrode was configured on the left corner. Silver conductive paint was used to increase the conductance and the whole assembly was covered with epoxy glue.", "type": "Document"}}
