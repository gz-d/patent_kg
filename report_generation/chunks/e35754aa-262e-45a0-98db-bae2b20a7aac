The hydrophobic material, in yet another embodiment, may include compounds derived from nature, such as plants. The compounds may be bioactive compounds extracted from, or synthesized from, different plants. In a preferred embodiment, the hydrophobic material is an essential oil. Preferably, the hydrophobic material includes a compound selected from a group consisting of carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene and limonene, or a mixture of two or more of these compounds. In a particular embodi- ment, the hydrophobic material comprises carvacrol and thymol. In a further preferred embodiment, the hydrophobic material includes carvacrol. For example, carvacrol has properties such as water immiscibility with a saturation\n\n[0111] The inventors also found that the composition showed self-healing properties by conducting healable tests. The composition showed increased self-healing efficiency with prolonged healing times, i.e. approximately 20% heal- ing efficiency at 10 minutes to 95% healing efficiency at 40 minutes, and heating to 70\u00b0 C. significantly accelerated the healing process. The healing efficiency of the composition at 40 minutes was 95.6% relative to a pristine sample, sug- gesting the beneficial self-healing capabilities of the com- position.", "type": "Document"}}
