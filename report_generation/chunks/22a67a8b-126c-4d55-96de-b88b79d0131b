FIG. 15 depicts a diagram of an example graph 1500 of measured input voltage and input current wave- forms of the conventional diode rectifier when associated with the inductive-resistive load. FIGS. 16 and 17 relate to example results when the system 200 comprising the single- phase SDSR is associated with (e.g., connected to) an induc- tive-resistive load. FIG. 16 illustrates a diagram of an example graph 1600 of example gate-source voltage signals (Vgs) of the high-side portion switches (e.g., switches 202 and 204, which can be (VCSD) MOSFETs) (represented respectively as a pink-colored waveform and a green-colored waveform) of the SDSR, the input voltage (represented as a lue-colored waveform), and the input current (represented as a green-colored waveform) for the SDSR in relation to (e.g., when connected to) an inductive-resistive load (e.g., when the system 200 is subject to an inductive-resistive load) in accordance with an aspect. In relation to the graph 1600, FIG. 17 depicts a diagram of an example graph 1700 com- rising example corresponding gate-source voltage signals (Vgs) for the low-side portion switches (e.g., switches 206 and 208 (CCSD) MOSFETs) (represented respectively as a ink-colored waveform and a dark green-colored waveform) of the SDSR, and an input current (represented as a light- green-colored waveform), for the SDSR (e.g., of system 200), in accordance with an aspect. It is noted that, with regard to FIG. 17, the input current waveform (light-green-colored waveform in FIG. 17) looks exactly the same as, or at least substantially the same as, a typical expected current wave- form for a conventional diode bridge with an LR load, as shown in FIG. 15. These practical measurements confirm that the SDSR disclosed herein can behave like a conventional", "type": "Document"}}
