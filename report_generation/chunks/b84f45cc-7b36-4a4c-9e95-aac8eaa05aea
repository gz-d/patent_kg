The conductor strip 108 on the base surface may provide the ground plane of the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. As shown in FIGS. 1A to 1C, the dielectric block 102 further includes an generally cylindrical opening 116 arranged at and continuous with a central portion of the groove 106. The opening 116 has a diameter \u00ae, The opening extends below and generally perpendicular to the elongation direction of the groove 106. The ground plane 104 includes a corre- sponding through-hole 104B aligned with the opening 116. An L-probe 118 extending through the openings 116, 104B is used to receive an excitation signal (e.g., from a SMA connector 120) to operate the antenna 100 as the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. The L-probe 118 includes a vertical arm portion 118A with length L, and diameter Ta and a hori- zontal arm portion 118B with length L,, and height H, continuous with the vertical arm portion (FIGS. 1C and 1D). The horizontal arm portion extends generally parallel to the elongation direction of the groove 106 (FIG. 1B). As best shown in FIG. 1C, a 50Q air-filled metallic cable 122 is also arranged in the opening and generally coaxially with the vertical arm portion of the L-probe 118. The cable 122 has an outer diameter \u4e2d; and an inner diameter \u00ae,. A suppressor in the form of a half-ring sleeve 124 with height H, extends from an end of the coaxial cable 122 to introduce an opposite", "type": "Document"}}
