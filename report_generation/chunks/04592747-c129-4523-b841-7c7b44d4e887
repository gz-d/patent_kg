Establishment of CARPID Technology\n\n[0100] Referring to FIG. 1a, the present invention pro- vides a method called CRISPR-assisted RNA-protein inter- action detection (CARPID), which can be used to detect RBP bound to endogenous IncRNA transcripts in living cells. The present invention designs a guide RNA (gRNA) array, which is composed of two gRNA sequences separated by a 30 nt direct repeat (DR) to target two adjacent loci on same IncRNA transcript (FIG. 4a). In theory, this can improve targeting specificity, thereby reducing background noise.\n\n[0101] In order to identify the RBP that binds to the target IncRNA, dCasRx is fused with the engineered biotin ligase BASU in the present invention.

In order to optimize the reaction conditions, various induction times are tried (FIG. 4c). The present invention also compares the enzymatic activity by reversing the order of BASU and dCasRx in the fusion protein, and no obvious difference is observed (FIG. 4c). The present invention selects BASU- dCasRx, and the cells are treated with 200 uM biotin for 15 minutes in the subsequent analysis, as the shortest but sufficient reaction time. By co-expressing BASU-dCasRx fusion protein with gRNA targeting specific regions of IncRNA (XIST), biotinylation is induced and then bioti- nylated proteins are enriched for mass spectrometry-medi- ated protein identification and quantification (FIG. 1a), so as to carry out the CARPID. No significant changes in gene expression are observed in cells overexpressing BASU- dCasRx and gRNA, confirming that CARPID does not change the physiological functions of transfected cells (FIG.\n\n4d).\n\nExample 2 Performance Evaluation of CARPID", "type": "Document"}}
