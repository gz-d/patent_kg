In some embodiments, the magnetic core is allowed to realize a linear movement in a range from 50 mm to 110 mm towards the center of the workspace, such as 50 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, 90 mm, 110 mm, thereby significantly modifying size of the workspace, thereby meeting requirements for a wide range of industrial applications. In some other embodiments, the linear move- ment of the magnetic core may be smaller than 50 mm, such as 10 mm, 20 mm, 30 mm, or larger than 110 mm, such as 130 mm, 160 mm. For example, in some embodiments, the magnetic core is allowed to realize a linear movement in a range from 1 mm to 160 mm towards the center of the workspace. The changeable workspace facilitates a wider range of industrial applications, such as the clinical research and applications for both animal experiments and human\n\ntrail experiments.\n\n[0061] Optionally and as illustrated, a frame 370 is pro- vided to improve coupling or mounting between the mag- netic core 320 and the motor 350. The frame 370 provides an improved mounting structure for the electromagnetic device 300. The frame 370 may include or be formed of magnetic materials.\n\n[0062] FIG. 4A illustrates two electromagnetic devices connected via a magnetic bridge according to certain embodiments of the present invention.
