However, fibers, in particular nanofibers, within each film layer and in different layers have no bonding therebetween, therefore film layers, pre- pared by the electrospun fibers, are easily separated. There- fore, although these materials are waterproof and moisture- permeable but have weak mechanical properties in general.\n\n[0005] The present invention seeks to address such prob- lems, or at least to provide an alternative to the public. It is desirable to provide an electrospun film with bonded struc- ture thus providing high mechanical properties.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0006]\n\nIna\n\nfirst\n\nof the\n\ninvention, it relates\n\naspect present to a method for preparing a polymer film, comprising the following steps: a) preparing a polymer film with a polymer solution prepared from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and/ or thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU); b) preparing a mixed solvent selected from a group consisting of dimethylforma- mide, dimethylacetamide, ethanol, water, or any combina- tion thereof, wherein said mixed solvent is characterized by the solubility of said mixed solvent to the polymer selected for said polymer solution and/or the contact angle of said mixed solvent on said polymer film; c) wetting said polymer film with said mixed solvent; and d) subjecting the wet\n\npolymer film to thermal treatment under pressure.\n\n[0007] In one embodiment, the solubility of said mixed solvent to the polymer selected for said polymer solution is 4.2 wt % to 11.2 wt %.\n\n[0008] In another embodiment, the contact angle of said mixed solvent on said polymer film is 29\u00b0 to 83\u00b0.\n\nJun. 20, 2024\n\n[0009]\n\nAdvantageously, said wet polymer film is subjected", "type": "Document"}}
