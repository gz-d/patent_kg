Therefore, spinoc- erebellar ataxia like symptoms appears in DKO due to dysfunction of input and output pathways.\n\n[0086] All experiments were followed as per the guideline of Government of Hong Kong (SAR), Department of Health. Adult male Lhx1/5 DKO and control mice (8-10 weeks old) were used. Neurobehavioral assessment for motor coordination deficit was evaluated by rotarod test, pole climb test, beam walking test, walking track analysis test and videokinematics, electrophysiological test (gastroc- nemius EMG) before and after DCN stimulation.\n\nAnalysis of EMG Signals\n\n[0092] As described above, four EMG electrodes implanted in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles the mice.
