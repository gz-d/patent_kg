For ease of comparison with the focus- ing DRA 112 of FIGS. 2a and 24, the rectangular DR 16 was designed to resonate at the resonance frequency of its hemi- spherical counterpart of FIGS. 2a and 2b. The DR 16 was excited in its fundamental broadside TE,,, mode using a vertical excitation strip. FIGS. la and 16 shows the configu- ration, with \u00a9 =7, W=50 mm, H=22 mm, g=2 mm, d=1.57 mm, w,=12 mm, and 1,=22 mm. The same masked solar cell was used again in this investigation.", "type": "Document"}}
