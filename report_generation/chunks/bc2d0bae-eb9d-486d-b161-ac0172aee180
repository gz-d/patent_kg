While extensive efforts have been made to harvest hydrodynamic energy in the format of raindrop, river/ocean wave, tide and others, achieving high output power density of electricity generation remains challenging.\n\nThe present invention seeks to provide an improved generator which makes use of energy from impacting liquid to generate electrically, or at least to provide an alternative to the public.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccording to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electricity generator resembling a transistor and powered by impacting liquid droplets, comprising a glass substrate defining an upwardly facing surface and a downwardly facing surface, wherein the substrate includes |) a region with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated on the upwardly facing surface and acting as a virtual source and |i) an electrode arranged adjacent the PTFE coated region on the Upwardly facing surface and acting as a drain in that the PTFE coated region and the electrode are positioned on the upwardly facing surface to receive an impacting water droplet acting as a gate, and wherein circuitry of the generator connects the virtual source and the drain via an electrical connection passing the downwardly facing surface, whereby electricity is harvested via the electrical connection.\n\nPreferably, the glass substrate may be an ITO glass slide or a portion of an ITO glass slide.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\n2\n\nsuitably, the PTFE may be conformed to exist in form of a flat film on the upwardly facing surface. The PTFE film may have a density of 2.1 to 2.2 g/cm\u00ae. Studies leading to the present invention have shown that this density range can enhance the performance of the generator.", "type": "Document"}}
