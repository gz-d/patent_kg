The subset of solar cells can detect and/or be illuminated by the optical signal to facili- tate controlling switching of display modes and/or can con- vert the light energy of the optical signal into electrical energy to generate power based at least in part on the optical signal. The barrier control component can include a power supply component, and the power generated by the subset of solar cells can be transferred to the power supply component. The power supply component can store the power in a battery component and/or can provide some or all of the generated. power to other components of the barrier control component and/or components (e.g., barrier component, projector screen, component) associated with the barrier control component to at least partially power operation of the barrier control com- ponent, barrier component, and/or projector screen compo-\n\nTurning figures, a diagram an example system 100 that can desirably control (e.g., auto- matically or dynamically) switching or selection of a multi- dimensional display mode of a barrier component (e.g., multi-mode barrier component) to facilitate presentation of a visual image(s) in a desired multi-dimensional display mode, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In an aspect, the system 100 can comprise a projector screen component 102 that can display or present video content (e.g., movie, television show, video, photograph, etc.) and/or audio to a viewer perceiving or observing the projector screen component 102. In accordance with various embodiments, the projector screen component 102 can be or can comprise a projector or display screen, such as, for example, a rear projection screen, that can be struc-\n\nthe\n\ndetected audio\n\nIn some implementations, the barrier control component", "type": "Document"}}
