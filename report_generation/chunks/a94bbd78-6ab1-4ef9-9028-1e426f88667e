A long fiber is easier to generate Stokes wavelength via stimulated-Raman-scattering and makes the Raman thresh- old lower. In this embodiment a loom graded-index multi- mode fiber 320 is used to increase the stimulated-Raman- scattering threshold. Although the loom stimulated-Raman- scattering fiber 320 is multi-mode for the pump light, the generated 558 nm is nearly single mode due to the Raman beam clean-up effect. A half-wave plate HWP3 adjusts the polarization of the incident light to maximize the 558 nm energy. A short pass filter SPF (RPES70SP, OMEGA) down- stream of the loom fiber 320 is arranged to reject wave- lengths longer than 570 nm. Respective fiber couplers FC1 and FC2 are placed upstream and downstream of the multi-\n\nmode fiber 320.\n\n[0082] A 550 nm long-pass dichroic mirror 340 (TS50Ipxr-UF1, CHROMA) is used to combine the 545 nm and 558 nms. A beam splitter, e.g., a 10/90 beam splitter 350, combines the direct 532 nm with the delayed 545 nm and 558 nm. A variable neutral density filter NDF1, NDF2, NDF3 (NDC-50C-2, Thorlabs Inc) is added to each respec- tive path to adjust the output energy. Finally, the three wavelengths are coupled into an OR-PAM probe 304 via a fiber coupler FCS and 2 m single-mode fiber 360 (P1-460B- FC-2, Thorlabs Inc).\n\n[0083] In this example, the fiber coupling efficiencies for all the single-mode beams are higher than 50%. When coupling the 558 nm beam to the 2 m single-mode fiber, because the 558 nm is not 100% single mode, the coupling efficiency is ~30%. The pulse energy on the sample surface for each wavelength is higher than 100 nJ.", "type": "Document"}}
