This arrangement enables a legacy device to be\n\n10\n\napplying said ripple compensating signal to said passive out\n\nupdated by simple connection of the compensator circuit to\n\nput component to thereby reduce a ripple signal comprising\n\nthe regulator of the legacy device.\n\nIn a second main aspect of the invention, there is provided\n\nsaid difference between the level of the reference signal and\n\nthe sensed output signal to provide a compensated output\n\na regulator. The regulator comprises a power conversion\n\nsignal for the regulator, wherein a compensator circuit for\n\nstage, and a controller circuit having means for sensing an\n\n15\n\ngenerating the ripple compensating signal does not have to\n\noutput signal of the regulator and comparing it to a reference\n\nprocess a whole of an output load power of the regulator.\n\nsignal of the regulator to generate a control signal for con\n\nOne advantage of this arrangement is that a compensator\n\ntrolling the power conversion stage so as to regulate the out\n\ncircuit for generating the compensating signal does not have\n\nput signal of the regulator to converge to a level of the refer\n\nence signal. The regulator also comprises a compensator\n\nto process the whole of the output load power of the regulator.\n\nPreferably, the step of generating the compensating signal\n\ncircuit having means for sensing an output signal at a passive\n\ncomponent at the output of the regulator, means for generat\n\nincludes amplifying the difference signal.
