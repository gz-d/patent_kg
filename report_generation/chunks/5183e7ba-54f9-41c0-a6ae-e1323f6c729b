Up to 8.5 percent of the entire human proteome was predicted to have RNA binding properties, further demonstrating the multiple functions of IncRNA in various biological events. Mutations in IncRNA transcripts or changes in the abundance of IncRNA may alter their asso- ciated proteome, leading to health problems. The identifi- cation of IncRNA-related proteins will reveal the molecular mechanisms of the cell function in complex human diseases.\n\n[0006] Although there is a growing recognition of the functional importance of RBP, there are significant technical limitations in elucidating IncRNA-protein interactions in living cells at present. Current methods depend mainly on chemical or UV mediated cross-linking between RNA and. protein molecules to achieve effective enrichment and sepa- ration for the complex. Such procedures may produce non- systematic biases in physiological situations and mask the interaction proteins.\n\nal.\n\n[0007] Recently, Ramanathan, M. et developed a RaPID method that integrates the promiscuous but efficient biotin ligase BASU with a AN peptide navigation system that recognizes the stem-loop of RNA BoxB. Compared with other biotin ligase variants, BASU remains inactive until it is rapidly activated by the high concentration of\n\nfor\n\nNov. 4, 2021", "type": "Document"}}
