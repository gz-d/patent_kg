In order to avoid the sudden break of the GFRP bars, the beam was designed to be slightly over-reinforced (i.e. the tensile resistance of the beam was slightly higher than the compression resistance of the con- crete at a cross-section). The overall dimensions and tension reinforcement of the compression yielding beams 200 were identical to that of the reference beam 100, shown in FIG. 36. Sufficient stirrups 19 were used in both the reference beam 100 and the compression yielding beam 200 to avoid a shear failure. More specifically, reference beam 100 utilized 2 R12 steel bars as reinforcement bars 18d and R-12 links at 100 c/c as reinforcement links 22 (See FIG. 3a). Reference beams 200 utilized 2 T20 steel bars as reinforcement bars 185; 2T16 steel bars bars R-12 links at 100 c/c reinforcement\n\nby Op bp Hes Salty\n\nSubstituting Eg. 9 into Eg. 8 yeilds\n\nAy 4D-(ue-) (10) by ( \u5f15 L-2 2 He=1+\n\nEquation 10 relates the ductility demand of the compres- sion yielding zone to the required ductility factor lp of the beam.
