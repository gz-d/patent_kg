When the hydrophobic C-PVDF nanofibers layer is facing upward and the droplet touches the surface, the droplet will be subjected to the upward hydrophobic force (FS) and the downward hydrostatic pressure (FH). The FH is directly proportional to the height and mass of the droplet. As the droplet increases in size and time, the FH will break through the water transfer barrier force because of the FS of the C-PVDF nanofibers. The water will be trapped by the hydrophobic pores and come to contact the underlying superhydrophilic nanofibers. After that, the droplet will be exposed to strong capillary force (Fc, see the below Eq. 1) in all directions except upward, which is generated by the Laplace\n\npressure.\n\n2 g 1 Fox 27d 0\n\nUS 2024/0260899 Al\n\nwhere r, y, and 6 are the pore radius, the liquid surface tension, and the liquid contact angle, respectively.\n\n[0090]\n\nObviously, Fe is inversely proportional to the pore\n\nsize, demonstrating that the gradient porous structure plays an important role in the water transport process. The decreased pore size of the PAN nanofibers resulted in the increase in the Fe in both the vertical and the horizontal directions. The Fe will continually pull water into the internal superhydrophilic nanofibers layer through numer- ous pores of the C-PVDF nanofibers. And then the F, will reverse and further facilitate the downward transfer of water droplets. Finally, the liquid will drip from the superhydro- philic PAN nanofibers (FIG. 2E). When the DMWES is reversed, the droplet will be subjected to the strong capillary force Fe of the PAN nanofibers from every direction except upward until the superhydrophilic nanofibers are fully wet- ted. The lower hydrophobic C-PVDF nanofibers substrate will then exert an upward F, on the contacted liquid to\n\nprevent the liquid from dripping (FIG. 2F).", "type": "Document"}}
