The DoME enhances the FO component. The enhancement weight of the DoME is cor- responding to the hearing profile.\n\nA\n\n14 Claims, 7 Drawing Sheets\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nOct. 4, 2022\n\nSheet 1 of 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\nFIG. 1\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nOct. 4, 2022\n\nSheet 2 of 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\nExtracting a dominant melody (DoME) Processing the audio signal based on a hearing profile 312 Output another audio signal Provide the processed audio signal to user\n\nFIG. 2\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nOct. 4, 2022\n\nSheet 3 of 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\nDetermining a hearing profile of a user of a hearing device S21\n\nProcessing audio signals\n\nbased on a hearing profile obtained from the user\n\nProviding the processed audio signals to the user via an acoustic device or signal outpu4\n\nFIG. 3\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nOct. 4, 2022\n\nSheet 4 of 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\nAudio (music) source User-Calibrated Signal Processing Digital-to-Analog Converter Loudspeaker\n\nFIG. 4\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nOct. 4, 2022\n\nSheet 5 of 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\nFIG. 5\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nOct. 4, 2022\n\nSheet 6 of 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\nFIG. 6\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nOct. 4, 2022\n\nSheet 7 of 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\nIm fo)\n\n202 Processor Input Device Communication 206 Device\n\n210\n\nFIG. 7\n\nUS 11,463,829 B2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAPPARATUS AND METHOD OF PROCESSING AUDIO SIGNALS\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThe present application claims priority from U.S. Provi- sional Patent Application No. 63/039,586 filed Jun. 16, 2020, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.", "type": "Document"}}
