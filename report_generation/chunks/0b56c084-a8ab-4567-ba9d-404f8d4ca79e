Thus, various changes and modi- fications may be made without departing from the spirit and. scope of the disclosure. For instance, various components may be repositioned as desired. Features from any of the described embodiments may be combined with each other and/or an apparatus may comprise one, more, or all of the features of the above described embodiments. Moreover, not all of the features, aspects and advantages are necessarily required to practice the present disclosure. Accordingly, the scope of the present disclosure is intended to be defined only by the claims that follow.\n\n[0193] The various configurations or embodiments described are exemplary configurations only. Any one or more features from any of the configurations may be used in combination with any one or more features from any of the other configurations.\n\n[0184] The thermoelectric device 100, 200, 700 as described are advantageous because they all provide a self contained device without requiring an external power source. Further the devices are formed of a flexible material that allows the device to be mounted on a limb or about other elements e.g. pipes etc.\n\n1.
