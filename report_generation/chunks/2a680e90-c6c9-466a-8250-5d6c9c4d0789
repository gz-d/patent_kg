Compared to other existing com- munication technologies which require extra hardware (an- tennas, radio-signal generators, oscillators, etc.), the appa- ratus provided by the present invention is simpler and can be integrated into a single component.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nDue to growing energy demand and further integration of photovoltaics into buildings, vehicles, infrastructure (roads), etc., it can be fairly predicted that photovoltaic devices will become ubiquitous in upcoming decades. Despite the fore- seen omnipresence of these devices, they are considered as passive energy generators, as their maximum power output is determined by available sunlight, which depends on environmental conditions.\n\n25\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nEmbodiments of the invention are described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings, in which: G. 1 shows how a regular implementation of photovol- taic system for transforming sunlight into electrical current; FIG. 2 shows a detailed view of an internal structure of the photovoltaic module in normal operation; \u53ef", "type": "Document"}}
