This number is both incon- venient to users and eventually leads to electronic waste prob- lems. Inductive or wireless charging apparatus that can charge more than one electronic product have been proposed. Two different approaches have been proposed for the ac mag- netic flux generation, namely \u201chorizontal flux\u201d and \u201cvertical flux\u201d method.\n\nInductive electronic chargers have been developed for use with some types of portable electronic equipment such as electric toothbrushes. Inductive chargers have also been pro- posed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,356,049, 6,301,128, and 6,118,249. These inductive type chargers, however, use traditional trans- ormer designs with windings wound around ferrite magnetic cores. The main magnetic flux between the primary (energy- transmitting) winding and secondary (energy-receiving) winding has to go through the magnetic core materials. An alternative contactless charger [Chang-Gyun Kim; Dong- Hyun Seo; Jung-Sik You; Jong-Hu Park; Cho, B. H., \u201cDesign of a contactless battery charger for cellular phone,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Volume: 48, Issue: 6, December 2001 Page(s): 1238-1247.] proposed also uses magnetic cores as the main structure for the coupled trans- ormer windings. However, these battery chargers do not use a planar structure and each charger is able to charge only one", "type": "Document"}}
