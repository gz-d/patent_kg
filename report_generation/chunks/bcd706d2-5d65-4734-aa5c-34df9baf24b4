The equivalent AC lumped circuit in this example has a T-embedding-based oscillator topol- ogy. In this example, the coupling network can be consid- ered as part of the oscillator. In FIG. 5, the gate inductor is separated for out-of-phase strong coupling horizontally and the source capacitor is separated for weak coupling verti- cally.\n\n[0168] In some embodiments, to improve the conversion efficiency, the harmonic oscillator is purposely designed to optimize the third harmonic output power. Inventors of the present invention have realized that high-efficiency terahertz harmonic oscillator design generally includes three aspects: 1) determination of the transistor operation state to maxi- mize the desired harmonic output current; 2) oscillator synthesis satisfying the obtained condition; and 3) proper matching at the desired harmonic.\n\n[0169] In the following, the nonlinear operation of a transistor is studied to optimize third harmonic generation. By understanding the third harmonic current generation mechanism in a transistor, the operation conditions for a transistor to increase the third harmonic output can be determined.\n\nthe\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n11\n\n[0170] FIG. 6 shows an example simulation setup studying nonlinear behavior of a transistor.
