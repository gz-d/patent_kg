The output charge measured from TIDE-G (in red) is ~ 59 nC, which is ~/760 folds higher than that of the TENG device (please see right portion of the figure).\n\nin\n\nFIGS.\n\n8a to 8d include a photographic image, schematic diagrams and graphs concerning a control experiment performed based on TENG in which:\n\nFIG. 8a is an optical image showing the as-fabricated TENG device.\n\nFIG. 8b is a schematic drawing showing detailed working mechanism of the device. FIG 8c is a graph showing variation of voltage output from TENG as a result of continuous droplet impinging. Inset shows the time-dependent variation of voltage generated from a single droplet impinging.\n\nFIG. 8d is a graph showing, for each test, the amount of transferred charges in TENG (upper Curve) is measured to be identical with the charges carried by the departing droplets (lower curve), confirming that the electricity generation from the TENG indeed originates from the contact electrification effect.\n\nFIG 9 is a graph showing electrical outputs of TIDE-G as a function of load resistance. With the load resistance increase from 1 KQ to 100 MQ, the output voltage was measured to vary from 0.45 to 170 V and the output current decreased from 410 HA to 1.55 WA. When a load resistance was 33.2 KO, the maximum output power-density was 69.8 W/m*.\n\nV\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\nFIG. 10 is a graph showing stability of the charges on PTFE under various humidity; in which when kept under a humidity of 40 RH% for 30 days, the charges on PTFE are still quite stable and there IS NO pronounced decay.
