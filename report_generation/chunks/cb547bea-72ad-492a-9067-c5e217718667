This can lead to skin discomfort and poten- tial inflammation. In the context of large-scale practical applications of electronic skins, factors such as versatility, wearable comfort, and energy-saving performance are cru- cial.\n\n[0006] MxXene, a novel 2D material derived from the chemical exfoliation of bulk MAX crystalline structures, has garnered attention. Represented by the formula M,,,,X,,Tx (n=1, 2, or 3), where M denotes transition metals (e.g., Ti, Cr, and V), X denotes carbon and/or nitrogen, and Tx\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nrepresents surface functional groups (hydroxyl, oxygen, or\n\nfluorine terminals), MXene exhibits excellent metallic con- ductivity, thermal conductivity, and a high surface area. Various electronic skins composed of Ti,;C,Tx and their hybrids have been designed to achieve piezoresistive sens- ing properties, including low detection limits, high sensitiv- ity, and long stability. Challenges arise, however, due to the exceptionally high conductivity and interlayer restacking resulting from hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces, leading to minimal changes in the conductive path under low pressure and low sensitivity. Furthermore, the low mechani- cal strength compromises long-term deformation and struc- tural integrity under high pressure. Recent efforts have focused on constructing stable interfaces in different MXene-based hybrid nano-/micro-structures through the design of heterogeneous interface interactions. Neverthe- less, traditional electronic skins and biosensors based on MXenes are typically fabricated using airproof composite membranes, potentially resulting in uncomfortable wear,\n\nmicroorganism breeding, and skin inflammation.", "type": "Document"}}
