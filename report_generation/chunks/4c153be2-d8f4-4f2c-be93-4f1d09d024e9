The angle between the x,,-axis of the local coordinate system L1 (i.e., phase progression of Metalens #1) and x-axis of the global coordinate system G is denoted as 1p,. Similarly, the angle between x,,-axis of the local coordinate system L2 and x-axis is denoted as wp. Chang- ing the values of wy, and a, corresponds to a physical rotation of Metalenses #1 and #2, respectively. (r, :) are the radial and angular coordinates of the focal position with respect to the global coordinate system. The relationships among the azimuth angles satisfy:\n\n_fitte 4\n\n0\n\nDec. 9, 2021\n\n-continued\n\nWa yal\n\nG)\n\n2\n\nwhere a is the angle between the radial direction of the focus point and the x, ,-axis or x,,-axis. Without loss of generality, here we consider the scenario that the focus of Metalens #2 steers radially along the y,,-axis since the 2D focus steering can be achieved by co-rotation of the metalens doublet. Metalens #2 is synthesized by considering the required phase retardation profiles for multiple focusing cases. For each focusing case, the required phase retardation profile can be computed by\n\n2 \u4e00 \u4e00 7 4 gs \u82af Vc- Moose)? + (y \u2014rOsina? + fF \u4e00 \u9084 CO, \u5916 9", "type": "Document"}}
