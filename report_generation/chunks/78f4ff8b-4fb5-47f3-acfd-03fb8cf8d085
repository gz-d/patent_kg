It is to be noted that the sufficient charges on PTFE can be achieved by continuous droplet impinging. Fig. 1a plots the variation of the output voltage measured from an Individual impinging droplet as a function of the number of droplet impinging. The Qmax and the output voltage increase gradually with increasing of droplet impinging times, followed by reaching an eventual plateau with the charge and voltage stabilized at 50.2 nC and 143.5 V, respectively, after impinging of 1.6x10* times (see Fig 1c). Furthermore, this charge-loading method is applicable to a wide range of thickness of PTFE film. Our result shows that the maximum transferred charges are comparable after water droplet\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\n1/\n\nimpinging of same times (1.6*10*) with various thickness of PTFE film from 6.7 um to 16.9 um (see Fig. 4b). It is noted that the voltage linearly increases with thickness of PTFE film, which agree well with the tendency predicting by the circuit model (see Fig. 5c).\n\nComparison with conventional TENG\n\nTo\n\nillustrate the unique advantage of our transistor-like design, we\n\nalso characterized\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20", "type": "Document"}}
