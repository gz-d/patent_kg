Furthermore, by fitting the measured current against the concentrations of the antigen as shown in FIG. 7B, the detection limit and the sensitivity of the detector are determined. In this example, the detection limit is determined to be 4 UmL~! whereas the sensitivity is determined to be 0.384895 wAU~! mLcm -2. With such selectivity and sensitivity, a blood sample may be directly applied to the detector for analysis without any extra extraction processes that may cause loss of sample.\n\n[0078] In operation, an O-ring 610 is placed within the chamber for preventing solution leakage from any gaps between the two portions (602A, 602B). Referring to FIG. 6D, the O-ring may be placed in a recess surrounding an opening of one of the individual compartments. Preferably, the O-ring is placed in the recess surrounding the opening of the compartment 606A, which is arranged to retain a refer- ence solution. In this way, when the two portions (602A, 602B) are screwed together, any gaps between the openings of the compartment 606A and the compartment 606B is sealed from the outside, thereby minimizing the chance of solution leakage from these compartments.\n\n[0083] The electrochemical detector of the present inven- tion is advantageous in that it may be implemented in portable electronic devices and hand-held sensors which may be used in domestic applications so as to provide a point-of-care service to the patients. The low-voltage (2V) operation of the electrochemical apparatus ensures chemical stability (no induced electrolysis) of analyte solutions.", "type": "Document"}}
