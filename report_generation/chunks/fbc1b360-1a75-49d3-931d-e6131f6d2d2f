When the cache is turned on, the data in DDR needs to be flushed into the cache. Otherwise, it will cause an inconsistent problem. Due to the time difference of the software execution, all the time indices are the average of 1000 measurements. The speedup is the ratio of the SW time to SW/HW time, which indicates the improvement of the software/hardware acceleration over the pure software.\n\n[0120] In addition, the pure software with cache turn on has around 12-18 times speedup when compared with the cache turn off time. However, the performance improvement of cache is not significant when compared on the SW/HW time. This is because the cache could significantly accelerate the software operation but has almost no effect on the hardware operation, and the portion of software operation in the software/hardware co-design system is very low. When the cache is on, data flush functions are required, so this\n\nware co-design were evaluated and comparted. The trans- mission interface is configured according to the parameters of Dilithium. Moreover, the hardware accelerator is designed to be fully parameter configurable; there is no need to modify the hardware design and transmission interface to adapt different security levels. The Dilithium algorithms are tested 1000-times and the average running time is recorded. in FIGS. 7A and 7B. The speedup of software-hardware co-design to pure software is calculated accordingly and. illustrated in FIG. 8. In FIGS. 7 and 8, K refers to Key generation, S refers to Sign, V refers to Verify, and 2, 3, and. 5 are the corresponding NIST security levels.", "type": "Document"}}
