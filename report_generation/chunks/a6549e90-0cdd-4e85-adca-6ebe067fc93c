The patch may be arranged centrally of the substrate assembly. The microstrip line network may include a first microstrip line for connection with a first probe or connector, and the patch is operably connected with the ground plane and with the first microstrip line.\n\nthere is provided a dielectric resonator antenna having a dielectric resonator element and a substrate assembly attached to the dielectric resonator element. The substrate assembly comprising a feeding network arranged to: feed the dielectric resonator element to produce (or receive) a first linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern at a first resonant mode; and feed the dielectric resonator ele- ment to produce (or receive) a second linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern at a second resonant mode different from the first resonant mode. The antenna can be used as a signal transmitter, a signal receiver, or a signal transceiver. The substrate assembly may be removably attached to the dielectric resonator element.
