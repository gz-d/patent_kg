Hence, it is not necessary to give specific dimen- sions and measurements here. It suffices to state that, if the frame 1601 is used to divide the ice slab for infusion with the afore-described curcumin solution, then each cell 1605 preferably has dimensions that define areas of about 200 mm? each on the surface of the ice slab 1603, such that a volume of 50 pl to 150 yl of the solution can be applied to onto each of the areas, where the concentration of the drug, such as curcumin, in the solution is 1 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml.\n\n[0075] After the drug solution has been infused into the ice, the frame 1601 can be removed before ventilation is applied to remove the solvent. As the surface of the ice slab 1603 without the frame 1601 has no obstruction to flow of air, this embodiment provides that it is easier to remove the solvent from the ice by ventilation.\n\nAn advantage of using the frame 1601 is that space more economically used; the cells 1605 defined by the frame 1601 are not separated from each other by a distance, unlike the wells 103 in the microplate 101, as shown in FIG. 1. That is, the ells 1605 defined in the frame 1601 are even more compactly arranged that the wells 103 in the micro- plate 101.\n\n[0076] is\n\n[0077] Optionally, the frame 1601 can be submerged slightly into a tray of water, and remains in the water as the water is flash frozen. In this way, any part of the frame 1601 that is protruding from the surface of the ice acts like the well in the microplate embodiment of FIG. 1 (not illus- trated).", "type": "Document"}}
