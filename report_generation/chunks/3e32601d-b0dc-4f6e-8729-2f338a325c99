To simulate the EDL formation process when water droplet contacting with the as-fabricated device, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out in this work. TIP4P/ICE*? water model is employed, which is a popular water model in the theoretical studies on water. Various properties of water, e.g. melting point, density, and phase diagram etc., have been success- fully reproduced by using TIP4P/ICE. Because TIP4P/ICE is a rigid model, we introduced the sodium ions and chlorine ions with identical amount into water to study charges movement. The MD system includes 40000 water molecules with 808 Na* and 808 CI being dissolved in water. To mimic the experimental setup, rigid and smooth hydropho- bic atomic layers are used to represent the PTFE and electrode, respectively. 800 negative and 800 positive charges were fixed with spacing of 8.7 A, respectively, on the atomic layers of PTFE and electrode, and each site was charged +e, as depicted in Extended Data FIG. 14. Water molecules with dissolved Na* and Cl ions were initially equilibrated for 3 ns of MD simulations at 300 K without any charge on the substrates. Then, 5 ns MD simulations in\n\nComparison with Conventional TENG", "type": "Document"}}
