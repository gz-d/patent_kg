In some implementations, the sensor component 406 can comprise a cell component 408 that can include one ormore solar cells (e.g., photovoltaic cells) that can receive or detect light, including optical signals, from visual images presented in a control region of a projector screen component associated with the barrier control component 400. The one or more solar cells of the cell component 408 can convert detected light energy into electrical energy, for example, through a photovoltaic effect process, or indirectly by first converting the light energy into heat energy and converting the heat energy to electrical energy. The cell component 408 can include other electronic circuitry that can be used to transfer power generated by the cell component 408 to other components, such as, for example, other components of the barrier control component 400, an associated barrier compo-", "type": "Document"}}
