How- ever, such solutions increase transmission effectiveness at the expense of reducing the effective illumination area for solar energy production. In other proposals, solutions have focused on integrating a meshed patch antenna on solar cells or on placing a folded photovoltaic cell, which also functions as an antenna, in the focal line of a parabolic trough. In yet other solutions, a dual function transparent dielectric resonator antenna that additionally serves as a focusing lens for a solar cell panel has been proposed.\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\nThe subject disclosure relates to solar energy and commu- nications, and more particularly to enhanced devices, sys- tems, and methodologies for solar energy collection and use communications systems.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nConventionally in modern wireless systems, antennas are used to receive and transmit microwave signals. Typically, such systems are powered by local electrical grid connections and are connected to backup power systems such as battery banks, emergency diesel generators, and so on. However, such systems merely rely on conventional power systems that, at the source, derive energy from non-renewable fossil fuels.\n\nIn addition, for developing nations, expansion of wireless markets can face unique challenges. For example, in devel- oping nations, traditional power infrastructures may or may not be available. For instance, due to topographical or other challenges, a conventional power grid can be rendered eco- nomically infeasible, which in turn, can prevent establish- ment of wireless communication systems.", "type": "Document"}}
