The deep brain stimulation at the deep cerebellar nuclei helps the subject to improve his/her motor movement and minimize the risk of getting injured as a result of ataxia. The present invention may also be useful in rehabilitation and other medical purposes.\n\n[0010] In an embodiment, the processor includes a field- programmable gate array.", "type": "Document"}}
