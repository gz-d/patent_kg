In the case of the combined DRA and optical component module 315a, the DRA acts as a signal radiator, i.e. antenna, for the transmit chain 320. The optical compo- nent may comprise a solar cell for generating power for the electronic system 300 or a lamp or LED for generating a light output signal for the system 300. In the former case, the DRA comprises a DR according to the invention as depicted by FIG. 1 or 2 and, in the latter case, the DRA comprises a DR according to the invention as depicted by FIG. 14 as herein- after described.\n\nis very compact for the solar cell does not need any extra footprint. The second configuration that uses a transparent rectangular DR 16 is more suitable for applications that do not want the focusing effect.", "type": "Document"}}
