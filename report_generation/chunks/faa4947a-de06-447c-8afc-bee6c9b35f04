The processor component 526 can employ one or more processors, microprocessors, or controllers that can process data, including control signals relating to video content being presented by an associated projector screen component, video content, audio content, mapping information relating the control signals, type of video content and/or types/modes of barrier patterns, data relating to parameters associated with the barrier component 500 and associated components, etc., to facilitate identifying a desired display mode, barrier pattern and/or barrier pattern mode to employ in relation to process- ing video content received from the projector screen compo- nent. The processor component 526 also can control data flow between the barrier component 500 and other components associated with the barrier component 500.", "type": "Document"}}
