A sec- ond reagent such as concentrated sodium hydroxide so- lution may be used to enhance the yield of -OH functional groups. For those metallic surfaces with -OH functional groups after pressurized hydrogen peroxide treatment, the antibacterial/antimicrobial peptides are able to cov- alently attach to the -OH groups on the titanium alloy substrate surface by applying coupling agents (linkers). For instance, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) can be used as one of the coupling agents. One end of the APTES linker can be attached to the -OH group on the titanium alloy substrate surface and the other end with a primary amine group can be linked up with other linkers and/or antibacterial/antimicrobial peptides. The amine group at the APTES linker can be easily converted into other functional groups such as COOH by various chem- ical reactions such as oxidation and carbonation. [0040] Figs. 8A-8C illustrate the attachment of an an- tibacterial/antimicrobial peptide to the titanium alloy in which its surface is firstly treated with pressurized hydro- thermal treatment and followed by the attachment of AP- TES linkers and glutaric anhydride. The antibacterial/an- timicrobial peptide can be subsequently incorporated to the free end of the APTES linker or glutaric anhydride. Fig. 8A shows the chemical structure of the embodiment of an antibacterial/antimicrobial peptide immobilized on a titanium alloy implant surface. Figs. 8B and 8C show the chemical structure of APTES molecule and antibac- terial peptide, respectively. [0041] During the fabrication process, particular grids (or masks) can be applied to cover partial areas of the substrate so as to establish various patterns over the metallic substrate surface, thereby forming specific pat- terns of antibacterial/antimicrobial peptides and surfaces on the titanium alloy as shown in Fig. 9.
