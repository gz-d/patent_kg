The meta- surface structure 102 includes multiple subwavelength units (e.g., meta-atoms, labeled as \u201cU\u201d) operable to manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves for radiation. Depend- ing on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may manipulate or control one, or two, or three, or four, or all of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum). The metasurface structure 102 may be operably connected with a controller 10. The con- troller 10 may provide control signals to the metasurface\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nstructure 102 to facilitate the manipulation or control ampli- tude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves by the metasurface structure 102.\n\n[0108] In some embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 or the subwavelength units can selectively manipulate or control amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and/or momentum of electromagnetic waves. Depending on embodiments, the metasurface structure 102 may selectively manipulate or control one, or two, or three, or four of the five listed properties (amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and momentum) at a time.", "type": "Document"}}
