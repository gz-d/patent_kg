This assay was applied to determine the antiviral effect of alka- loids against various viral infections, which is described in detail below.\n\nFomnula (1)\n\nDetermination of the Role of Ca\u00ae* Signaling in Viral Infection\n\n[0076] extracellular Ca \u4eba affects ZIKV infection of host cells by performing ZIKV H+RNA hybridization and anti-ZIKV envelope protein immunostaining. As shown in FIG. 1D, ZIKV +RNA was detectable inside host cells after 90 minutes of viral infection in the presence of extracellular Ca**, whereas no positive viral RNA was detected in host cells after 90 minutes of the viral infection in the absence of extracellular Ca?*. Moreover, in the host cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, intact virirons (staining with ZIKV envelope proteins) were detected in the plasma membrane of host cells as shown in the right panel of FIG. 1D. These results suggest that Ca2+ influx is required for flavivirus\n\n[0073]\n\nThe inventors established an assay for detecting\n\nization can be applied to measure viral RNA replication.
