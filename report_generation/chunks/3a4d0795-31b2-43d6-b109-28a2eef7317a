With reference to FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C, it was unexpectedly found that the four single mutants showed improved specificity of varied levels at a canonical PAM (EMX1_6), a known promiscuous (VEGFA_8) site and a non-canonical PAM (EMX1_1) site. As seen in FIG. 2A, the N413A mutant showed significantly higher specificity at EMX1_6 site compared to VVT (wildtype). As shown in FIG. 2D, the R245A mutant nearly halved the number of off-target sites at both of the canonical PAM sites, improved on- to off-target read ratio and retained a comparable number of on-target reads (70%, 98% and 84%, respectively, at the three sites) when compared to WT-SaCas9. The other three single mutants, i.e. N413A, N419A, and R654A improved on- to off-target ratio across the three sites.", "type": "Document"}}
