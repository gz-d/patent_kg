The method comprises providing an output compensator circuit having an input for receiving the reference signal from the regulator, an input for receiving the sensed output signal of the regulator, within the compen- sator circuit, generating a ripple compensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference signal comprising a difference between a level of the reference signal for the regulator and the sensed output signal, and connecting an output of the compensator circuit to a passive component at the output of the regulator in order to apply the ripple com- pensating signal to the passive component to thereby reduce aripple signal comprising the difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal, the com- pensator circuit being configured such that the compensator circuit does not have to process a whole of an output load\n\nGS. 7a to 7c show the equivalent circuits for the example G. 6;\n\nG. 8 shows the small signal model of the example of\n\nG. 9 illustrates in more detail the typical switched type voltage regulator circuit of FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 10 illustrates how the circuit of the typical switched type voltage regulator circuit of FIG. 9 is modified to connect dynamic output compensator circuit according to the inven- tion;\n\nFIGS. 11a to 11e illustrate how a regulator according to invention minus the compensator circuit (FIG. 11d) is com- bined with or connected to a compensator circuit according invention (FIG. 11e);", "type": "Document"}}
