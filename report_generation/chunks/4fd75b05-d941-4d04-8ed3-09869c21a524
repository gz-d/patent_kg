The developed AfBP probe KPlip is capable of capturing Klip-interacting proteins in both living cells and cell lysates. Chemical proteomics experiments with KPlip identified Sirt2 as a novel binder of a lipoylated substrate. KTlip is the first single-step fluorescent probe developed for rapid profiling of delipoylation activity. The enzymology data obtained from both KTlip and lipoylated peptides demonstrated the robust delipoylation ability of Sirt2 in vitro. The delipoylation activity of Sirt2 is far superior to that of Sirt4, the only identified mammalian delipoylating enzyme.\n\n[0097] LC-MS/MS Analysis.\n\nUpon extraction from the gel and desalting, the obtained peptides were redissolved in 12uL of 0.1% formic acid and separated by an Easy-nLC 1200 system coupled to a QEx- active HF (Thermo Scientific). A 5 hL amount of peptide was injected and separated on a reverse phase C18 column (75 umxls cm) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. Mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile in ultrapure water)\n\n[0092] With the chemical probes of the present invention the novel function of Sirt2 has been proven to remove the lipoyl group with high catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, it was also shown that Sirt2 could effectively catalyze DLAT delipoylation and downregulate PDH activity in cells. This suggested that sirtuins might play a complex role in the\n\n[0090]\n\nAn\n\nexperiment\n\nwas\n\nperformed\n\nto\n\ndetermine\n\nyse DLAT delipoylation and modulate PDH activity in cells.\n\ndynamic\n\nof PDH\n\ndifferent\n\nPromega.\n\nDec. 23 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0395795 A1\n\n9\n\nwere used to establish a linear gradient of 7-25 % mobile\n\nnight .
