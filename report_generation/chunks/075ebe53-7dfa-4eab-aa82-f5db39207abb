More spe- cifically, the present invention relates to platinum-based anti-cancer chemotherapy drugs and anti-infection drugs.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Platinum-based anticancer drugs are the most widely used chemotherapy agents in current clinical prac- tice. It is estimated that more than 50% of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are treated with platinum drugs alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs. The therapeutic outcome of platinum drugs, however, is often limited by the serious side effects and drug resistance of cancer cells. For example, current chemotherapeutic agents may be activated in non-pathological tissue.\n\n[0003] While certain specific cytotoxic platinum com- plexes are also known for medical use (see, for example, US 2018/155382 Al, to Zhu, et. al., assigned to City University of Hong Kong, published on Jun. 7, 2018, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference), additional com- plexes are desirable.", "type": "Document"}}
