FIG. 7A illustrates immunofluorescence\n\n[0099] images Lamin A/C expressions for nuclei in NPC43 and NP460 cells (unextracted nuclei) and the chemically extracted nuclei of NPC43 and NP460 cells. Possible causes of reduced moduli for the extracted nuclei are examined using immunofluorescence staining (see description about \u201cFluo- rescence Staining\u201d below in the \u201csupplementary informa- tion\u201d for further details) for the nuclear Lamin A/C expres- sions, as it is known for its contribution to nuclear deformability and direct relations with nuclear elasticity. To make the staining images comparable for different cases, parameters (e.g. cell density before staining, incident laser intensity in imaging etc.) used in immunofluorescence stain- ing and confocal microscopy imaging are controlled. The stained fluorescence intensity for unextracted and extracted nuclei are quantified based on the captured microscopic\n\nimages.\n\n[0100] FIG. 7B illustrates a bar graph showing the total fluorescence intensity of the unextracted and extracted nuclei. It is shown that the extracted nuclei have signifi- cantly lower Lamin A/C expression, suggesting that the nuclear extraction process may reduce the nuclear mem- brane integrity and the corresponding stiffness. The Lamin A/C expression of nuclei of NPC43 (1.36x105+SE 0.22x 105 A.U) is lower than Lamin A/C expression of nuclei in NP460 (1.89x105+SE 0.26105 A.U.), corresponding with the measured nuclear moduli. Accordingly, the non-destruc- tive quantification procedure in the example embodiments provides more accurate results for quantifying mechanical properties of cells.\n\nCell Classification", "type": "Document"}}
