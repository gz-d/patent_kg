For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 14a and b, a light source 414 (e.g.,an LED or lamp) can be placed inside a hollow region 423 of trans- parent DR 416 on a circuit 410 to give a lamp that also works as an antenna. This embodiment of a light generating optical component (lamp or LED) located within a DRA or even component other than an antenna shares similarities with the circuits 10, 110 of FIGS. 1 and 2 and thus like numerals preceded by a \u201c4\u201d are used to denote like parts.", "type": "Document"}}
