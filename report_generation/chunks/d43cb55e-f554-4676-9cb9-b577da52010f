The compensator circuit computes the difference between Vo and Vref with the sub- tractor formed by Al, R1, R2, R3, R4. After filtering the high-frequency noise by the low-pass filter formed by Rlp and Clp, the output goes to the input ofa voltage amplifier formed. by A3, aclass AB amplifier, and the feedback resistors R5 and. R6. The voltage amplifier injects required voltage Vcomp at Node B to compensate the difference between Vo and Vref. Meanwhile, Vo is subtracted from Vcomp by using the sub- tractor formed by A2, R7, R8, RY, and R10, to give the output Vo' at Node D. If no compensation is needed, Vcomp is zero\n\nFurthermore, FIGS. 11 to 14 provide at least a compensator circuit for a voltage regulator comprising: an input for receiv- ing a reference voltage signal from the voltage regulator; an input for receiving a sensed output voltage signal of the volt- age regulator; a signal generating circuit for generating a compensating signal based on a difference signal, said differ- ence signal comprising a difference between a level of the reference voltage signal for the voltage regulator and the sensed output voltage signal; and an output for connecting to a passive component at the output of said voltage regulator in\n\nFIGS. 11a to 1le represent a physical example of the voltage regulator of the invention that has been subjected to experimentation.
