The dashed line denotes maximum E of PDMS when fully cured at high temperature. Note that temperature plays the dominating role, leaving wide time windows for opera- tion.\n\n[0017] In one embodiment of the present invention, curing temperature and the curing time of the elastomer mold during the first phase is at 22 to 25\u00b0 C. for 24 hours.\n\n[0018] In one embodiment of the present invention, the elastomer mold is cured by baking at 150\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes during the second phase, and the temperature gradually rises from room temperature at a rate of 10\u00b0 C. per minute during baking process.\n\n[0029] FIG. 1C shows SEM images of the elastic crack formation in PDMS (Phase J) being pulled out from an array closed loops with diverse directions which is showed inset.\n\n[0019] In one embodiment of the present invention, the elastomer mold is cured by baking at 250\u00b0 C. for 1 hour during the second phase, and the temperature gradually rises from room temperature at a rate of 10\u00b0 C. per minute during baking process.\n\n[0030] FIG. 1D shows SEM image showing the process separating PDMS (Phase II) from the closed-loop replica. The elastic crack self-sealed during molding and intact closed-loop replicas were obtained.\n\n[0020] Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically described.", "type": "Document"}}
