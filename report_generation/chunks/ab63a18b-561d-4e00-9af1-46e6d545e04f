The correction device 1 can comprise first and second support members 10a and 104, such as \u201cC\u201d or \u201cS\u201d shaped supporting rods 12a and 12b. The support members 10a and 10 can be similarly disposed in various positions in relation to the deformed spine 2. In one exemplary embodiment, one or both of the first and second support members 10a and 10 can be longitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the vertebrae. The support members 10a and 106 can be secured onto the spine 2 through various securing elements, such as hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the upper ends 16a and 164 of the support members 10a and 104 can be fixed to each other and an upper vertebra 6 through wires, hooks, screws, clamps, and the like. In another exemplary embodiment, the first and second support members 10a and 104 can be secured to different upper and/or lower vertebrae\n\nan embodiment, as 2, one or more anchor members 30 can be in the form of transverse traction members 32. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more transverse traction members 32 can be connected between the support member 11 and one or more vertebrae of the spine 2 via another anchor member 30. The traction members 32 can be in various forms and capable of providing a constant or substantially constant transverse traction force. In an exem- plary embodiment, the traction member 32 is capable of reinforcing or reducing the correction force provided by the support member 10. In another exemplary embodiment, the transverse traction member 32 is capable of independently correcting spinal deformities. Exemplary transverse traction members 32 can include, but are not limited to, superelastic spring members, adjustable cylinders, internal motors, gear and the like.", "type": "Document"}}
