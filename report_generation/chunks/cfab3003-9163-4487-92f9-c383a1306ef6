The results showed a main effect amount of fixations, F(1.356, 29.840) = 30.778, p < 0.001, Np = 0.583, and an interaction between amount of fixations and group, F(1.356, 29.840) = 5.657, p =0.016, Np = 0.205. The main effect of group was not significant, F(1, 22) = 0.077, n.s. These results indicated that, shown in FIGURE 9A, group B had higher inference accuracy when a smaller amount fixations were used (75% to 90%), whereas group A had higher inference accuracy when larger amount of fixations were used. When the inference accuracies were compared against the chance-level (0.5) using /-test, it was found that when using the first 75% to 85% of the fixations, group B\u2019s inference accuracy was significantly above the chance-level, whereas group A\u2019s inference accuracy was not. When using the first 90% to 100% of the fixations, inference accuracy was significantly above the chance-level for both groups (FIGURE 9A). other words, participants ln group B revealed their biases to the preferred stimulus earlier\n\nIn\n\nthan group A.", "type": "Document"}}
