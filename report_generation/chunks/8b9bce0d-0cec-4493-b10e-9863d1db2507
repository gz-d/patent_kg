Referring to FIG. 7, when the DKO group mice were subject to DCN stimulation, the mice have decreased descent latency in the pole climb test, as compared to DKO mice without DCN stimulation. FIG. 8 shows that the DKO mice receiving DCN stimulation have an increased stride length in the walking track test, as compared to DKO mice without DCN stimulation. FIG. 9 and FIG. 10 show that the DKO mice receiving DCN stimulation have a slightly longer retention time on a rotarod spindle and decreased transverse latency in the narrow beam walking test, as compared to DKO mice without DCN stimulation.
