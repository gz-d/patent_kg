Upon the arrival of the participant, the experimenter briefly introduces the purpose and the flow of the study. The experimenter first measured the partici- pant\u2019s skin temperature around the auricular area and col- lected biographic information. He then demonstrated how to wear the earhook on the left ear and then assisted the participant to wear it. The experimenter verbally explained the nature of each stimulation to familiarize the participant with the stimuli. During the explanation, the experimenter numbered the position of the stimulus corresponding to the GUI shown on the screen FIG.3. With each thermal stimulus (hot and cold) lasting for 1.5 s, the participants were presented in a clock-wise order with the front position (P1 in FIG. 1B) of the earhook as the start. A slider on the GUI allows the participant to select the PWM values, ranging from 0 to 255, to control the intensity of the thermal stimulus. The participant could slide it freely and repeat the current stimulus until satisfied and then move to the next position. For the PWM adjustment, the participant is instructed to find the intensity that he/she feels 1s the most\n\ncomfortable and perceivable.\n\n[0062] Results and Analysis", "type": "Document"}}
