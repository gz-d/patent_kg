The transparent reso- nator may be mounted on the circuit so as to at least partially occupy a footprint of another component of the circuit. The transparent resonator may be mounted on said circuit such that it comprises a part of a light pathway for said another component so as to allow light impinging on said resonator component to reach said another component or to allow light generated by said another component to be transmitted away from said another component. In one particular embodiment a dual function transparent, shaped (preferably hemispheri- cal) DRA that simultaneously functions as an antenna and a focusing lens for a solar cell is provided. To make the system compact, the solar cell is placed beneath the DRA to save the footprint on the ground plane or grounded substrate of the DRA. The DRA can also serve as a protective cover for the solar cell. A conformal strip or feedline strip is used to excite the transparent, shaped DRA in its dominant TE,,, mode. Due to its focusing effect, the shaped DRA can increase the\n\nWith the advent of the ultrawide-band and millimeter-wave era, ithas become increasingly normal to combine microwave and optical circuits in modern communication systems. The transparent microstrip antenna has been studied for optical applications, but having a highly conducting transparent film is still a challenging problem. As the conductivity of the conductive transparent film (~5x10\u00b0 S/m) is relatively low as compared with that of metals, most of the transparent planar antennas reported thus far have an antenna gain of lesser than 0 dBi. It has been proposed to apply conductive paste to the slot edge of the transparent microstrip antenna for improving the radiation efficiency. Using this technique, the antenna gain has been increased from about -5 dBi to ~0 dBi, but at the cost of reducing the transparency of the antenna.\n\nfor\n\na\n\nfor\n\nof\n\nnot\n\nIt is also known that", "type": "Document"}}
