The method of claim 2, wherein metallic atoms of the metallic structure are oxidized to metallic ions thereby releasing from the surface of the metallic structure during oxidation.\n\n22. The method of claim 21, wherein the morphologies nanoparticles include at least one of nanocones, nanopyra- nanorods, nanowires, and nanostars.\n\n4. The method of claim 2, wherein the metallic ions are reduced to metallic atoms thereby forming the nano-struc- tured metallic layer on the surface of the metallic structure during reduction.\n\n23. The method of claim 12, further including step d) separating metallic nanoparticles from electrolyte by cen- trifugation.\n\n5. The method of claim 1, wherein the releasing of the metallic ions in step a) is carried out by applying a first voltage for a first duration to the metallic structure; and the deposition of the nano-structured metallic layer in step b) is carried out by applying a second voltage different from the first voltage for a second duration to the metallic structure obtained after step (a).\n\n24.
