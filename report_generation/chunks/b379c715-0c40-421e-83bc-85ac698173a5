Coupling agents can be silane coupling agents, such as 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethacrylate and 3-aminopropylt- rimethoxysilane (\u201cASCA\u201d). The coupling agents can modify the surface of the biodegradable metallic materials. The coupling agent can be added to a solvent together with a catalyst. The treated or untreated biodegradable metallic materials can be added to the solution mixture which is then heated under reflux with nitrogen for a period of time at a given temperature. After the silane treatment, the metallic materials can be heat treated again in a low vacuum oven at a given temperature. Tables 5 and 6 show examples of coupling agent treatment process conditions using 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethacrylate and 3-aminopropylt- timethoxysilane as the coupling agent, respectively.
