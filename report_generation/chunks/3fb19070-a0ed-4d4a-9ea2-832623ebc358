The another component may be an optical component that is arranged to generate light for transmission via the light path- way or to process light received thereat via said light pathway.\n\nIna third main aspect of the invention, there is provided an electronic device including a DRA according to the second main aspect, wherein the DRA functions as an antenna of said electronic device and wherein said DRA is positioned in said device so that the DR element is located so as to intercept light travelling along a light pathway of said device. At least a portion of the DR element may define the light pathway ofthe electronic device.\n\nThe DR element may be used as a protective cover for electronic component of the electronic device whilst allowing light traveling along said light pathway to reach said elec- tronic device.\n\nPreferably, the resonator element is shaped so as to focus light impinging on a surface thereof. Preferably, the material comprising the resonator element is transparent to light at and/or beyond optical frequencies, i.e. visible and/or invisible light frequencies. More preferably, the material of the reso- nator element comprises borosilicate glass. Preferably, the glass is borosilicate crown glass, commonly known by the tradenames \u201cPyrex\u201d or \u201cK9\u201d.", "type": "Document"}}
