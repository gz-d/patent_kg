The spectrum shows the characteristic stretching vibration of the nitrile group (C\u2014N) of PAN at 2,240 cm 1. The spectrum of C-PVDF nanofibers displays the typical in-plane bending of the \u4e00 CH group at 1.405 cm | and symmetric stretching of the \u2014CF, group at 1,170 cm 1. A wider peak shifting to a lower wavenumber at 3,450 cm of \u2014OH group indicates the possible existence of hydrogen bonds between the C-PVDF nanofibers matrix and MXene/ CNTs inks (FIG. 1F). FIG. 1G shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, performed by a D2 Phaser XE-T X-ray diffractometer system with a scan rate and range of 20 set as 5\u00b0 min 1 and 5\u00b0-70\u00b0, of MXene, CNTs, and sample-3; the characteristic peak of Ti,C,Tx at 20 of 6.9\u00b0 indicates the diffraction from the (002) phase of Ti;C,Tx.\n\n[0086] The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) sur- vey scan exhibits the coexistence of C, O, F, and Ti elements in C-PVDF/MXene-CNTs (FIG. 1H). FIGS. 11 and 1J exhibit the high-resolution O 1s and F ls spectrum of C-PVDF and C-PVDF/MXene-CNTs. For O Is spectrum, the peaks at 532 and 530.5 eV are associated with \u2014C\u2014O bond and \u4e00 C \u4e00 OH bond of C-PVDF (FIG. 1D, respec- tively. The peaks are negatively moved to lower binding energy by about 1.3 cV in C-PVDF/MXene-CNTs via the \u2014F ...H\u2014O interaction between the \u2014Fon C-PVDF and \u2014OH group of carboxylated CNTs. The \u2014C\u2014F peak of C-PVDF from F Is spectrum is shifted to a lower binding energy by ~0.2 eV in the electrosprayed sample (FIG. 1J). The consistent result is also observed from the high-resolu- tion C Is spectrum (FIGS. 11A-11B). These results demon- strate the formation of a stable interface interaction between C-PVDF and MXenes/CNTs.", "type": "Document"}}
