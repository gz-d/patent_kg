The first, second, and third optical paths may be arranged at least partly in parallel with each other.\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\n[0035] In one embodiment of the sixth aspect, the first optical processing sub-unit includes a power adjuster arranged to adjust a power of the laser pulse provided by the pulsed laser source.\n\n[0036] In one embodiment of the sixth aspect, the second optical processing sub-unit includes an optical regulator arranged to alter a wavelength of the laser pulse provided by the pulsed laser source by excitation based on stimulate Raman scattering and to introduce a time delay to the laser pulse provided by the pulsed laser source. The optical regulator may include a single-mode optical fiber. The single-mode optical fiber may be a polarization-maintaining single-mode optical fiber.\n\n[0037] In one embodiment of the sixth aspect, the third optical processing sub-unit includes an optical regulator arranged to alter a wavelength of the laser pulse provided by the pulsed laser source by excitation based on stimulate Raman scattering and to introduce a time delay to the laser pulse provided by the pulsed laser source. The optical regulator may include a multi-mode optical fiber. The time delay introduced may be the same as the time delay intro- duced by the second optical processing sub-unit.", "type": "Document"}}
