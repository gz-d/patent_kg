The electronic switching circuit should periodically check the existence of the loads on the charging pad. Once the load compatibility has been favorably checked, the power electronic switching circuit should energize appropriate transmitter winding for energy transfer.\n\na typical single-layer winding array with many individual primary energy-transmitting coils 7 (named transmitter windings hereafter) in an inductive bat- tery charging pad. It is also proposed that a multilayer wind- ing array can also be used. For example, a stacked winding where each primary winding comprises a pair of coils pro- vided respectively on two sides of a substrate, such as a printed-circuit board, can be adopted to enhance the magnetic flux for the same foot-print area. In a stacked structure one coil in the pair may generally overly the other, but this need. not necessarily be exact and there may be a small offset. It should also be noted that a stacked structure can be extended", "type": "Document"}}
