As a result, even if the SDGD components are not ready for operation (e.g., steady state operation) immediately at the start-up of the system 2100, the diode bridge functionality is inherent in the system 2100 to desirably perform the function of multi-phase recti- fication of the input power signal, because the six body diodes 2128 through 2138 of the six switches 2102 through 2112 are arranged in the circuit to form a three-phase diode bridge that can rectify the applied input power signal to produce a desired rectified DC voltage as an output when the switches 2102 through 2012 are not turned on (e.g., during initial start-up of the SDSR prior to steady-state operation of the SDSR). In an aspect, the system 2100 can include a power source 2126, which can be a multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) AC source, that can be connected to, and can apply the input power signal (e.g., AC power signal) to, the power switches 2102 through\n\nTo make the analysis more clear, assume that the voltage of the capacitors C,, C,, and C, will remain constant at a voltage V.
