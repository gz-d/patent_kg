For example, the modified protein may include one or more mutations at R245 and/or N419 and a further mutation at R654. In a preferred embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 3 or a homologue thereof and includes a mutation at N413, N419, R245 and R654 positions, also referred to as SaCas9-HF. In an embodiment, the mutation at one or more of the N413, N419, R245 and/or R654 positions is a single amino acid substitution. In embodiment, the modified\n\nNon-specific binding at locations other than the target sequence, i.e. at off-target sites, of the CRISPR-Cas9 has been known to occur, thus resulting in cleaving of off-target sequences and causing non-specific genetic modifications.
