Each of the Mg NFC coils has an average thickness of about 40 jum and about 21 turns. The antenna is in a square shape, but any other regular shape or irregular shape which enables conduction is also possible. A dielectric interlayer between the two Mg NFC coils is also made of PLGA with a thickness of about 20 um. A doped silicon diode is used as a modulator of the antenna and being attached on the PLGA dielectric layer. Two exposed microneedle electrodes (~36 mm\u2019, 5x5 needles) are hot pressed on one end of two lines of magnesium (Mg) foil connecting the antenna, followed by coating a conductive layer of tungsten (W, 1 um). Then W paste (a mixture of W nanoparticle and candelilla wax) used to connect the two conductive layers.\n\nwas", "type": "Document"}}
