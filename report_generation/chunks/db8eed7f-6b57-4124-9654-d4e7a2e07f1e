In this example embodiment, the conditions monitoring engine 106 is arranged to process the condition information obtained by the conditions gateway so to devise and report a specific condition for the device. This specific condition could be a present condition as well as a future condition that may be predicted based on the condition information that is obtained by the device conditions gateway and processed by the condition information engine 106.\n\n[0063] The example embodiments of the system for moni- toring a device 100 may be advantageous as it allows for the detection and prediction of any operation conditions of a device. By processing the operation information, any abnor- mal conditions for a device may be identified quickly or predicted such that suitable actions can be undertaken to reduce the risk of damage or to maintain the safe operation of the device.", "type": "Document"}}
