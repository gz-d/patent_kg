In an aspect, the processor component 706 can be functionally coupled (e.g., through a memory bus) to the data store 708 in order to store and retrieve information desired to operate and/or confer func- tionality, at least in part, to the capture component 702, render component 704, and/or substantially any other operational\n\nIn another aspect, the capture component 702 can be employed to generate or synthesize a 3-D scene, wherein the capture component 702 can generate respective subsets of visual information from a plurality of respective positions in relation to the 3-D scene being synthesized to provide differ- ent perspectives of the 3-D scene. The various different posi- tions, associated with the respective subsets of visual infor- mation relating to the synthesized 3-D scene, can correspond to the barrier pattern mode (e.g., associated with an autoste- reoscopic barrier pattern) to be employed when reconstruct- ing and presenting the synthesized 3-D scene to the viewer,\n\nFIG. 7 illustrates a diagram of an example system 700 that\n\nreal 3-D scene is presented by the barrier component to the viewer.\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\ncomponents\n\nsystem\n\nUS 9,280,042 B2\n\n27\n\n28\n\nnents.
