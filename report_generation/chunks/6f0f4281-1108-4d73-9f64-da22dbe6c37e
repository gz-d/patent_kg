Quantitative enrichment is performed using RT-gPCR in three different regions of XIST and two different regions of MALAT1. GAPDH served as an internal control. Data is expressed as mean+SD, n=3; ** indicates p<0.01 using the unpaired Student\u2019s t test. The upper right figure shows the results of SNF2L antibody and IgG immunoprecipitation experiments.\n\n[0055] FIG. 2h shows the effects of TAF 15 and SNF2L in X-linked inhibition in mice. Female iMEF cells (E2C4) contain the GFP transgene on the inactivated X chromo- some, and its expression is completely suppressed (NT). After 5-aza treatment (NT+5-aza), GFP is derepressed.\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\nVarious shRNAs are used to knock out SmcHD1, TAF15 and SNF2L, and the GFP expression level is determined by RI-gPCR. Data is expressed as mean+SD, n=3, *p<0.05, **n<0.01, Student\u2019s t test.\n\n[0056] FIGS. 3a to 3e show the identification of IncRNA DANCR and MALATI related proteins by CARPID cells, wherein:\n\nliving\n\n[0057] FIG. 3a shows the identification of the DANCR- related proteome associated with CARPID. The volcano plot shows the enrichment of DANCR-related proteins in HEK293T cells. The x-axis represents the log 2 conversion of the protein level fold change in the CARPID combined with the two groups of DANCR gRNA in comparison with the control. The y-axis shows the negative logarithmic converted p-value (non-parametric rank product test). Sig- nificantly enriched proteins are marked as orange dots.", "type": "Document"}}
