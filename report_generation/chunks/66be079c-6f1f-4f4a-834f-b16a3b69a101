Characteristics Evaluation of the Biomimetic, Nanofiber-Based and Directional Moisture- Wicking Electronic Fabric Samples\n\n[0083] FIG. 1A and FIG. 1C illustrate the morphology of the C-PVDF hydrophobic nanofibers layer and the PAN hydrophilic nanofibers layer, respectively. The morphology is observed utilizing scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 250 e-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM20). The nanofibers exhibit a randomly distributed nonwoven fabric morphology. In FIG. 1B, the morphology of electrosprayed MXene/CNTs ink (sample-3) on the C-PVDF substrate is depicted; the MXene nanosheets and CNTs are uniformly distributed on the hydrophobic layer, maintaining the porous structure of hydrophobic lay- ers simultaneously. The SEM images of sample-1 and sample-2 with different electrospraying times are shown in FIG. 8. The most uniform deposited MXene/CNTs are obtained by sample-3 with an increased electrospraying\n\ntime.\n\n[0084] Additionally, the surface resistance changes of DMWES are shown in FIG. 9. The surface resistance of nonwoven membrane is measured by the digital four-probe\n\nthe the\n\nUS 2024/0260899 Al\n\ntester. The larger surface resistance of sample-1 and sample-2 should be ascribed to the incomplete conductive paths with low MXene/CNTs electrospraying time. The fiber\u2019s average diameters for the C-PVDF layer and the PAN layer are about 200 and 260 nm, respectively. The C-PVDF layer changes by approximately an order of magnitude, while the PAN layer shows more uniformly sized fibers (FIG. 1D). Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B, the mean pore diameters generated in the PAN layer and C-PVDF layer due to fiber interlaced with each other are 0.47 and 0.507 um, which grow by layer and may be conducive to the enhanced capillary force of the hydrophilic pores.", "type": "Document"}}
