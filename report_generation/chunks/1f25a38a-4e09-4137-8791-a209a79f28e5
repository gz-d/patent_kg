With reference to Figure 8, the measured efficiency is higher than 72.5% from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz, with a maximum of 78.5% at 5.74 GHz. The simulated peak efficiency is 89.7% at 5.98 GHz. The efficiency decreases rapidly on the band-edge and then becomes small in the stopbands, giving a sharp selectivity. Since the antenna 200, 400 is matched across the entire band (5-6.5 GHz), it can be inferred that the energy is mostly dissipated in the chip resistor in the antenna stopbands. This illustrates that a well-matched antenna does not necessarily radiate effectively. Again, the simulated result of the reference patch antenna is included in Figure 8. As expected, the reference patch antenna does not have any sharp filtering response.\n\nThe simulated power loss In the chip resistor 1s shown in Figure 9. The results In Figure 9 have been normalized with respect to the maximum at 5.24 GHz. With reference to Figure 9, the normalized power loss 1s lower than 0.12 ln the 1-dB gain passband (5.63\u20145.97 GHz) and higher than 0.85 ln the stopbands (5.00\u20145.44 GHz and 6.12\u20146.50 GHz) with sharp band-edge selectivity. It should be noted that the frequency response of the normalized power loss in Figure 9 is almost complementary to that of the simulated efficiency in Figure 8. This suggests that the band-stop filter and the filtering patch antenna have generally-complementary transfer functions, which are required to reduce or eliminate reflection.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nWO 2021/078090\n\nPCT/CN2020/121825\n\n10\n\nThe above embodiments of the invention have generally provided a filter-antenna that can", "type": "Document"}}
