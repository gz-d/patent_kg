Microneedle-based drug delivery system is typically triggered by electric stimulation to initiate the drug delivery. A combination of implantable and microneedle approaches to enable drug delivery seems to offer a more powerful, localized and controllable pharmacological treatment than standalone electrostimulation or microneedle drug delivery device.\n\n[0005] However, implantable electrostimulation devices or tissue regeneration require higher safety and biocompat- ibility standards than non-invasive/non-implantable electro- stimulation devices, as it involves application in vivo. implantable electrostimulation devices are also subject to size, shape and mechanical design limitations. Some tradi- tional implantable devices may carry risks of causing infec- tion to recipients, imposing constrains to their mobility, and causing tissue damage during implantation or when there is harmful material leakage. In this regard, some implantable devices incorporate transient electronics which allow biore- sorbable or biodegradable devices after the implantation and application. Another important concern when designing an implantable electrostimulation device is power supply and how it is controlled.\n\n[0006] A need therefore exists for a fully implantable, wirelessly controlled power supply-integrated, bioresorb- able or biodegradable, microneedle-based electrostimulation device for drug delivery and other potential applications that\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\neliminates or at least diminishes the disadvantages problems described above in the conventional technologies.\n\nand", "type": "Document"}}
