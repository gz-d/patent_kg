In this embodiment, the upper surface takes a hemi- spherical shape, but it will be understood that any suitable shape could be used to form the DR 116 into a lens for focusing light onto the solar cell 114. In other embodiments, the DR 116 may be shaped to convey light away from an optical light transmitting component of an electronic device. This is particularly useful where the DR is positioned in an electronic device in a light pathway 132 of another compo- nent such asa solar cell or a light transmitting device 130 such as a lamp or the like.\n\nThe transparent DRA 12 is proposed to circumvent a prob- lem associated with known transparent microstrip antennas in that the transparent DRA of the invention does not need any conducting parts to resonate.", "type": "Document"}}
