FIGS. 11a to lle illustrate a circuit schematic of said another example of a voltage regulator according to the invention. FIG. 11a shows a block diagram of a Motorola TL494 Switchmode Pulse width Modulation Control Circuit analog IC which forms the basic circuit for the voltage regulator (without any compen- sation circuitry) according to this further example of the invention. FIG. 114 illustrates the pin connections of this known analog IC circuit. FIG. 11c\u00a2 is a schematic diagram of said known voltage regulator IC circuit minus the compensa- torcircuit. FIG. 11d is also a schematic circuit diagram of said known IC circuit, but illustrating the nodes required for con- necting a compensator circuit according to the invention to said IC circuit. FIG. 11e shows the compensator circuit with the required nodes for connecting to the circuit of FIG. 11d to form an output compensated regulator circuit according to the invention. In the following description, like numerals to those describe the of the first\n\nFIG. 10 illustrates how the circuit of the typical voltage regulator circuit of FIG. 9 is modified to connect a dynamic output compensator circuit according to the invention. In the following description, like numerals to those already employed to describe the voltage regulator of the first example of the invention depicted by FIGS. 2, 5, 6 and 8 will be used to denote like parts.", "type": "Document"}}
