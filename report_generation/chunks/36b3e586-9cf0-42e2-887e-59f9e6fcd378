For example, most exist- ing metasurfaces are passive in which their functionalities are set and cannot be altered once fabricated. Yet, many modern wave-empowered applications such as communica- tions, holographic displays, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), etc., require dynamic and active controls for environment adaptation and/or information processing. For example, while some tunable metasurfaces integrated with active functional materials have been explored to achieve dynamic wave controls upon the external stimuli (including electrical bias, mechanical deformation, optical pumping, and/or thermal excitation), most of these tunable metasur- faces can control only one or two wave properties due to insufficient degrees of freedom in the geometrical param- eters of the elements and the external control variables to support regulation of all of the fundamental properties. For example, independent wave properties manipulations may be difficult as the controls over these fundamental properties of EM wave are generally coupled with each other. While unique geometric structures and co-optimization with active materials may be adopted to decouple, e.g., amplitude and phase regulations, the design complexity and insertion loss are amplified geometrically with the increase of the control\n\ndegrees of freedom.", "type": "Document"}}
