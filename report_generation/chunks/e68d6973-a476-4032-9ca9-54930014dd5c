Further, enabling switching of an active parallax arrier to enable desired display of 3-D content and ordinary 2-D content can require modification of the original hardware circuit and/or software of the projector (or a device which drives the projector). It also may be necessary to provide a ower supply to the active parallax barrier, and establish some kind of communication link (e.g., RF, infrared, etc.) between the active parallax barrier and the projection system.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nsince the 1950s. Conventionally, 3-D visual effects have been realized in part by having the viewers wear glasses having a pair of polarized lens, a pair of chromatically opposite lens, or shutter glass spectacles. More recently, lens-free 3-D visual effects have been realized by using multiple cameras to cap- ture multiple angles of a scene, wherein a monitor, employing a lenticular lens array, reconstructs the multiple views for display to the viewers. Such an arrangement is generally expensive and heavy. Another technique for producing lens- free 3-D visual effects is employing a parallax barrier that can reconstruct multiple views of a 3-D scene for display to viewers. The parallax barrier is relatively lower in cost and. lighter in weight, as compared a monitor employing a len- lens", "type": "Document"}}
