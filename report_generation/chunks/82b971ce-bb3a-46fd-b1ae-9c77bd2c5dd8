This process normally occurs in growth and development, and wound healing by restoring blood flow to tissues. How- ever, loss of control in angiogenesis is a common factor in most important diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (Liekens et al., 2001). These diseases may result from or progress when new blood vessels either grow exces- sively or insufficiently. Excessive angiogenesis occurs, for example, in cancer by abnormal production of excessive amounts of angiogenic growth factors in order to form new blood vessels for excessive demand of nutrient. On the other hands, insufficient angiogenesis occurs, for example, in coro- nary artery disease, causing tissue damage and death due to inadequate production of angiogenic growth factor for suffi- cient growth of blood vessels. Therefore, therapies aimed at treating the loss of the control in angiogenesis are actively\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
