After that, a gold film was deposited onto the PVA-covered glass substrate via ion beam sputtering at the working pressure of 0.1 Pa and ion beam current of 10 mA. The thickness of the deposited gold film was controlled by varying the deposition time. The deposition of Au onto PVA can lead to the formation of a subsurface Au-organic layer and even partial carbonization of PVA. The subsequent interfacial fracture further faclll- tates chemical bond breakage and carbonization, eventually leading to the formation of the freestanding carbon-contain- ing gold nanosheet. The presence of amorphous carbon is\n\nevident even before exfoliation.\n\n[0081] Finally, the Au-PVA-glass system was immersed water for few minutes. After that, freestanding nanosheets spontaneously delaminated from the PVA. The resulting nanosheets contained two phases, 1.e., the Au-rich FCC phase and carbon-rich amorphous phase.\n\nln\n\n[0082] By using the PSBEE, it is able to synthesize freestanding ultrathin carbon-containing metal (hereafter referred to as metal-C) nanosheets, which may have a centimeter in-plane size and thickness down to approxi- mately 10 nm.\n\n[0083] Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC):\n\n[0084]\n\nThermal analysis\n\nwas\n\nperformed\n\non\n\nthe\n\nmetal-", "type": "Document"}}
