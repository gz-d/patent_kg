According to the present invention, a con- stant or substantially constant force can be provided for spinal deformity correction. Such a correction force is capable of gradually counteracting the viscoelastic phenomenon of the spine. Accordingly, the present invention is capable of fully or substantially fully correcting spinal deformities. Such correc- tion can be carried out with or without further manipulation of the correction force after the correction force is applied to the deformed spine portion.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates generally to spinal deformity correction. More specifically, the present invention is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force or a similar correction force and maintaining such cor- rection force constant or substantially constant until spinal deformities are corrected. The present invention can correct various spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphosis, lor- dosis, and the rotation around the longitudinal axis of the spine. Additionally or alternatively, the present invention can provide horizontal plane correction of spinal deformities.\n\nFor example, a superelastic or pseudoelastic material can be used to provide a constant or substantially constant cor- rection force or a similar force, which can be applied to a deformed spine portion. The constant correction force so provided is capable of gradually and continuously correcting inal deformities. In an exemplary embodiment, a NiTi alloy an be used to providea constant or substantially constant and ontrollable correction force. It will be appreciated that other mbodiment of superelastic or pseudoelastic materials are within the of the invention. 2seoae", "type": "Document"}}
