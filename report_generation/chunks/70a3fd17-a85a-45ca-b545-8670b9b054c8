In the following description, like numerals to\n\nUS 8,169,201 B2\n\n5\n\n6\n\nexamples which are provided by way of example only connection with the accompanying figures, of which:\n\nThe regulator with compensator circuit may comprise single IC. Alternatively, the compensator circuit may com- prise a separate circuit arranged for connection to the regula- circuit.\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates the structure of a typical switched type voltage regulator circuit;\n\nAccording to another main aspect of the invention, there is provided a compensator circuit for a regulator having means for sensing an output signal at a passive component at an output of the regulator, means for generating a ripple com- pensating signal based on a difference signal, the difference signal comprising a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regulator and the sensed output signal, and means for applying the ripple passive component to thereby ing the difference between the and the sensed output signal, configured such that the comp process a whole of an output compensating signal to the reduce a ripple signal compris- level of the reference signal the compensator circuit being ensator circuit does not have to load power of the regulator.\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates the structure of a first example of a regu- according to the invention;\n\nFIGS. 3a to 3c illustrate respectively the reference voltage signal v,. the output voltage signal v,, absent compensation the compensation voltage signal v, of the voltage regulator of FIG. 2; comp\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates the structure of a second example of a regulator according to the invention;\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates in more detail the structure of the first example of a regulator according to the invention as depicted FIG. 2;\n\nFIG. 6 illustrates a practical implementation of the regula- example of FIG. 5;", "type": "Document"}}
