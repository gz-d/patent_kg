This novel method was applied to scene perception. Using the novel EMHMM with co-clustering method of the invention, explorative (switching between foreground and background information) and focused (mainly on foreground) eye movement strategies were detected. Explorative patterns were associated with better foreground object recognition performance whereas those with focused patterns had better feature integration in the flanker task and more efficient planning in the Tower of London (TOL) task. Advantageously, these novel methods can be used to employ eye tracking as a window into individual differences in cognitive abilities and for screening of cognitive deficits.\n\nScene perception involves complex and dynamic perceptual and cognitive processes", "type": "Document"}}
