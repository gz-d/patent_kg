The ATP- dependent helicase ATRX found in CARPID belongs to these categories. This gene is also reported in an indepen- dent study, asserting that it played a role in guiding the polycomb complex PRC2 to the X chromosome for inacti- vation and gene silencing. These findings of the present invention strongly indicate that CARPID is a highly reliable method for determining RBP.\n\n[0108] In addition to the known XIST interactors\uff0c CARPID has also identified a variety of new factors, includ- ing the transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit TAF 15 (FIG. Tc FIG. 1d). TAF15 is known to interact with TATA- box binding protein (TBP) and RNA polymerase II, and act as a co-activator that recognizes the core promoter and promotes transcription initiation. The present invention\n\nUS 2021/0340592 Al\n\nfirstly confirms the association between TAF15 and XIST", "type": "Document"}}
