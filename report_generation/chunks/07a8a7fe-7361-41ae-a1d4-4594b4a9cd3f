In particular, the filter was opti- mized first along with the sampling rate. For EMG signals, the recorded file was processed using the function of channel process. Background noise of the data was removed using DC remove in channel process. Further, data was rectified and smoothened. A median filter was applied and root mean square (RMS) amplitude was determined. For DCN neuro- spike, neurospike was recorded using low pass and high pass filter and customized MATLAB program was used for the\n\nNeurobehavioral Tests on the Mice\n\n[0104] To determine whether the neurostimulation system the present invention is useful in modulating an abnormal behaviour of the mice, several tests were conducted\n\nof\n\nwere analysed by MaxTraQ (Innovision system Inc., USA).\n\ntime compared to the control group (n=5-7).\n\nof\n\nmotor\n\nDec. 31 , 2020\n\nUS 2020/0406031 A1\n\n6\n\ndid not show significant change during the DCN simulation .\n\nby using the control group and DKO group .
