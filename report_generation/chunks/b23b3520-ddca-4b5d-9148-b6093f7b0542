In an aspect, system 2000 can include six switches, comprising switch 2002, switch 2004, switch 2006, switch 2008, switch 2010, and switch 2012, which can be power switches that can facilitate synchronously rectifying the input multi-phase AC power signal. The switches 2002 through 2012 can form the main circuit for multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) full-wave rectification. In an embodiment, the switches 2002 through 2012 can be power MOSFETs. In another aspect, the six switches 2002 through 2012 can be oriented in a circuit in relation to each other to form a multi- phase synchronous rectifier, which can be in the form of, function as, or emulate a diode bridge, and can rectify an input multi-phase AC power signal and produce a desired DC signal as an output. In accordance with an embodiment, the high- side switches, switch 2002, switch 2004, and switch 2006 can be VCSD switches, and the low-side switches, switch 2008, switch 2010, and switch 2012 can be CCSD switches, although it is to be appreciated and understood that, in accor- dance with other embodiments, switch 2002, switch 2004, and/or switch 2006 can be CCSD switches, instead of VCSD switches. In an aspect, the multi-phase synchronous rectifier of the system 2000 can be employed in high-voltage power applications (e.g., 110 V or 220 V mains) and/or high fre-", "type": "Document"}}
