(2) The anti- dehydration elastomeric coating layer can prevent evapora- tion of water molecules from the inner gel matrix, endowing the organohydrogel with good consistency and durability at high temperatures.\n\nL\n\n[0208] where a is ionic conductivity of polymer electro- lyte, and 1, R, and A represent the thickness, the bulk resistance, and the test area of polymer electrolyte, respec- tively.\n\n[0209] With the use of the design principles, a family AD-gel electrolyte with elastomeric coating was synthesized according to the proposed fabrication method (FIG. 2a). The morphology of the as-synthesized AD-gel was examined SEM.\n\n[0216] In terms of the long-term stability, dehydration test was carried out on the AD-gel and PAM-hydrogel electro- lytes with the same dimensions. The test was performed at 25\u00b0 C. and 50% humidity, and the weight retention of the AD-gel and PAM-hydrogel electrolytes was recorded at different time intervals. As illustrated in FIGS. 9A and 9B, the weight of AD-gel electrolyte was minorly drifted (<2%) even after 30 days of storage, whereas the PAM-hydrogel electrolyte lost most its weight after the initial 5 days and finally dried out to become a hard scaffold (FIG. 9A).\n\n[0210] With reference to FIG. 3A, it is revealed that the AD-gel has a coating of approximately 200 wm. Cross- sectional SEM mapping and EDS results intuitively depict the conformal and continuous interface between organohy- drogel matrix (i.e. Zn-alginate/PAM) and superficial coating (i.e. PDMS) with close contact.
