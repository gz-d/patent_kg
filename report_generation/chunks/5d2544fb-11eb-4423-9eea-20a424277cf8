A vapor channel is posi- tioned between the solution channel and the refrigerant channel. The reactor further includes a first fluid channel having a heat source/heat sink fluid flowing therethrough and a second fluid channel having a heat source/heat sink transfer fluid flowing therethrough. A first porous membrane is positioned between the refrigerant channel and the vapor channel. A second porous membrane is positioned between the vapor channel and the solution channel. The porous membrane permits flow of vapor molecules therethrough while restricting flow of absorbent molecules. A solution storage repository stores the absorbent-containing solution and is in fluid communication with the solution channel. Similarly, a refrigerant repository stores the refrigerant and\n\nis in fluid communication with the refrigerant channel.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0014] FIG. 1 depicts a membrane-based reactor accord- ing to an embodiment;\n\n[0015] FIG. 2 depicts a thermal energy storage system incorporating the membrane-based reactor of FIG. 1;\n\n[0016] FIG. 3 depicts a cold discharge process using thermal energy storage system of FIG. 2;\n\nthe\n\nFIG. 4 depicts a heat discharge process using thermal energy storage system of FIG. 2;\n\n[0017]\n\nthe\n\n[0018] FIG. 5 depicts a membrane-based reactor accord- ing to a further embodiment;\n\nUS 2023/0075850 Al\n\na\n\n[0019] FIG. 6 depicts a thermal energy storage system incorporating the membrane-based reactor of FIG. 5 during charging process;\n\na\n\n[0020] FIG. 7 depicts a thermal energy storage system incorporating the membrane-based reactor of FIG. 5 during cold discharging process;\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
