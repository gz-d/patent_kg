The measured 3D near- field focus-steering performance on the three focal planes is plotted in FIG. 14(e). As in FIG. 14(c), the measured results in FIG. 14(/), are obtained by adding the measured power densities for all the focus steering cases on each focal plane. Again, a good agreement between the measured and simu- lated results can be observed from FIG. 14(d), (\u00a2). All these results demonstrate the 3D focus-steering capability of the metalens system.\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n[0064] The above implementation of the invention can realize fast 3D near-field focus beam scanning upon counter rotation, co-rotation of the lens pair and a linear movement of the upper lens. Electromagnetic imaging, sensing, detec- tion and radar systems can use the present near-field focus- ing antennas with fast-steering capability. The compact, low-loss and fast-steering characteristics of the 3D focus- steering terahertz lens antenna make it suitable for wide- spread applications including non-destructive detection, security, biology/medical sciences, and fast 3D imaging. The invention can be used in, e.g., airports/train stations/subways body security checks, RFID systems, terahertz food inspec- tion and quality control, biology and medical sciences. In particular, the present invention may find use in applications that require a wide field of view; a field of view of 80\u00b0=80\u00b0 can be achieved in one implementation of the invention, which significantly outperforms existing designs with a limited field of view of 1.1\u00b0=1.1\u00b0.", "type": "Document"}}
