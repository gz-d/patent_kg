Cardiotoxicity\n\nEmbryos prepared for microangiography should be immo- bilized by agarose. Agarose solution (0.3%) is prepared and. kept at around 45\u00b0 C. on a heat block. Embryos are to be transferred to a clean slide by using a Pasteur pipette with a broad opening. To avoid yolk sac damaging, a small drop of solution should be added to the embryo before addition of pre-heat 0.3% agarose to the embryo. With a 27 G needle, the embryo is arranged to their lateral position just before the agarose hardens. After agarose hardening, circulation at the tail region is examined under dissection microscope with CCD camera connected either to a personal computer equipped with video grabbing device or to digital video cam- era. In the case of digital video camera, data stored in mini- DV tape is transferred back to personal computer via i-Link connection and saved in AVI format for video image analysis. After video image analysis, data for the power spectrum of blood cell movement is obtained. Two parameters are derived from the power spectrum. The first parameter representing the heart rate is the basic frequency component which is the value of frequency with biggest power value. The second\n\nLinearized plasmids are then transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase or T7 RNA polymerase in a transcription cock- tail, incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. for the preparation of non-radioactive digoxigenin transcripts. The reaction is to be stopped by adding 1 ul of EDTA (0.5M, pH8.0). The addition of 2.5 ul of LiCl (4M) and 75 ll of cold ethanol is done to precipitate the RNA probe by centrifuging at full speed for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The pellet is then washed with 70% ethanol, left for air dry on bench and resuspended in RNase-free (DEPC) water.", "type": "Document"}}
