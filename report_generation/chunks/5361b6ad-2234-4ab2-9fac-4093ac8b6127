The obtained black jelly is ultrasonicated in DI water for 2 h under argon protection and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm. The concentration of the colloidal Ti,C,Tx nanosheets solu- tion is approximately 8 mg mL~\u2019. The corresponding TEM image of Ti,C,Tx nanosheets is shown in FIG. 6. Carboxy- lated CNTs (30 mg) is dispersed in a 20 mL alcohol/water solution (5/5, v/v), and this solution is added to the Ti;C,Tx MXene nanosheets colloidal solution (20 mL). To achieve a stable solution ink, the solution is ultrasonicated for 30 min and stirred for 6 h. The TEM image of the MXenc/CNTs ink are shown in FIG. 7, respectively. The solution conductivity of the MXene/CNTs ink is 9.22 pS cm 1.\n\n[0082]\n\nIna preferred embodiment, a thin and hydrophobic", "type": "Document"}}
