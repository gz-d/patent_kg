For example, a size of \u201cabout 0.1-3 hm in diameter\u201d should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited diameter range of about 0.1 hm to about 3 hm, but also the individual diam- eters (e.g., 1%, 2%, and 3%) and the sub-ranges (e.g., 0.1 to 0.5 um, 1.1 to 2.2 jum, etc) within the indicated range. A weight ratio of \u201cabout 10-15 wt. %\u201d should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited weight ratio range of about 10 wt. % to about 15 wt. %, but also the individual weight ratio (e.g., 11 wt. %, 12 wt. %, 13 wt. %, and 14 wt. %), and the subranges (e.g., to 10.5 wt %, 11.1 to 12.2 wt.\n\n%, 13.3 to 14.4 wt. %, etc) within the indicated range.\n\n[0038] The term \u201cabout\u201d as used herein allows for a degree of variability in a value or range, for example, within 10%, within 5%, within 1%, within 0.5%, within 0.1%, or within 0.01% of a stated value or of a stated limit of a range. Alternatively, the term \u201cabout\u201d means within an acceptable standard error of the mean when considered by one of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the present disclosure and attached claims are approximations that can vary as desired.", "type": "Document"}}
