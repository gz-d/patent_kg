The electronic fabric is equiva- lent to a serial circuit that contains three variable resistances. The equivalent circuit of the resistance is exhibited in FIG. 16. When the external pressure is imposed on the electronic skin, the contact point in the conductive network of C-PVDF/MxXene-CNTs increases relatively. A significant decrease in the contact resistance (R,) and bulk resistance (R,) of the electronic fabric will be observed. The R; change of the electronic fabric is determined by the contact dimen- sion between the MXene-CNTs electrospraying side and interdigital electrode. The sensing layer and the electrode are not in close contact with each other in the original no- pressure condition; hence, a high R, exists initially at their interface, and then, it decreases under increased pressure. R, exhibits a significant response to tiny pressure. When the electronic fabric is exposed to higher pressure, the R; variation will attain saturation rapidly, and R, will decrease gradually under higher pressure, giving the electronic fabric\n\na wider detection range.\n\n5.
