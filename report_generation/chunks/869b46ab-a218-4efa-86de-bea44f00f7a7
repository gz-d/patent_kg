For\n\ninduction heating systems, the heat distribution should be as uniform as possible. In addition, only the overlapped area of the primary induction surface and the secondary clement provides energy transfer. In order to achieve these functions, the AC magnetic flux experienced by the secondary element should be as even as possible. A standard spiral winding as shown in Fig.1(a) is not suitable to meet this requirement because its flux distribution is not uniform as shown in Fig.1(b) when the winding is excited by an AC power source, The reason for such non-uniform magnetic flux distribution is that the number of turns in the central region of the single spiral winding largest. As the magnetic flux or magnetomorive force (mmf) is proportional to the product of the number of turn and the current in the winding, the magnitude of the magnetic flux or mmf is highest\n\nin the centre of the winding.\n\nthat\n\nAn improved method proposed in this invention is to ensure the magnetic distribution experienced by secondary element is as uniform as possible. This method can be realized by using a \u201cdistributed\u201d primary transformer winding array structure as shown in Fig.3. This planar winding array consists of many spiral windings. These spiral windings can have hexagonal, circular, square or rectangular patterns. These transformer windings can be connected in series, in parallel or a combination of both to the high-frequency AC voltage generated in the power circuit.\n\nsupply in the primary charger shows", "type": "Document"}}
