Upon the arrival of the partici- pant, the experimenter introduced the procedure of the experiment, collected the participant\u2019s biographical infor- mation, and demonstrated the ThermEarhook prototype. In each session, the participant was first assisted to wear the pair of ThermEarhook prototypes on both his/her ears. The thermal stimuli were then activated, starting from P1 to P3/4/5 on the same side, with the corresponding point highlighted in GUI. Each stimulus lasted for 1.5 s. Mean- while, the experimenter verbally explained the position of the stimulus and the nature of each stimulation to familiarize the participant with the stimuli. The participant could choose\n\nUS 2023/0122309 Al\n\nrepeat the current stimulus for training or move to the next by verbally reporting to the experimenter.\n\nto\n\none\n\n[0075] After training, the participant started the testing block, where the stimuli were presented in a randomized order. The selection interface was displayed after each stimulation. The participant was also instructed to make a respective selection on the touch screen as fast as possible once he/she felt and confirmed the stimulus. The timestamp of the participant making the selection on the screen was used to calculate the response time. There was a 7 s break between two consecutive stimuli. Between two experiment sessions, a temperature-resetting and resting period of 5 minutes was given to the participant. A short semi-structured interview was conducted at the end of the experiment to collect the participant\u2019s subjective comments on his/her experience of ThermEarhook. The overall experiment dura- tion per participant was approximately one hour.\n\n[0076] Results:", "type": "Document"}}
