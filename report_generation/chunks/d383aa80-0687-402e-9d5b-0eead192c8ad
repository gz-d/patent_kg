The specimens (1 mm thick and 5 mm in diameter) were fixed onto the bottom of a 24-well tissue culture plate (Fal- con) using 1% (w/v) agarose. A cell suspension of 5,000 cells was seeded onto the surface of the untreated NiTi samples and. the three types of plasma-implanted samples (oxygen, nitro- gen, and acetylene). Cells were grown in one ml of medium and changed every two days. Cell attachment and prolifera- tion were examined after the second day of culture. After culturing for two days, the cells started to attach to and pro- liferate on all the samples. Our results unequivocally demon- strate that there is no immediate cytotoxic effect on all of the\n\nEspana, A., et al., \u201cChronic Urticaria After Implantation 2 Nickel-Containing Dental Prostheses in a Nickel-Aller- gic Patient,\u2019 Contact Dermat. 1989; 21:204-206.\n\nSanford, W.
