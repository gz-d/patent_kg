It is worth noting that the all-fiber based electronic fabric exhibits stable pulse signal even after exercise, demonstrating that the directional moisture transport capability enables the relatively stable test environment of MXene/CNTs sensing layer. The pulse monitoring performance of the DMWES in the simulated\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nsweat environment with NaC] solution is also evaluated. As\n\nshown in FIGS. 20A-20B, it is observed that the electronic fabric can still clearly detect pulse signals in the simulated sweat (wet state), comparing to dry state. But the current intensity is higher because of more conductive paths as water penetrated into the conductive and hydrophilic layers. The increased internal contact interfaces result in the decrease in the pulse peak intensity variation. In FIG. 5F, the pulse wave of two users (a 28-year-old male man and a 30-year-old male man for user 1 and user 2, respectively) is tested. The analysis of stationary signals shows radial artery frequencies of ~66 and ~84 BPM. respectively. indicating the good health state of two users. As presented in the enlarged pulse of FIG. 5F, the typical peaks (P-wave, T-wave, and D-waye) are clearly captured and distinguished. The significant health indicators like refection index (RL, Eq. 3) and stiffness index (S.L, Eq. 4) are also observed from the response time by resolving the two distinct peaks of P-wave and T-wave (At), and the intensity of P-wave and T-wave (b and a, respectively).
