According to\n\nthe\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\ntime-shifting property of the Fourier Transform, a shift t, in\n\nthe time domain corresponds to a linear phase shift -2amf,A,; in the frequency domain. Therefore, the total phase shift of the radiated propagating wave (PW) includes two parts (FIG. 26): (i) the phase accumulation from the propagation of guided wave (GW) @\u00a2y=-E\u00a2 yx, (where Egy is the wavenumber inside the waveguide) and (ii) the abrupt phase shift induced by the spatiotemporal modulation \u4e2d sz=- 2nmf,A,(x). The corresponding linear momentum of the radiated propagating wave along the x direction is k.(fo+ mfy)-Eoytks;. where k,,=2nmf,, dt,(x)/ax is the addi- tional momentum imparted by the spatiotemporal modula- tion. In one example (FIG. 4A), this momentum is leveraged to compensate for the momentum mismatch between the waveguide and free space at the target m-+1 harmonic frequency, ie., -\u00a7,,-.1~Eew+ks7\u201c,,-41, where \u00a7,,,, is the free-space wavenumber at the m=+1 harmonic frequency. Other unwanted harmonics are not supported and are sup- pressed in both free space and the waveguide due to the significant momentum mismatch (FIG. 27). In this manner, a nearly perfect guided-wave-to-propagating-wave conver- sion and frequency shifting can be simultaneously achieved by the universal metasurface antenna 400. FIG. 5 shows the measured propagating wave spectra with different values of frequency shifting (from -1.8 MHz to +1.8 MHz, in the step\n\nof 0.6 MHz) by changing the modulation frequency fy,\n\n[0158] The universal metasurface antenna 400 also enable momentum control of EM waves. Suppose the applied time gradient ot,(x)/ox is a constant, the radiated propagating wave has a well-defined radiation angle @,=sin7'(kJ&,,,). Therefore, the momentum and the corresponding output angle of the radiated propagating wave can be readily tuned by changing the applied time gradient (FIG. 6).\n\n[0159]", "type": "Document"}}
