Briefly, as shown in 4A, slot-opening based meta-atoms are\n\nFIG.\n\narranged at the top of the substrate integrated waveguide 404 to convert the guided wave into propagating wave with software-defined properties. 1-bit \u201c0/1\u201d space-time-coding sequences are applied to switch the meta-atoms between radiating (\u201c1\u201d) and non-radiating (\u201c0\u201d) states, thus control- ling the fundamental properties of the radiated wave. In this example, only the momentum of the target harmonic fre- quency (m=+1 harmonic in this example) matches with that of free space; other unwanted higher-order harmonics are suppressed in both the waveguide and free space without phase-matching. FIG. 4B shows the configuration of the anisotropic meta-atom, which includes two +45\u00b0-inclined loop-shaped slot openings each loaded with a pair of PIN diodes. FIG. 5 shows measured frequency shifting with different modulation frequencies. The inset in FIG. 5 shows the measured spectrum in dB scale with the modulation frequency of 1.8 MHz. FIGS. 6 to 9 illustrate manipulations of the EM wave properties by the universal metasurface antenna 400. Specifically, FIG. 6 relates to momentum control, FIG. 7 relates to phase control, FIG. 8 relates to amplitude control, and FIG. 9 relates to polarization control. In these examples, the controls are achieved by adjusting or tuning the time gradient ot,(x)/ox, reference time shift t,_,, duty cycle t, and time gradient and reference time shift for the lu), lv) polarizations, respectively. In these examples of FIGS. 6 to 9, the input frequency and modulation frequency\n\nare fo=23.3 GHz and f,-1.8 MHz, respectively.
