The finding suggests that a more explorative eye movement strategy during scene perception may be beneficial for remembering the foreground object due to more retrieval cues available through exploration. Consistent with this suggestion, it has been shown that associative processing 1s inherent in scene perception suggesting that an explorative strategy may facilitate associative processing and consequently enhance scene memory. This finding is in contrast to the face recognition literature, where the eye-focused strategy, which 1s associated with engagement of local attention and the focused strategy reported here, was reported to lead to better recognition performance due to better retrieval of diagnostic features, the eyes.\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n22", "type": "Document"}}
