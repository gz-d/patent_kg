High performance such as high capacity and excellent cyclic stability and reversibility can be simultane- ously achieved when combining proper electrolyte and additives that, e.g., provide multiple redox-reactive sites. The COF also provides a large specific area that is essential for efficient ion insertion and extraction.\n\n8.
