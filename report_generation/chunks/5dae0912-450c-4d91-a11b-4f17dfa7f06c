The electron emission element can be activated by various means, e.g., electric field or heat (or both), to emit electron beams. The electron emission ele- ment, the electrode, and the control element can take any potential or voltage values so long as the potential of the control element is more negative than the potential of the electron emission element and the potential of the electrode is more positive than the potential of the electron emission element. The control circuit can include various means for adjusting the electric potential for the control element, including the variable resistance circuit illustrated. The variable resistance circuit can be constructed using different electronic components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches, etc.) arranged in a different electrical connections. The resistors need not be connected only in series. The number of resistors can be changed. A variable resistor may be used in addition to or in place of the resistor-and-photo- relay unit. The control of the control circuit by the user through actuator that receives a user input or by a detector", "type": "Document"}}
