FIG. 10B illustrates a 3D view of a Hoechst 33342 stained NPC460 cell and the cross-sectional views across x-, y- and z-planes. Laser confocal microscopy is used to obtain 3D images of Hoechst 33342 stained nuclei to further verify whether nuclei of NP460 and NPC43 cells are in substantially spherical shapes. Briefly, a fluorescent nucleus is scanned from the top to bottom across multiple planes (typically ~100 planes scanned) on a laser confocal microscope and 3D view of stained nucleus is generated. As shown in FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B, nuclei of both NPC43 and NP460 cells are in substantially spherical shapes. Accord- ingly, performing the measurements with the assumption that of NPC43 and NP460 cells and nuclei are soft spheres result in accurate outcome and less\n\nmore\n\nerrors.\n\nEffective Pressure Difference on Single Confining Microfluidic Channels\n\n[0117] FIG. 11A illustrates diagram of the flow sections in the whole microfluidic device. To study the effective pres- sure difference driven on a single confining microfluidic channel, the total microfluidic device is divided into several flow sections. As illustrated in FIG. 11A, the whole device can be considered as consisting of a main flow section (Rm), four bypass channels (R1, R2, R3, R4), and a downstream outflow channel (Rout).\n\n[0118] FIG. 11B illustrates a circuit model of flow resis- tances distributions for flow sections. The effective pressure differences on each flow section can be calculated by con- sidering circuit model of flow resistances. As shown in FIG. 11B, the flow resistance of the whole microfluidic device can be considered as a main flow section connected in parallel with four bypass channels and then connected in series with an outflow channel. The flow resistances can be calculated by:", "type": "Document"}}
