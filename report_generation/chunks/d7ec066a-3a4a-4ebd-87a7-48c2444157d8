The inven- tors found that berbamine and its analogues are capable of inhibiting the entry of the viruses into host cells thereby protecting the cells from being infected. Mice infected with the virus particularly flavivirus were also found to have higher survival rate after treatment with the benzylisoqui- noline alkaloids. Accordingly, the present invention pro- vides effective compounds for treating and/or preventing flavivirus infection, particularly Japanese encephalitis virus infection, Zika virus infection and/or Dengue virus infec- tion.\n\n[0023] FIG. 2C shows the high-content images of A549 cells after pretreating A549 cells with indicated dose of berbamine for 1 h and infected with 50 MOI of ZIKV for 18 h, and a dose responsive curve of berbamine on ZIKV.\n\n[0024] FIG. 2D is a Western blot pattern showing the expression of JEV-NS1 in A549 cells which were pretreated with berbamine at indicated dose for 1 h and infected with -10 MOI JEV for 10 h, and the expression of JEV-NS1 in A549 cells which were pretreated with DMSO as control group.\n\n[0025] FIG. 2E is a Western blot pattern showing the expression of ZIKV-E in A549 cells which were pretreated with berbamine at indicated dose for 1 h and infected with ~10 MOI ZIKYV for 10 h, and the expression of ZIKV-E in A549 cells which were pretreated with DMSO as control group.", "type": "Document"}}
