The map- per component 416 also can generate and/or contain a map- ping of the respective optical signals and respective contro. signals to other items, such as respective barrier patterns, respective barrier pattern modes, respective display modes, etc.\n\nthe barrier control component 400 as desired to carry out operations of the barrier control component 400. It is to be further appreciated and understood that the communicator component 402, interface component 404, sensor component 406, etc., of the barrier control component 400 can each be included within the barrier control component 400 (as depicted), can be a stand-alone unit, or can be incorporated within another component, and/or virtually any suitable com- bination thereof, as desired.\n\nThe barrier control component 400 can include a contro signal generator component 418 that can generate or produce different types of control signals, wherein a control signal of a plurality of available control signals can be generated and transmitted to the barrier component to facilitate switching of the barrier component between display modes, as more fully disclosed herein.", "type": "Document"}}
