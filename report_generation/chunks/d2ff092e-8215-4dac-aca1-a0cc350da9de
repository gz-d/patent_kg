The compensator has means for sensing an output signal at a passive component at an output of the regulator; means for generating a compensating signal based on a difference signal, said difference signal comprising a difference between a level of a reference signal for the regu- lator and the sensed output signal; and means for applying said compensating signal to said passive output component to reduce said difference between the level of the reference signal and the sensed output signal. The passive output com- ponent comprises a capacitor or an inductor depending on the of the\n\nReferring 17, battery supported power supplies are used for a variety of applications. Often a battery power supply must be regulated prior to being utilized in a system. For example, in an exemplary system 500 of FIG. 17, an AC power source may be obtained from an AC adaptor 510 which may be coupled, for example, to a public AC power grid. A battery 520 is also provided to provide a battery power source. Switches 512, 514, and 516 and charger regulator 530 may be provided to select AC power from the AC adapter 510 or battery power from the battery 520 to provide the power for the supply rail Vin 525. The switches may also be controlled to provide charging of the battery. The power supply rail Vin 525 may be provided to a number of voltage regulators 540, at least one of said voltage regulators comprising a voltage regulator in accordance with any of the examples of the inven- tion.", "type": "Document"}}
