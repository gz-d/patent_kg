The plurality of available optical signals can include, for example, a first optical signal 208 (e.g., transparent or 2-D-indicator optical signal) that can comprise a first light pattern, wherein the first light pattern (e.g., comprising 2 pixels) can comprise 2 bits of data, and wherein the 2 pixels can be respectively set (e.g., turned on to emit light, turned off so no light is emitted; set to a first wavelength to be a first indicator, set to a second wavelength to be a second indicator; etc.) to form the first light pattern resulting in the 2 bits of data being set to a specified data value (e.g., 00 (or 11)) to indicate that video content is 2-D content; a second optical signal 210 (e.g., 3-D stereoscopic-indicator optical signal) that can comprise a second light pattern, wherein the second light pattern (e.g., comprising 2 pixels) can comprise 2 bits of data, and wherein the 2 pixels can be respectively set form the second light pattern thereby resulting in the 2 bits of data being set to a different specified data value (e.g., 10) to indicate that video content is 3-D stereoscopic content; and a third optical signal 212 (e.g., 3-D autostereoscopic-indicator optical signal) that can comprise a third light pattern, wherein the third light pattern (e.g., com- prising 2 pixels) can be respectively set to form the third light pattern thereby resulting in the 2 bits of data being set to still another specified data value (e.g., 01) to indicate that video content is 3-D autostereoscopic content. Itis to be appreciated and understood that, while 2 pixels and 2 bits of data are being employed in this example system 200, the disclosed subject matter is not so limited, as, in accordance with", "type": "Document"}}
