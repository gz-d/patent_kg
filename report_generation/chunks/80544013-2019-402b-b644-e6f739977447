The thermoelectric device 700 (i.e. sensor 700) is also advantageous because the sensor has a high sensitivity value.\n\n[0191] Reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour in any country in the world.\n\nbe formed by a similar process as the method 300. FIG. 9 illustrates a method 900 of forming a thermoelectric sensor 700 (ie. thermoelectric device 700). The method com- mences at step 902. Step 902 comprises providing a first flexible substrate and a second flexible substrate. The sub- strates are preferably cleaned prior to step 902 by a suitable cleaning process. Step 904 comprises depositing a p type semiconductor element on the first substrate. The p type semiconductor element is deposited by a suitable process e.g. by thermal evaporation. The p type semiconductor element is formed as a thin film. Step 906 comprises depositing a n type semiconductor element on the second substrate. The n type semiconductor element may be depos- ited by a suitable process e.g. a thermal evaporation. The n type semiconductor element is formed as a thin film on the second substrate. Step 908 comprises attaching the p type and n type semiconductor element in a manner such that a portion of the p type element overlaps the n type element. Step 910 comprises depositing or forming an electrode on the first substrate and an electrode on the second substrate. Optionally the method can comprise step 910 that comprises", "type": "Document"}}
