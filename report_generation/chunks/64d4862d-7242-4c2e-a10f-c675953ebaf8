All the reagents and solvents are used as received without further purification. NMR data is recorded with a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz spectrometer or a Bruker Ascend AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer at room temperature. ESI-MS data is recorded with a Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (API-3200 Triple-Q MS/MS). Analytical HPLC (RPLC) is conducted on a Shi- madzu Prominence LC-20AT HPLC system, with a reversed-phase C18 column (Phenomenex Garmin 250x4. 60 mm, 5 m, 110 A). The photometric diode array (PDA) detector is applied to scan the absorption spectrum from 190-800 nm. Solvent A (H,O with 5% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) and solvent B (ACN (what %?) with 5% H,O and 0.01% TEA by volume) is used for a gradient elution at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The samples are eluted as follows: 100% H,O (0 min}\u201450% H,0+50% ACN (5 min)\u201450% H,0+50% ACN (7 min) \u4e00 100% ACN (10 min)\u2014100% ACN (13 min)\u2014100% H,O\n\n(15 min) all by volume. Platinum content is measured by an\n\nUS 2023/0024341 Al\n\nInductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) (PE Optima 8000).\n\n[0064] Unless otherwise specifically provided, all tests herein are conducted at standard conditions which include a room and testing temperature of 25\u00b0 C., sea level (1 atm.) pressure, pH 7 and all measurements are made in metric units. Furthermore, all percentages, ratios, etc. herein are by weight, unless specifically indicated otherwise. It is under- stood that unless otherwise specifically noted, the materials compounds, chemicals, etc. described herein are typically commodity items and/or industry-standard items available from a variety of suppliers worldwide.\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
