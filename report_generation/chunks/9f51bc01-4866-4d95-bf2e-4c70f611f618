Firstly, unique conversion of the color may be difficult. Different colors in a system may be converted into the same color of another system. For instance, consider Color A ,Color B ,and Color C in CMYK system, where (c 4, My. Yas Kg-(56 28 28 0). (cm mo ya koj-(390 0 28) and Ce. Me Ye, kw=(45 10 10 20). By using Expression (1), all Color A, Color B and Color C are converted into the same RGB color (1, g, b)=(112 184 184). The reason of causing this bias is because Expression (1) cannot support one-to- one mapping between CMYK and RGB.\n\n[0083] FIG. 4 is a circle-bar graph showing an example result of mixture of multiple colors in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n[0084] The inventors have, through their own research, trials and experiments, devised that color coding methods such as RGB, CMYK, and HSV color methods may be used in different applications. However, owing lack powerful integration frame, these methods may be difficult in some applications. For example, it may be difficult to: i) convert a RGB color into a unique CYMK color; ii) blend multiple HSV colors to paint a coloured object; or iii) print a target RGB color using a number of available CMYK colors.\n\n[0092] Secondly, it may be difficult to obtain a mixture of colors based on these expressions. For example, RGB, CMYK, and HSL/HSV systems do not support mixing of more than two colors, since there are no explicit merge functions or operations. For instance, giving three HSV colors expressed in Expression (2), it is not possible to know the resulting color of mixing these three colors. In addition, Expression (2) may be too complicated for value manipu- lations.\n\n[0085] In some example color systems, the color codes and color conversions may be specified as follows.", "type": "Document"}}
