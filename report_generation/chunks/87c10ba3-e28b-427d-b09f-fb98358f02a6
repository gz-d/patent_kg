In the follow- ing discussion, same or similar elements are designated with the same numeral references and redundant description will be omitted.\n\nThe present invention provides a device and a method that overcomes the above problems. Additionally or alternatively, the present invention is capable of continuously providing a constant force to the spine even after surgery without post- operative manipulation and until the spine is fully or substan- tially corrected.", "type": "Document"}}
