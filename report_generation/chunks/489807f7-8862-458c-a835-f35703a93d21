Such correction forces can take up the loss of correction occurred due to the viscoelastic behaviors of bio- logical tissues and effect a gradual correction of the deformity after the initial surgery. Conventional systems providing gradual or constant correction forces nevertheless require some form of repeated surgery or post-operative care, result- ing in longer hospitalization as well as patient inconvenience and discomfort.\n\nThe C-D spinal instrumentation system, introduced by Cotrel and Dubousset, employs a dual rod system interlinked. by a transverse traction device (DTT), and multiple hooks on each rod. The C-D system was intended to improve thoracic lordosis, preserve lumbar lordosis in the sagittal plane, improve correction in the frontal plane, and minimize loss of correction in case of hook migration or fracture at the bone- metal interface.\n\nOther methods in which a gradual but constant force is applied to the scoliotic spine include external halo traction, intermittent open lengthening and shape change from shape memory alloys. For example, the shape memory effect (SME) of nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy has been used to correct scoliosis in a goat model. However, the mechanical strength of SME was insufficient to fully correct spinal deformities.\n\nSimilar spinal correction systems include the Texas Scot- tish Rite Hospital (TSRH) Universal Spinal Instrumentation and Isola spinal implant system. The TSRH system, in addi- tion to obtaining a better correction of thoracic curves in the sagittal and coronal planes and maintaining lumbar lordosis, also provides rigidity of the implant against axial and tor- sional forces with its Crosslink\u2122 device.
