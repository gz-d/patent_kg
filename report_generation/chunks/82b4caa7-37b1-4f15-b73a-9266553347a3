The visual images 104 can be, for example, normal 2-D images, or enhanced 2-D images that can be processed to display 3-D content. The projector component 106 can provide (e.g., present, emit, project, etc.) the visual images 104 to the projector screen component 102. The pro- jector screen can be constructed ofa flexible material(s) (e.g., fabric, plastic film, etc.), semi-rigid material(s), or rigid mate- rial(s). The projector screen also can have a suitable coating (e.g., optical coating, diffusion coating, neutral coating, etc.) that can facilitate the presentation or reproduction of visual images 104 by the projector screen.", "type": "Document"}}
