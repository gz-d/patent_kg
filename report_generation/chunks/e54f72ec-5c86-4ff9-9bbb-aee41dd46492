FIG. 3B shows a schematic diagram of the steps to fabricate the thermoelectric device 100, 200. The method 300 is an example method of fabri- cating a thermoelectric device 100, 200 as described herein that is used as a wearable power source. The method 300 of fabricating a thermoelectric device comprises a plurality of steps. The method 300 commences at step 302. Step 302 comprises provides providing a clean, flexible substrate. The substrate may be polyimide sheet. Step 304 comprises disposing a plurality of n type semiconductor elements onto the substrate. The n type semiconductor elements comprise\n\ndisposed on a pipe and harvesting heat from the pipe to generate electricity. The thermoelectric device 200 has more thermoelectric modules (i.e. more semiconductor elements), than the construction of device 100. The thermoelectric device 200 can be used for high temperature power harvest- ing and for generating greater electricity. The device 200 is wrapped about an exhaust pipe 600. The thermoelectric device 200 generated 377.7 mV as measured by a multim- eter in the test conducted. FIG. 6A illustrates the device 200 generates a voltage and current by harvesting heat from the pipe 600. The device 200 is stable in the presence of large temperatures e.g. the device can be exposed to 84.8 degrees Celsius. FIG. 6B illustrates an infrared image the thermo- electric device 200 wrapped about an exhaust pipe. The pipe surface that contacts a face of the device 200 is the hottest. The heat from the pipe is harvested and converted to a current and a voltage by the thermoelectric device 200. The illustrated construction of the thermoelectric device 100 is fabricated to have a maximum output voltage of 250 mV and a power density of 8.4 mW/cm\u201d, at a temperature difference of 120 degrees Celsius. The thermoelectric device 200 may also be constructed to have similar efficiency and perfor-", "type": "Document"}}
