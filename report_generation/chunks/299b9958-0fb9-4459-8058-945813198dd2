The fabric includes three distinct layers: a hydrophobic nanofiber layer, a superhydrophilic nanofiber layer, and a conductive layer. As used herein, the term \u201csuperhydro- philic\u201d relates to materials that have an excess attraction to water such that there is a complete spreading of water or other polar liquids on the material surface. That is the contact angle of water droplets is approximately zero degrees within 2 seconds. The conductive layer is strategi- cally positioned between the hydrophobic and superhydro- philic layers, creating a sandwich structure of a multilayer composite. This configuration not only facilitates the real- ization of conductive and electronic sensing functions but also generates a surface energy gradient and a push-pull effect, guiding moisture unidirectionally. The fabric demon- strates remarkable sensitivity within a pressure range of 0 to 2 kPa.\n\n[0065] The conductive layer may be coated on one side of either the hydrophobic nanofiber layer or the superhydro- philic nanofiber layer. The fabrication of the hydrophobic and superhydrophilic nanofiber layers employs an electro- spinning method, ensuring precision and uniformity. Simi- larly, the conductive layer is created through electro spray- ing, contributing to its even distribution and functionality.\n\n[0066] The hydrophobic nanofiber layer includes high molecular weight hydrophobic polymers such as polyvi- nylidene difluoride or its copolymers, polyurethane, or poly- caprolactone. On the other hand, the superhydrophilic nano- fiber layer consists of high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers, including but not limited to polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl alcohol, nylon, or polyethylene glycol, and a metal salt.", "type": "Document"}}
