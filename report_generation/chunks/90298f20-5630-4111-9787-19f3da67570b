Also, metasurfaces may manipulate the fundamental properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves and hence may potentially revolutionize various EM-wave based applications such as optics, telecommunications, material engineering, quantum systems, etc. That said, inventors of the present invention have appreciated that simultaneous and independent con- trols over multiple ones of, and in particular all of, the fundamental properties of EM waves with high integrability and/or programmability is challenging. Inventors of the present invention believe that there is a need to provide a \u201cuniversal\u201d metasurface that enables simultaneous and inde- pendent controls some and preferably over all of the fun- damental properties of EM waves.\n\n[0128]\n\nInventors of the present invention have, through", "type": "Document"}}
