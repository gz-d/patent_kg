In operation, the TM,,, mode of the dielectric resonator antenna 100 can be excited to obtain a radiation pattern equivalent to a vertically electric-dipole-like radiation pat- tern; the TE,,,,,; mode of the dielectric resonator antenna 100 can be excited to obtain a radiation pattern equivalent to a vertically magnetic-dipole-like radiation pattern. The solid dielectric resonator element 102 can be made with K9 optical lass with a dielectric constant es of 6.85. The dielec- tric resonator antenna 100 in this embodiment is particularly adapted for 2.4 GHz WLAN applications (2.40 to 2.48 GHz).\n\n[0051] The measured total efficiencies of the prototype are given in FIG. 6. The matching levels (see FIG. 3) have been considered in the total measured efficiencies efficiencies. As shown in FIG. 6, the \u2018or the TE and TM ports are higher than 75% and 90%, respectively, at the 2.4-GHz WLAN band.\n\n[0052] The dielectric resonator antennas in the above embodiments are versatile, eflicient, and can provide a high antenna gain. The dielectric resonator antenna can be used in transmitting or receiving end to provide two linearly polar- ized omnidirectional radiation patterns with polarization diversity. This is useful for eliminating multi-path issues and increasing channel capacity, and is especially suited for indoor communications applications, such as in a Wi-Fi\n\n[0046] In one example, using ANSYS HFSS, a dielectric resonator antenna with the parameters (see FIGS. 1A to 1D) can be obtained: R=31 mm, H=20.5 mm, \u00a2,=6.85, R,=35\n\nradius R, and four radially extending portions extending\n\n[0044]\n\nlayer Referring\n\nto connect\n\nground plane 1 D, the feeding\n\nnow\n\nto\n\nFIG.\n\n1A to\n\nis\n\nis\n\nport).\n\nThe radiation\n\nrealized\n\nand\n\nor\n\nusing a\n\nsleeve\n\nUS 2021/0066816 A1\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\n4\n\n1.
