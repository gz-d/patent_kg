When ordinary 2-D content is displayed, the active parallax barrier can be totally, or substantially, transparent and have no effect on the projector screen, and, as a result, the ordinary 2-D content can e displayed without being degraded by the active parallax barrier. When 3-D content is displayed, the pattern on the active parallax barrier can be activated to become partially opaque, and different views of the 3-D images can be directed to their corresponding directions, based at least in part on the attern.\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\nThe subject disclosure relates generally to image displays, in particular, to automatic switching of a multi-mode projector display screen for displaying three-dimensional and two-dimensional images.", "type": "Document"}}
