Examples of biomolecules that cell pen- etrating peptides can deliver include, but are not limited to, plasmid DNA, oligonucleotides, nanoparticles, peptide- nucleic acid (PNA), siRNA, proteins, peptides and/or lipo- somes. Examples of cell penetrating peptides commonly used in the art include trans-activating transcriptional acti- vator (TAT), penetratin, etc. The modified protein of the present invention can include a cell penetrating peptide sequence.\n\nIn an embodiment, the modified protein comprising a mutation at an N413 position and three mutations E782K, N968K and R1015H further includes one or more mutations at the R245, N419 and/or R654 positions. In a particular embodiment, the modified protein comprises an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 4 or a homologue thereof that includes a mutation at N413, N419, R245 and R654 positions and three mutations E782K, N968K and. R1015H. In a preferred embodiment, the mutation at the N413, N419, R245 and/or R654 positions is a single amino acid substitution. In another preferred embodiment, the modified protein includes an alanine at the N413 position, and/or optionally at the N419, R245 and R654 positions.\n\nThe term \u2018nuclear localization sequence\u2019 used herein refers to amino acid sequence that facilitates the transport of proteins into the nucleus of a cell. Examples known in the art include SV40 large T antigen NLS and nucleoplasmin NLS. The modified protein of the present invention can include, alternatively or in addition to the cell penetrating peptide sequence, a nuclear localization sequence.", "type": "Document"}}
