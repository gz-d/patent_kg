Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that this manufacturing method is efficient, easy, and scalable.\n\n[0098] In an embodiment herein, the complex according to Formula I may include, for example, derivatives of salicy- laldehyde, acetoacetic acid, ethyl acetate, derivatives of 3-oxobutanoate (e.g. methyl 3-oxobutanoate and phenyl 3-oxobutanoate), platinum(II) drugs and complexes (e.g. cisplatin, nedaplatin, and heptaplatin), anhydride derivatives (e.g. succinic anhydride), halogen, and carboxyl acid deriva- tives. We note that the ligands herein may be directly- attached to the platinum(IV) atom (i.e., equatorial ligands), or may be attached to the atoms or moieties attached to the platinum atom (i.e., axial ligands).\n\n[0099] Without intending to be limited by theory it is also believed that an embodiment of the present invention may provide a method for treating cancer, a tumor, or an infection in a subject. In an embodiment herein such a method includes the steps of administering to the subject an effective dose of the platinum(IV) complex according to Formula I, and administering to the subject near-infrared radiation (NIR), typically the NIR is administered to the subject from the outside of the body while the platinum(IV) is located. and/or where the cancer, tumor, or infection is treated in Vivo.\n\na\n\n[0100] Thus, the cancer, tumor, or infection is typically sub-dermal location in the subject. In an embodiment herein, the sub-dermal location is from about 0.01 cm about 2 cm; or from about 0.05 cm to about 1 cm away from\n\nin\n\nto", "type": "Document"}}
