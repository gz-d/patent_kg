The first and simplest way is to excite a coil with an AC power source as shown in FIG. 6A. A second method is to use a multi-layer winding matrix structure as shown in FIG. 6B similar to that described in GB2389720A. However, in both cases, it has been pointed out (Liu, X.; Chan, P. W.; Hui, S. Y. R.; \u201cFinite element simulation of a universal contactless bat- tery charging platform,\u2019 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference 2005, APEC 2005, Volume 3, 6-10 Mar. 2005 Page(s): 1927-1932) that a central voltage sag phenomenon exists. In practice, a secondary module (or energy receiving element) is used to pick up the energy for charging the load. FIG. 7 shows that in one practical experimental setup, the rectified DC voltage picked up by a secondary module on the planar surface is not entirely uniform over the planar surface and in particular is reduced in the central part of the planar surface. This is known as central voltage sag phenomenon. This voltage sag increases as the surface area of the charging\n\nFIG. 2 shows another form of prior art inductive battery charging platform,\n\nFIG. 3 shows typical prior art planar windings as may applied for example to opposite sides of a printed circuit\n\nFIGS. 4A and 4B show respectively planar windings parallel planes and their use in a prior art battery charging platform,\n\nFIG. 5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit of the system FIG. 4B,", "type": "Document"}}
