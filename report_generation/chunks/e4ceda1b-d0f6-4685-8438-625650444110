The device of claim 1, wherein the metallic arrange- comprises a metallic coating at the tip.\n\n[0027] Some of the above embodiments have provided a pulsed electron source for electron microscopes. The elec- tron source can add femtosecond analysis capability to electron microscopes. By using pulsed laser and optical fiber tip, a highly coherent pulsed electron source can be achieved while avoiding alignment difficulties (associated with align- ing the energy source and the tip). The electron source can provide not only high spatial resolution but also femtosec- ond time resolution. In some embodiments, the electron source can be incorporated into a transmission electron microscope to boost temporal resolution to add femtosecond analysis capability (some molecular processes occur at a time scale of femtoseconds (107'> seconds)).\n\n6.
