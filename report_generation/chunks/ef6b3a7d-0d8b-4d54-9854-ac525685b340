FIG . 2G also shows that\n\nthe pretreatment of A549 cells or BHK - 21 cells with ber\n\nbamine markedly reduced JEV - induced cell death . These\n\ndata indicated that berbamine has inhibitory effect against\n\nboth JEV and ZIKV infection in host cells .\n\n[ 0082 ] Furthermore , as demonstrated in FIG . 1D , calcium\n\ninflux is required for the entry of JEV or ZIKV . The\n\ninventors further determined whether treatment of host cells\n\nFangchinoline\n\nwith berbamine can block the entry of these viruses . To\n\nevaluate this , A549 cells were pre - treated with berbamine\n\nfor 1 h , and were then infected with JEV for 80 min before\n\nfixation . Viral positive strand RNA hybridization was sub\n\nsequently performed to detect the RNA genome of JEV . The\n\nresults in FIG . 3A show that the positive strand JEV RNA\n\nwas only detected inside control cells , not in cells pretreated\n\nwith berbamine .\n\nH\n\n[ 0083 ] Also , A549 cells pretreated with or without ber\n\nbamine were incubated with ZIKV on ice for 1 h , and were\n\nthen incubated with warm medium at 37 \u00b0 C. for another 40\n\nmin before fixation , followed by anti - ZIKV envelope pro\n\ntein immunostaining . The results in FIG . 3B show that the\n\nintact ZIKV virus ( encircled in the figure ) was detectable on\n\nthe surface of virus infected cells pretreated with or without\n\nberbamine , whereas the intact ZIKV virus were highly\n\nconcentrated at the surface of virus infected cells pretreated\n\nwith berbamine , not the control cells , after cells were\n\nincubated at warm medium . Accordingly , these data dem\n\nonstrate that berbamine have inhibitory effect against the\n\nentry of ZIKV or JEV into host cells .\n\nNO2\n\n[ 0084 ] The inventors further tested three analogues of\n\nE6 berbamine\n\nberbamine including isotetrandrine , fangchinoline , and E6\n\nberbamine to see if they have anti - infection effect against the", "type": "Document"}}
