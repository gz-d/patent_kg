A method, comprising:\n\ndetecting, by a set of light sensors, an optical signal, which is associated with a visual image that is part of video content, and is presented as a visual output from a con- trol region associated with a projector screen that is presenting the visual image, wherein the optical signal presents multiple bits of data that are indicative of a barrier pattern mode and a corresponding barrier pattern to use to process at least a portion of the video content, wherein a number of light sensors in the set of light sensors is equal to a bit number that indicates a total number of the bits of the data of the multiple bits of the data; 40 45\n\n25. The method of claim 22, further comprising:\n\nproviding the electrical power to at least one of a battery, the barrier component, or a processor associated with a barrier control component.\n\n26. The method of claim 25, further comprising:\n\nstoring the electrical power in the battery; and\n\ntransferring at a portion power to at least one of the barrier component, the projector screen, or the processor to facilitate powering at least one opera- tion being performed by at least one of the barrier com- ponent, the projector screen, or the processor.", "type": "Document"}}
