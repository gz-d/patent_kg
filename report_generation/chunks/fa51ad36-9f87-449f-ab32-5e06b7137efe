When a secondary winding is placed on the charging surface, only a single primary winding is excited to generate magnetic flux to charge the battery.\n\nSome embodiments of the invention will now be described way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:\n\nGS. 1(a) and (6) show (a) the direction of the flux lines in first prior art battery charging platform, and (b) a corre- sponding secondary device, \u4e2d\n\nGS. 2(a) and (5) show (a) the direction of the flux lines second prior art battery charging platform, and (b) a corre- sponding secondary device, ies]\n\nFIG. 3 shows one example of a single- or mu winding array for a charging platform based on windings, tiple layer hexagonal\n\nPreferably, a matrix switching array is provided for enabling a selected primary winding to be excited. When excited, a single primary winding may preferably provide sufficient magnetic flux to charge the battery.\n\nFIG. 4 shows exany les of rectangular or circular receiver\n\nIn preferred embodiments of the invention, means are pro- vided to detect the presence and location on the charging surface of the secondary winding.\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates the dimensional relationship between large receiver windings and smaller transmitter windings based on a square packing of circular windings,", "type": "Document"}}
