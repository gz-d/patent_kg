FIG. 10 shows the simulated and mea- sured reflection coefficients, whereas their corresponding input impedances are shown in the inset. With reference to the figure, the measured and simulated resonance frequencies of the rectangular DRA 12 are given by 1.91 GHzand 1.86 GHz, ively, with an error of 2.70%. For the impedance band- measured and simulated values are 17.6% and 15.8%, respectively. The resonance due to the solar cell is observed again in the measured result. Its resonance fre- quency slightly shifts from 2.25 GHz to 2.23 GHz due to the changes of the dielectric and excitation-strip loadings. The antenna gain of the transparent rectangular DRA 12 was also measured. It was found to be ~4.2 dBi around the resonance. The simulated and measured radiation patterns are shown in FIG. 11. As can be observed from the figure, the crosspolar- ized fields are weaker than the co-polarized ones by more than 25 dB in the boresight direction, showing that the rectangular DRA 12 has a very good polarization purity. FIG. 12 shows the measured output voltage and current using the same solar cell with R,=15 mm. With reference to the figure, the rectan- gular DR 16 does not increase the outputs of the solar cell, suggesting that the rectangular DR 16 can be used for appli- cations that do not require the focusing function. From the result, the focusing ability of the hemispherical DR 116 can be verified. Although the rectangular DR 16 does not provide the focusing function, its angular range for light reception is wider than its hemispherical counterpart, and the drop in its transparency above the solar cell is much smaller than the", "type": "Document"}}
