In detail, during the sliding window operation, the processor P applies a sliding window frame F with the step size of 5 ms (1 frame) across the training data set (16 ms, 3-frames).\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n35\n\nReferring to FIGS. 12A and 13, in the step S410: during a period of performing the 1D continuous movement by the different wearers, a plurality of 1D-continuous-movement training data sets in response to the different wearers are measured, by the receiving electrode portions RP, respec- tively. To be more specific, the step $410 further includes two steps $412, S414.\n\nReferring to the FIG. 12B, in the step $412: A reference slider is moved at a constant speed on a screen, in which the reference slider is moved from two positions on the screen. The position information of the two positions on the screen in the step $412 is also recorded. In detail, an experiment facilitator firstly shows a 600-pixel-long reference slider with its handle gradually moving in a constant speed (400 pixels/second) on the screen.", "type": "Document"}}
