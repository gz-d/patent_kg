The particle size spans too broadly a range of diameters. It is possible that this is because drops of the organic solution applied all over the surface of the ice template tend to flow and superpose as layers one over another. This creates inconsistent infusion of the solution into different parts of the ice template. Some of the drug precipitates inside pores of the ice to form smaller particles, but some of the drug precipitates on the ice surface, outside the to form bigger particles.\n\npores,\n\nof\n\nDec. 23, 2021\n\n[0008] Thus, there is a highly desirable need to propose methods or devices that can improve the ice-template method, so as to provide a possibility of producing nanod- tugs that have particle size variations within a narrower range, i.e. better particle size uniformity.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0009] Ina first aspect, the invention proposes a method of preparing nanoparticles of a pharmaceutical compound. comprising the steps of: applying a hydrophobic solution containing the pharmaceutical compound onto a surface of ice, the surface confined by walls around the surface; the confined surface having area of about 200 mm?; the ice having pores; applying a volume of 50 il to 150 pl of the solution onto the ice; the concentration of the solution being 1 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml; ventilating the surface of the ice to remove the solvent and to precipitate the compound inside the of the ice.\n\npores\n\n[0010] Pores means holes in the ice and include capillar- ies.", "type": "Document"}}
