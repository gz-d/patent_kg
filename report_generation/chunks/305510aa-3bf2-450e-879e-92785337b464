An electrical device, comprising:\n\nbody having a portion formed with a circumference extending about an axis;\n\n7. An apparatus, comprising:\n\nacap for an electrical device, wherein the cap is adapted to be removably fitted over and at least partly surround a body portion of an electrical device, the cap comprising: an integrally formed secondary winding to surround the body portion when present, the secondary winding being adapted to receive magnetic flux extending from a planar charging surface when present; and\n\narechargeable battery housed within the body;\n\nfirst connection circuit in connection with the recharge- able battery disposed within the body; and\n\nremovable cap adapted to fit over and at least partly surround the body portion, the cap including:\n\nintegrally formed secondary winding surrounding body portion about the axis, the secondary winding being adapted to receive magnetic flux extending from a planar charging surface;\n\nlayer of magnetic material situated such that when cap is removably fitted over the body portion, layer of magnetic material is disposed between secondary winding and the body portion of the elec- trical device for reducing current induced in the body of the electrical device;\n\nlayer of magnetic material disposed between the sec- ondary winding and the body portion for reducing current induced in the body of the electrical device; and\n\nsecond connection circuit for connecting the second- ary winding to the first connection circuit so as to charge the rechargeable battery in the body;\n\nwherein the cap is configured for placing in contact with the planar charging surface when present and to support the electrical device on the planar charging surface dur- ing charging of the electrical device; and\n\nwherein the cap is arranged to be in contact with the planar charging surface and to support the electrical device the planar charging surface during charging of the elec- trical device; and", "type": "Document"}}
