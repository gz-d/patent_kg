For example, it has been shown that the luminous flux\u2014LED power curves depend on the thermal resistance of the heatsinks. FIG. 11(c) and FIG. 11(d) show typical curves or LED systems using two different heatsinks for eight 3 W LEDs. The heatsink used for FIG. 11(c) is smaller than that \u2018or FIG. 11(d). For the example in FIG. 11(c), a 60% variation rom 1.2 W to 3 W for each device will lead to about 24% of ight variation. For the example of FIG. 11(d), a 60% variation of LED leads to 30% of light variation.\n\nBy using a suitable thermal design the power variation range of the LED load can be designed to fall within the region of the luminous flux\u2014LED power curve where the slope is small and the luminous flux is maximum or near maximum.\n\nAs a consequence of the requirement of only small capaci- tance in the proposed system, electrolytic capacitors can be eliminated from this design. Since the entire circuit consists of passive and robust components (such as power diodes, non-electrolytic capacitors and inductors) only and does not need extra control electronics, it features low-cost, high robustness and reliability.", "type": "Document"}}
