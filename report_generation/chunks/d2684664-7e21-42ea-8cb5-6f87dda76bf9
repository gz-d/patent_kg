Specifically, the alloy solution is placed in a sealed vessel and ultrasonicated in a heated water bath. According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the water bath is heated to a first temperature of approximately 65 to 85\u00b0 C., as long as it is substantially higher than the melting point of the bulk alloy. According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, the ultrasonication is conducted at a frequency of 40 kHz to kHz, and a power of 120 W for about 10 to 150 minutes. In one working example, the ultrasonication is conducted at a frequency of 40 kHz and a power of 120 W for about 30 minutes. In another working example, the ultrasonication is conducted at a frequency of 40 kHz and a power of 120 W for about 60 minutes. In still another working example, the ultrasonication is conducted at a frequency of 80 kHz and a power of 120 W for about 120 minutes. According to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, the alloy solution of step (a) is ultrasonicated at about 75\u00b0 C. for about 10-150 minutes until a suspension containing the present\n\nSn\u2014Bi\u2014In base alloy is produced.", "type": "Document"}}
