Specifically, the mixture in the reaction vessel is first sealed to prevent a flow of inert gas into the vessel whilst being frozen in, e.g., liquid nitrogen or dry ice for the mixture to reach a temperature below about 80 K. Once the mixture in the vessel has frozen, the vessel can be unsealed while being kept under vacuum for about 1 min to about 20 min, about 3 min to about 15 min, or about 5 min to about 10 min, allowing evacuation of the headspace. The vessel may also remain submerged in liquid nitrogen or dry ice during vacuum application. Next, the vessel may be sealed again under vacuum and removed from the liquid nitrogen or dry ice to allow the mixture to reach room temperature. This may in addition involve the use of a heat source to speed up warming of the mixture. As the mixture thaws, the dissolved gasses escape into the headspace. This process may be repeated for 10 times, 5 times, or 3 times to remove\n\nthe undesired dissolved gasses.\n\nUS 2024/0079591 Al\n\n[0052]\n\nAlternatively or additionally, the step\n\nof degassing\n\nmay involve heating, ultrasonic agitation, chemical removal of gasses, substitution with inert gas by bubbling, etc.", "type": "Document"}}
