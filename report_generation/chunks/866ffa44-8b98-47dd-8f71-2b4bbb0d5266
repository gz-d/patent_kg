A projector screen com- ponent can be employed to project or display visual images. In some implementations, the projector screen component can be or can include a rear projection screen. The projector screen component can be associated with a barrier component that can facilitate display of various types of video content, including ordinary 2-D content, 3-D stereoscopic content, and/or 3-D autostereoscopic content. The barrier component can be associated with (e.g., attached, adhered, or connected to), for example, a projector or display screen side of the\n\nIn accordance with additional or alternative embodiments, the signal transmitted by the projector component and/or received by the projector screen component can be an audio signal having a specified frequency (e.g., audio signal that is above or below the audio frequency range of humans (e.g., above 20 kHz or below 20 Hz)). The sensor component of the barrier control component can detect the audio signal associ- ated with the visual image as the visual image is being pro- jected or displayed on the projector screen component.
