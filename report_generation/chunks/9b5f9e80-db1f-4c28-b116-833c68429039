It is understood that the series inductance is not limited to a particular component because parasitic inductance of other parts of the circuit or system formed by wiring, printed-circuit board layout may also be addressed with the invention.\n\nV3VaitVa2 (8)\n\nBased on the embodiment of FIGS. 9 and 10, some other forms of the isolated and non-isolated embodiments of the means for compensating the series inductance and resistance a capacitive element, component, circuit or system can be derived and are shown in FIGS. 11 to 13.\n\nIn summary, provided is a method for reducing or sup- pressing series parasitic inductance and/or resistive effects that affect the frequency response of components, elements and/or circuits in an electronic circuit or system that exhibit capacitance. Noise generated by series parasitic inductance and/or parasitic resistance of the components, the physical orientation of the components, and/or the layout of compo- nents, devices and/or conductive tracks (board traces) on printed circuit boards within an electronic circuit or system is reduced. This is achieved by adding a voltage source in series with a part or component of the electronic circuit or system that exhibits capacitance, wherein said current source is arranged to deliver a compensating voltage of generally equal magnitude but generally opposite phase to parasitic voltage associated with said part or component.", "type": "Document"}}
