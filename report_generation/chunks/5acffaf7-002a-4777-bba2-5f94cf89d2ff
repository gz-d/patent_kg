The capacitive arrangement and the transmission line arrangement of the second circuit arrangement are arranged electrically in parallel. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement of the second circuit arrangement is grounded. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement of the second circuit arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a capacitor. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the second circuit arrangement is grounded. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the second circuit arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a curved transmission line. In some examples, the curved transmission line is a wavy transmission line with multiple bends.\n\n[0020]\n\nIn\n\nsome embodiments, the third circuit arrange-", "type": "Document"}}
