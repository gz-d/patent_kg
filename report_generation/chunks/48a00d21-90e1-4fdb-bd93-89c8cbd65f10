In still another aspect, the projector screen component 600 can include a selector com- ponent 614 that can select items, such as the identified signal as well as items selected by a user via the interface component 602. In yet another aspect, the projector screen component 600 can contain a mapper component 616 that can generate and/or contain a mapping of respective types of optical sig- nals (or other signals, such as audio signals) to respective types of video content, respective types or modes of barrier patterns, respective display modes, and/or respective types of control\n\ncan comprise a projector or display screen, such as a rear projection screen, that can be structured to receive visual images from a projector component (e.g., placed behind the projector screen component 600 in relation to a viewer(s) positioned in front of the projector screen component 600) and present the visual images to a viewer(s). The projector screen 604 can be constructed of a flexible material(s) (e.g., fabric, plastic film, etc.), semi-rigid material(s), or rigid mate- rial(s). The projector screen 604 also can have a suitable coating (e.g., optical coating, diffusion coating, neutral coat- ing, etc.) that can facilitate the presentation or reproduction of visual images by the projector screen 604. In other embodi- ments, the projector screen 604 can comprise a LCD, LED display, a combination LCD-LED display, a plasma display (e.g., plasma display panel (PDP)), a DLP display, a CRT display, or other type of projection or display screen that can", "type": "Document"}}
