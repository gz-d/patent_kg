For example, the synthesized videos can be rendered from distorted colour/depth videos from neighboring real views (left and right) in the practical applications. Preferably, the synthesized video file is created by processing the video file containing the video at the real viewpoints.\n\n[0018] Preferably, processing the reference video file and the synthesized video file further includes: processing the weighted temporal gradient layers associated with the origi-\n\n[0008] Preferably, determining an extent of flicker distor- tion of the synthesized video file based on the comparison\n\n[0001]\n\nThe invention relates to\n\nvideo\n\ndetermi-", "type": "Document"}}
