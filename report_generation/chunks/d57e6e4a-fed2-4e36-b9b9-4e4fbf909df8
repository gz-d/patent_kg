For example, the one or more processors are arranged to determine a first amplitude of the first photoacoustic signal and a second amplitude of the second photoacoustic signal; and apply the first and second amplitudes to the flow model.\n\n[0023] In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, the flow model is an exponential decay model.\n\n[0024] In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, the flow model relates the first and second amplitude with flow speed.\n\nby:\n\nF; F; \u5403 = 2Ha2 Pit 2Ha2 Pi Ae Cathy 1 Fikes Fibes\n\nwhere Pi is the first amplitude, P, is the second amplitude, Fi and F, are optical fluences associated with the first and second laser pulses, Ha and Lu are the optical absorption coeflicients associated with the first and second laser pulses, A, Tu, and b are coeflicients independent of the flow, dt is a time delay between the first and second laser pulses, v is the flow speed.\n\n[0025] In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, the system further includes a photoacoustic imaging or sensing appa- ratus having a probe arranged to transmit the first laser pulse and the second laser pulse to the sample. The photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus may include the one or more processors, or at least part of the one or more processors. The probe is arranged to transmit the first and second laser pulses in such a way that the first and second laser pulses have a\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\ntime difference in the order of nano-seconds, in the order of micro-seconds, in the order of milli-seconds, etc. In one example, the first wavelength of the first laser pulse and the second wavelength of the second laser pulse are isosbestic wavelengths, e.g., for blood.", "type": "Document"}}
