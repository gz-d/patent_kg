Accordingly, itis intended by the appended claims to cover all such alternative aspects as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n\nvoltage range. For example, when the AC adaptor 110 is being utilized the nominal input voltage level of Vin 125 may high compared to the battery voltage supply. However when the power supply system is supported by the battery, the mini- mum input voltage level may be as low as that provided by the battery power supply. The voltage regulators 140 convert the voltage level of the rail Vin 125 to the necessary voltages required by battery supported power system loads such as processor, chipsets, double data rate (DDR) memory and. graphics cards. For example as shown in FIG. 17 the voltage regulators 540 are used to provide a number of regulated power supply rails. The number, types, and output voltage levels of the regulators shown in FIG. 17 are merely exem- plary and may vary depending upon a user\u2019s application and needs. One exemplary type of regulator is a general switching voltage regulator where Metal Oxide Silicon Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is used as power control switch. In one exemplary example the voltage regulators may be \u201cbuck\u201d voltage regulators. Buck or \u201cstep-down\u201d voltage regulators are regulators that are generally known to have an output voltage that is lower than an input voltage. Exemplary voltage regulators use controllers such as the Intersil ISL88550A, Maxim MAX8743 and the Texas Instrument TPS51116. The exemplary voltage regulators have a common feature that two auxiliary +5V power supply voltages are needed to support drive circuitry and control circuitry operations in the control-\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n1.
