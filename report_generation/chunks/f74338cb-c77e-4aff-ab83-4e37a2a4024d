A planar complementary antenna, comprising: substrate;\n\n[0074] The antennas and antenna arrays as provided in the above embodiments have excellent electrical parameters such as wide operating bandwidth, low back radiation, and are stable in gain and radiation pattern shape over the frequency bandwidth. In particular, the wide operating band- width makes it highly attractive for the development of various kinds of indoor and outdoor base station antennas for modern cellular communication systems. The antenna has a simple structure and therefore can be made cheaply. The antenna can be used as a basic element in the design of low-cost high-performance antenna arrays with different gain and beam widths. The above embodiments have pro- vided a planar complementary antenna that includes a planar dipole antenna and a loop antenna. Various feed networks, e.g., balun networks, differential input networks, etc., can be used to excite the antenna. The planar complementary wideband has low back radiation, stable gain, and a stable radiation pattern shape. The antenna embodiments disclosed have one or more of the following advantages: small size, wide bandwidth, good electric performance, low fabrication and simple structure.\n\na planar dipole antenna arranged on the substrate;\n\na loop antenna arranged on the substrate and operably connected with the planar dipole antenna; and\n\na feed network for connection with a feed source, the feed network being operably connected with the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna for feeding an electrical signal from the feed source to the planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna so as to form an electric dipole at the planar dipole antenna and a magnetic dipole at the loop antenna.\n\n2. The planar complementary antenna of claim 1, wherein planar dipole antenna and the loop antenna are both arranged on a first side of the substrate.", "type": "Document"}}
