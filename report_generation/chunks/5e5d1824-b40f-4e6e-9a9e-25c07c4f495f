Amethod according to claim 4 wherein said vapor is fed said feed conduit with a carrier gas.\n\nFIG. 4 is a plot showing the concentration of sulfur atoms (y axis) as a function of depth (x axis) into a silicon sample in the following example. In this example a negative voltage of 15 kV is applied to the sample holder for a period of one hour. The negative voltage was applied to the sample holder 6 as pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz and with the pulses having a duration of 250 ts. The voltage was then increased to a negative voltage of 25 kV, again pulsed as before, for a further two hours. Sulfur was evaporated from the solid state in the evaporation chamber 17 and fed through feed conduit 4 using argon as the carrier gas. FIG. 4 shows the resulting sulfur distribution using X-ray spectroscopy and shows measured results contrasted with simulated analog results (obtained using TRIM software) without carrier\n\n6. A method according to claim 4 wherein a wall of said evaporation chamber is connected to a neck through which vapor escapes to said feed conduit, wherein the neck has an entrance area and the wall has an internal wall area, the entrance area being relatively small compared to the sum of the internal wall area and the entrance area, and wherein the internal diameter dimension of the feed conduit is smaller than its length dimension.\n\n7. The method according to claim 6 wherein the sum of the internal wall area and the entrance area is in a ratio greater than 4 with the entrance area.\n\n8. The method according to claim 6 wherein the length dimension of said feed conduit is ina ratio greater than 4 with internal diameter dimension of said feed conduit.\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n9. A method according to claim 1 wherein said implanta- material is gaseous.\n\n1. A method for performing plasma-based ion implantation comprising:", "type": "Document"}}
