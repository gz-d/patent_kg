The functional groups may be identical or different from each other. Preferably, the coupling agent includes an alkyl compound having a 6C carbon chain with different functional groups arranged on each end of the carbon chain. More preferably, the 6C alkyl compoun includes a hydroxyl group and a sulfhydryl group on each end of the compound. Most preferably, the coupling agent is 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH).\n\n[0056] A sample solution containing the target substance 112 and a reference solution may be added to the compart- ments 106A and 106B, respectively. The solutions may be added to the compartments with a predetermined volume. Preferably, the volume added to the compartments may be minimal, such as 1-2 mL. Depending on how the front side of the substance selection structure 104 is oriented (i.e. whether the side with the plurality of receptors is oriented towards the left or right end of the detector), the sample solution may be added to the compartment 106A or 106B through the inlets 108. In this example, the plurality of receptors is oriented towards the left end of the detector and therefore the sample solution 107A is added to the compart- ment 106A whereas the reference 107B is added to the compartment 106B.\n\n[0063] The MCH 206 on the one hand may form a gold-sulphur bond with the gold nano-layer 204 through the sulfhydryl group thereby allowing itself to accommodate on the membrane 202. On the other hand, the MCH 206 may form a covalent bond with the receptors 208 through the hydroxyl group such that the receptors are bridged/anchored. to the membrane 202.", "type": "Document"}}
