As referred to herein, such solar energy collection antennas can be called green antennas, in that, according to aspects, the disclosed embodiments can function as a communications antenna while generating from solar\n\nFor instance, according to various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, both single-element 102 SPA and ground plane 108 can advantageously reflect incident light to one or more appropriately positioned solar cell(s) to increase output voltage ofa solar power generating system. According to an aspect, SPA 100 can be optimized at a frequency of interest (e.g., 2 GigaHertz (GHz)). In addition, according to an aspect, SPA 100 can be fabricated with approximate dimensions of L (110)=100 millimeters (mm), W (112)=54 mm, h (114)=18 mm, t (116)=1.5 mm, Lo (118)=21.5 mm, and L, (120)=11.9 mm.\n\nemploy suspended plate antenna (SPA) arrays fabricated or otherwise placed on grounds (e.g., concave grounds) that can provide a light focusing effect. As an illustrative example, an L-shaped wire can be used as an efficient excitation probe for a C-figured loop antenna. For instance, a low profile (approxi- mately 0.1 \u5165 ,) L-probe-fed suspended patch antenna (SPA), where i, is the wavelength in free space, can provide a very wide impedance bandwidth of more than 35%, with stable radiation patterns across the passband. As a further example, an SPA element can be excited in its fundamental broadside transverse magnetic (TM,,) mode by an L-probe. In addition, such SPA arrays can advantageously provide a low profile, lightweight, and ease of excitation and tuning, in addition to increase in\n\nExemplary Solar Energy Collection Antennas", "type": "Document"}}
