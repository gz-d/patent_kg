The prior values indicate the probabilities of the time-series data starting from the corresponding hidden states. The transition matrix indicates the transition probabilities between any two hidden states. The Gaussian emissions indicate the probabilistic associations between the observed time-series data and the hidden states. In the previous EMHMM approach (Chuk et al., 2014), the hidden states corresponded to the regions of interest (ROIs), the emissions were the eye fixation locations, and the emissions in an ROI were represented as a 2-D Gaussian distribution (See FIGURE 1a).\n\nIn contrast to a standard HMM, a switching HMM (SHMM) contains two levels of hidden state sequences; the low-level hidden state sequence models the temporal pattern of the time-series data following a standard HMM, while the high-level hidden state sequences indicate the transitions between the HMM parameters used by the low-level hidden state sequence. Formally, Z,; \u20ac {1,...,K} are the low-level hidden states, and sa \u20ac {1,...,S} the high-level hidden states, and x,; the observations, where 7 indexes the sequences and f indexes time. Both the high-level state sequence and the low-level state sequence are 1*-order Markov chains. The prior probability and transitions of the low-level hidden state depends on the current high-level state,\n\nP(Sn) = P(Sna) M2, P(sn,e| Snt-1) (1)\n\nP(Zn|Sn) = P(Zn1 Sn) Te D(Zn.t| Znt-1v Snt)> (2)\n\nT,, ls the length of the n-th sequence.
