It was found that KKH-SaCas9-HF had enhanced targeting specificity and significantly reduced the number of off-target sites (FIG. 5A) whilst increasing on- target cleavage frequency at four canonical PAM sites (FIG. SA and FIG. 5B). With reference to FIG. 5C, KKH-SaCas9- HF significantly reduced the number of off-target sites compared to the SaCas9 variant with mutations of E782K, N968K and R1015H.\n\nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n<160> NUMBER OF SEQ ID Nos: 180\n\n<210> <211> <212> <213> <220> <223> SEQ ID NO 1 LENGTH: 1086 TYPE: PRT ORGANISM: Artificial Sequence FEATURE: OTHER INFORMATION: Synthesized\n\n<400> SEQUENCE: 1\n\nIle Leu Gly Leu Asp Ile Ile 10 Gly Lys Arg Asn Gly 1 Thr Ser Val 15\n\nGly Ile 20 Tyr Gly Asp Tyr Glu Arg Asp Val Ile Ala Gly\n\nval Phe Glu Asn Glu Asn Asn 40 Arg Lys Arg Arg\n\nLys Ala Leu 50 Gly Arg Lys Arg Arg His Arg\n\nVal Phe Asn Leu 75 Leu 70 Arg Lys Asp Thr\n\nSer Glu Leu Ser Ile Asn Pro Tyr Ala Arg Val Lys Leu\n\nGln Glu Glu Glu Phe 105 Leu Ala Ala Leu 100 Ser Lys Leu Leu 110\n\nval Asn Val Asn Glu Val 120 Lys Arg His 115 Arg Gly Glu\n\nGly Asn Glu Thr Glu Gln Ile 130 Leu Ser Lys 135 Ser Arg 140 Ser Lys Ala\n\nGlu Glu val 150 Ala Glu Gln Leu Glu 155 Leu Leu 145 Lys Tyr Leu Lys Lys 160\n\nAsp Gly Glu Val Arg Ser Ile Asn Phe 165 Gly Arg 170 Lys Ser Asp 175 Tyr\n\nval Glu Ala 180 Lys Lys Gln Leu Leu Lys Val Gln Ala 185 Lys Tyr His Gln 1380\n\nGln 195 Phe Ile Thr 200 Ile Leu 205 Leu Asp Ser Asp Tyr Leu Glu Thr Arg\n\n5\n\nSer\n\nGin\n\n65", "type": "Document"}}
