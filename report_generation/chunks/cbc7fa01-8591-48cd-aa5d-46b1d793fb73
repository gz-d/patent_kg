However, there may still be some variations and the use of a three or four layer structure may provide a still more uniform flux distribution as described in the following embodiments.\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n12\n\nThe following cmbodimcnt is a structure comprising three layers of planar winding arrays,\n\nThis winding structure can generate magnetomotive force (mmf) of substantially even magnitude over the energy transfer surface. Each winding array consists of a plurality spiral windings cach of which are of an hexagonal shape. A spiral winding arranged in a hexagonal shape is shown in Fig.14, For simplicity, it will be represented as a hexagon as shown in Fig.15. A plurality of hexagonal spiral windings can be arranged as an array as shown in Fig.16. These windings can be connected in parallel, in series or a combination of both to the electronic driving circuit. If a current passes through each spiral winding pattem, a magnetomotive force (mmy), which is equal to the product of the number of tums (N) and current (J) (i.e. NJ), is generated. Fig.17 shows two spiral winding pattems adjacent to each other and the per-unit mmf plot over the distance (dotted line) can be linearized as shown jn Fig.18. It can be seen that the mmf distribution over the distance is not uniform. The maximum mmf occurs in the center of the hexagonal pattem and the minimum mmf\n\noccurs in the edge of the pattern.\n\nFig.19 shows three adjacent windings. The maximum mmf\n\nis labeled", "type": "Document"}}
