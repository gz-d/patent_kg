In other words, with the use of the elastomeric layer, on the one hand, the materials from the battery (e.g. water, ions, etc.) may be difficult to move to the external environment; and on the other hand, external materials may also be difficult to move into the battery. This blocking feature may be advan- tageous as the electrochemical performance of the battery may not be easily deteriorated owing to the loss of battery materials such as water or the entry of external materials that could cause damage to the battery structure during opera-\n\n[0162] The second crosslinked structure may be optionally or additionally defined by the plurality of polymer chains o the second polymeric material 202 that form a physica\u2019 crosslink between each adjacent pair of polymer chains o the second polymeric material 202. The physical crosslink may include at least one hydrogen bond that is formed at a bonding site 208 between the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202.\n\n[0163] In one example, the physical crosslink may include a second crosslinking agent 210 such as ethylene glycol (EG), which forms at least one hydrogen bond with each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material 202 or PAAm. The second crosslinking agent may provide additional linkages between each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the second polymeric material which may in turn further strengthen the second crosslinked structure.\n\n[0155] The detailed structural arrangement of the electro- lyte 106 will now be described. With reference to FIG. 2A, the electrolyte 106 comprises a hydrogel 200 and a poly- meric layer 201 forming at least one crosslinked structure with the hydrogel, thereby substantially encapsulating the hydrogel.", "type": "Document"}}
