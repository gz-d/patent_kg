The system 200 can be or can comprise a SDSR that can form, emulate, and/or function as diode bridge, but with significant reduction in conduction loss as compared to conventional diode bridges or synchro- nous rectifiers. In accordance with an aspect, the system 200 can comprise switch 202 (M1 in FIG. 2) and switch 208 (M4 in FIG. 2), which can be associated with a first conducting path, and switch 206 (M3 in FIG. 2) and switch 204 (M2 in FIG. 2), which can be associated with a second conducting path, wherein the first conducting path and second conducting path can be connected to a power source 210 (e.g., AC power source) that can produce a desired input power signal. The system 200 also can include an SDGD subsystem that can comprise SDGD components 212, 214, 216, and 218, which can be respectively associated with (e.g., electrically con- nected to) switch 202, switch 204, switch 206, and switch 208, to facilitate controlling switching of the respective switches in response to the input voltage signal. In another aspect, switch 202 can include body diode 220, switch 204 can include body diode 222, switch 206 can include body diode 224, and switch 208 can include body diode 226, wherein the arrangement of the switches 202, 204, 206, and 208, and thus, the body diodes 220, 222, 224, and 226 in the circuit can be such that the body diodes 220, 222, 224, and 226 can be structured and can inherently function as a bridge- rectifier, including during initial start-up of the SDSR (e.g.\uff0c prior to the rectified DC voltage providing at least a portion of the desired power to the switches of the SDSR).
