The gRNA may be ligated into a vector, such as a commercially available vector or a vector prepared and synthesized in a laboratory. A person skilled in the art would appreciate the appropriate vector for carrying the gRNA molecule of the invention, and the conditions for inserting the gRNA mol- ecule into the vector. The presence of the gRNA and the modified Cas9 protein provides suitable conditions for alter- ing the target gene in that particular cell.\n\nThe term \u2018affinity tag\u2019 as used herein facilitates the purification of recombinant modified proteins, for example GST, FLAG or hexahistidine sequences. The term \u2018fusion base editor protein\u2019 as used herein refers to proteins that enable the direct conversion or editing of bases.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the modified protein with a mutation at the N413 position and at least one additional mutation at the R245, N419 and/or R654 positions decrease nuclease activity at one or more sites on a target DNA molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the sites are off-target sites. Preferably, the mutation changes the wild-type amino acid to alanine.\n\nThe modified SaCas9 protein of the present invention is derived from an isolated SaCas9 protein. The isolated SaCas9 protein may be commercially available or artificially synthesized. The isolated SaCas9 protein is then subject to amino acid modification particularly at the N413 position, under suitable conditions, to produce the modified SaCas9 protein as described above. The modified SaCas9 protein may be provided in a kit which is suitable for altering the", "type": "Document"}}
