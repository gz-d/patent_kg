The transverse traction member can be connected between the support member and a vertebra of the spine directly or via another anchor member. The transverse traction member can be formed to provide an independent correction force of a constant or substantially constant value. For example, the transverse traction element can comprise a superelastic or pseudoelastic material or other similar materials. In one exemplary embodiment, the independent correction force generated by the transverse traction member is capable of correcting the spinal deformities without using a superelastic support member. In another exemplary embodiment, the independent correction force generated by the transverse traction member can be used to reinforce, reduce, terminate, or otherwise adjust the correction force generated by the support member. Exemplary transverse traction members can include, but are not limited to, superelastic spring members, adjustable cylinders, internal motors, gear boxes, and the like. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the trans- verse traction member and the anchor member are also within", "type": "Document"}}
