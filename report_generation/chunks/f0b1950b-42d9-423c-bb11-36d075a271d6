Eachn device was constructed by the coating of PTFE film with a thickness of 13.4 um on ITO glass substrate with a size of 30x30 mm\u201c using drop-casting method, and then the glass slide was heated at 120\u00b0C for 15 mins to remove all solvent. The tiny Al electrode was assembled onto the PTFE to form a drain electrode. Intriguing and unexpected results can be obtained when individual droplets impinge on the surfaces of as-fabricated devices, which PTFE surfaces have been loaded with sufficient charges, either by continuous droplet impinging or ion-injection. Please also see Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 2a, four droplets, released from a height of 15 cm and with a volume of lo HL, can light up 400 commercial LEDs. Focusing an individual TIDE-G indicates that the open circuit output voltage, short circuit current and charge are measured at 1/0 V, 410 HA and 59 nC, respectively. Please see Figs. 2b, 2c and Fig. Accordingly, the improvements are ~350, ~4000 and ~/60 folds, respectively, higher than those without the use of transistor-like design, i.e., the control device based on TENG. Please see Figs. to 8b. To further verify the improvement and the maximum power output, the output characteristics under various load resistances were also measured. With the load resistance increasing from 1 KQ to 100 MQ, the output voltage varies from 0.45 V to 170 V and the output current decreases from 410 yA to 1.55 uA. The maximum power density is 69.8 W/m* when the load resistance is 33.2 KQ. Please see Fig. 9. The power density is three orders of magnitude higher than that of its counterparts. Referring to Fig. 10, wnen being kept under a humidity of 40 RH% for 30 days, the device exhibits no notable decay in the output, with measured charge stabilized at ~49 nC. Further tests were conducted to verify the practical application of TIDE-G in that a 10 UF capacitor was charged through a typical full-wave rectifier under continuous drop impinging.
