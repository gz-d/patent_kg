In this example. for the transmitter side, a microwave signal generator (Agi- lent E8267D) is adopted to generate a monochromatic wave with a frequency f,=23.5 GHz to feed the universal meta- surface antenna 400. The modulated waves with temporal- variant amplitude and phase properties (information) are directly generated and launched into free space by the universal metasurface antenna 400. Random binary bit streams with different modulation formats (QPSK, 8PSK, and 16QAM) are generated and mapped to the correspond- ing STC films in FPGA. For the receiver side, a linearly polarized diagonal horn antenna connected to a vector signal analyzer (VSA, Keysight N9041B) is adopted to receive and demodulate the propagating wave from the universal meta- surface antenna 400. The received digital messages can be recovered by the VSA, which provides the performance of the real-time constellation diagram, eye diagram, signal noise ratio (SNR), and EVM. In this example, the distance between the universal metasurface antenna and the received horn antenna is about 1.2 m. The modulation frequency fy, is set as 0.5 MHz, and the switching speed of the PIN diodes is 10 MHz. For the multiplexing wireless communication experiment, the universal metasurface antenna 400 gener- two channels in different directions\n\nates\n\nindependent\n\n(FIG.\n\n49).
