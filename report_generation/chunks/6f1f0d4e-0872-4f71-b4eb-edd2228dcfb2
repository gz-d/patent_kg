From the refinement results, the pristine NCM811 material possesses equivalent TM-O bond-length of 1.959 A. As for PGE-NCM811, four TM-O bonds, which lie in the rectangle section of the octahedron, contract to 1.947 A. The other two TM-bonds along the symmetric axis of the octahedron expand to 2.036 A. These PDF results suggest an elongated shape of the octahedrons from averaging the local structures of PGE- NCM811 (FIG. 15a inset). Such distortion may especially occur in the grain surface area within 20 nm depth, because the Ni atoms out of this range own the same oxidation state as the pristine material (see FIG. 1). Consequently, the primary grains of PGE-NCM811 are surrounded by the surfaces with elongated octahedra, forming a three-dimen- sional C2/m-type distorted network inside the secondary particles (FIG. 15c).\n\nEnhanced Cycling Stability and Rate Capacity of PGE-NCM811\n\nThe pristine NCM811 and PGE-NCM811 materi-\n\n[0049]", "type": "Document"}}
