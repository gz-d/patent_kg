In this embodi- ment, the precoder device is a delay-line analogue precoder which operates as an arbitrary digital linear precoder.\n\n[0049] At the receiver end, the ADC processes the received signals including multiple sub-channel compo- nents, one at a time, and according to the order of the components in the aforementioned queue, with a substan- tially constant processing time. Preferably, each of the sub-channel signals at the transmitter end is introduced with an incremental time delay with a predetermined time dif- ference between adjacent, sub-channels, such that the mul- tiple sub-channels may be processed one at a time, and the incremental delays may ensure that the next sub-channel signal does not reach the receiver end when the previous one is still under processing by the ADC. In some embodiments, the time difference between the sub-channels may be con- stant.\n\n[0058] In this example, the precoder device 400 further comprises a universal precoder 402 and a plurality of analog permutation switches 404 both arranged to process each of the plurality of sub-channels in the signal at the transmitter end.\n\n[0059] In an example digital implementation, the universal digital precoder may be separated into two parts, a universal precoder U(z) and a permutation matrix M. In other words, an arbitrary linear precoder in (2) may be factorized into the following matrix product\n\nGZ)=M-C-UG) (9)\n\nwherein U(z) s a linear precoding matrix with dimensions of KxK, where K denotes a total number of sub-channels of the signal; C is a rectangular matrix with dimensions of PxK, where P denotes a sample cate of sub-channel analogue signals; and M is a square permutation matrix with dimen- sions of PxP.\n\n[0050] Alternatively, the incremental delay time At may match with other components in the receiver system at early stage in the receiver.", "type": "Document"}}
