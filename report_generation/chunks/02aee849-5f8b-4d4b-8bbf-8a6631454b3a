The metallic arrangement may be made from chromium (Cr), gold (Au), or tungsten (W).\n\n[0013] In accordance with a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for producing a device for providing electrons. The method includes forming an optical fiber with a tip and arranging a metallic arrangement at the tip. The metallic arrangement is arranged to be excited by an energy source to emit electrons or electron beams. The device for providing electrons may be the device of the first aspect.\n\n[0005] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the metallic arrangement comprises a metallic coating at the tip. In one embodiment of the first aspect, the metallic arrangement comprises a plurality of layers of metallic coating at the tip. The plurality of layers of metallic coating can be of the same metallic material or of different metallic materials.\n\n[0014] In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, forming an optical fiber with a tip comprises melting a portion of the optical fiber to form the tip. The melting of the portion of the optical fiber may be performed using laser. In one embodi- ment of the fifth aspect, forming an optical fiber with a tip further comprises tensioning the optical fiber during the melting of the portion of the optical fiber. In some embodi- ments the tension applied may be constant; in some other embodiments the tension applied may be adjustable (in- creasing or decreasing).", "type": "Document"}}
