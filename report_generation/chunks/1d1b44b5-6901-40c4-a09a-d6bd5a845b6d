The cells form the battery and the charging protection circuit ensures that the battery is charged in a specified manner. Fig.9 shows the functional block diagram of a battery pack. The input positive 902 and negative 904 terminals of the charging protection circuits are labeled as IN+ and IN-, respectively. The output positive 906 and negative 908 terminals of this circuit are named OUT+ and OUT-, re- spectively. OUT+ and OUT- are connected to the battery as shown in Fig.10. If the mechanical connector of the power adaptor is inserted into the charging socket of the electronic equipment, the equivalent block diagram 1000 is shown in Fig.10. Essentially, DC+ and DC- are con- nected to IN+ and IN-, respectively. [0020] According to a preferred embodiment of this in- vention, an energy receiving element in the form of a simple planar device is introduced to this battery pack structure so that this battery pack can be charged induc- tively by the planar charging platform of Fig.2 (which has the magnetic flux lines flowing into and out of the charging surface perpendicularly). Using a mobile phone as an example, the battery pack is usually accommodated in- side the mobile phone and is covered by the back cover of the mobile phone If a mobile phone is placed on the planar inductive battery charging platform of Fig.2, one side of the battery pack will face the charging surface of the charging platform. This side will be called the \"active side\" of the battery pack in this specification because it is closest to the charging surface of the charging platform and will be used for inductive charging purposes. There will be only the back cover (usually made of plastic) of the mobile phone between the active side of the battery pack and charging surface of the charging platform. In a first embodiment of the invention the energy [0021] receiving element consists of a winding 1", "type": "Document"}}
