The method of claim 15, wherein the additive includes least one of acid, metal salts, water soluble polymer, citrate sodium, polystyrene sulfonate, sodium dodecyl sul- (SDS), and cysteine.\n\n[0102] Any reference to prior art contained herein is not to be taken as an admission that the information is common general knowledge, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n17. The method of claim 16, wherein the metal salts includes cations and anions; the cations being selected from Cu**, Ni**, Co?*, Fe**, and Fe?*; the anions being selected from NO,7, 80,7\", CI\u2019, and Br-.\n\n1. A method for treating a surface of a metallic structure, the metallic structure being made of a first metallic material, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n(a) releasing metallic ions from the surface of the metallic structure; and\n\n18. The method of claim 16, wherein the water soluble polymer includes polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).\n\n(b) depositing a nano-structured metallic layer onto the surface of the metallic structure from the released metallic ions, wherein the nano-structured metallic layer includes uniform nanoparticles.\n\n19. The method of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticles nano-structured metallic layer form one or more metal nanostructures.\n\n20. The method of claim 19, wherein the morphologies metal nanostructures include at least one of nanospheres, nanospindles, nanoplates, nanopyramids, nanowires, nano- cones, nanoshuttles, and dendrites.\n\n2. The method of claim 1, wherein the surface of metallic structure is subjected to alternating electrochemical oxidation and reduction through a pulsed voltage or current waveform.\n\n21. The method of claim 12, wherein the electrolyte, upon completion of step (b), includes morphologies of nanopar- ticles of the first metallic material.\n\n3. The method of claim 2, wherein metallic atoms of the metallic structure are oxidized to metallic ions thereby releasing from the surface of the metallic structure during oxidation.", "type": "Document"}}
