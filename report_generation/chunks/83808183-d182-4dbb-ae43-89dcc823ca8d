The origin in the horizontal axis, 1.e., point (0.00), refers to the point of the energized magnetic core that is nearest to the workspace. The point (160.00) corresponds to position of a magnetic core opposite to the energized magnetic core. That is, this magnetic core and the energized magnetic core are on opposite sides of the workspace. The point (80.00) refers to the center of the workspace. That is, the size of the work- space is 160 mm.\n\n[0081] When the magnetic core (such as an iron core) is in the saturation state, its radius is proportional to the distance from its center point to the concerned position along its normal line in space. This proportional relationship directly affects the magnetic field strength generated by the magnetic core. The geometric parameters of core structure can be optimized based on the analysis results.\n\n[0082] As a result, under the optimized condition, the radius of the magnetic core is 38 mm. The length of the magnetic core is 537 mm. The cone radius of the magnetic core is 10 mm. The height of the core tip is 58 mm. The magnetic flux density of the single magnetic coil can gen- erate at 80 mm away from the cone tip is around 15.6 mT with 20 A current excitation. These numeral values are for illustrating purpose and may vary depending on specific system designs.\n\n[0083] With reference to Table 1 below, the magnetic field gradient is obtained by calculating the difference of mag- netic flux density at a measuring point with a spatial distance +0.02 mm. The magnetic field gradient at 80 mm is around 0.27 T/m with current excitation of 20 A. The measuring point refers to a distance relative to the origin. For example, the distance of Point 3 relative to the origin is 80 mm, which is the center of the workspace.\n\nTABLE 1", "type": "Document"}}
