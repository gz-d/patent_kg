The surface morphology and thickness of the metal-carbon composite were examined with AFM at a noncontact mode. The Raman spectra were obtained using the Renishaw inVia Raman microscope excited with a laser of a wavelength of 532 nm. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were measured using the Nicolet IN10 MX infrared imaging microscope.\n\nDefinitions\n\n[0089] Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d or variations such as \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccomprising\u2019\u2019, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
