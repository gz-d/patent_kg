How- ever, the content of the invention is not limited to the following embodiments. The technical personnel in this field may make various changes or modifications to the invention, and these equivalent forms are also within the limits of the claims listed in this application.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1. Fabrication of the biomimetic, nanofiber-based and directional moisture-wicking electronic fabric samples\n\n[0080] The fabrication process commences with the dis- solution and stirring of 3 g PVDF and 0.1 g carboxylic CNTs in a 16.9 g DMF/Acetone mixed solution (3/2, wt/wt) with the addition of 0.2 wt % LiCl. Using the electrospinning technique, a hydrophobic layer of CNT-modified PVDF (C-PVDF) nanofibers membrane is achieved. Subsequently, an MXene/CNTs conductive ink is electrosprayed onto the C-PVDF nanofibers. For the top layer, 2 g polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is dissolved and stirred in an 18 g DMF solution with 0.2 wt % SDS addition, and a hydrophilic PAN nanofibers membrane is electrospun onto the electrosprayed membrane. During both electrospinning and electrospraying processes, positive voltage and feeding rate of 25 kV and 0.05 mm min-1, respectively, are set. The tip-to-collector distance is maintained at 15 cm. The electrospraying time for the MXene/CNTs conductive ink varies for different samples (2, 6, and 10 h for sample-1, sample-2, and sample-3, respec-\n\na\n\ntively).\n\n[0081] The MXene/CNTs conductive ink is prepared by mixing carboxylated carbon nanotube (CNT) solution and Mxene nanosheet colloidal solution. LiF (1 g) is dissolved in 10 mL HCl (9 M), and Ti,AIC, powders (1 g) are gradually added into the LiF/HCI aqueous solution. The solution is moved into a Teflon autoclave for 24 h at 60\u00b0 C., followed\n\nAug. 8, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
