Refer- ring briefly to FIG. 27 (along with FIG. 21), illustrated is a diagram of example (e.g., typical) driving waveforms 2700 of Phase B fora resistive load in accordance with an aspect. The voltage Vey can be the input voltage of Phase C taking the low rectified voltage as reference zero (FIG. 21) and currenti, can be the current flowing through the switch 2110 (Ms). The current can commutate with a sharp slope. As a result, if there is not additional circuitry (e.g., additional control circuit) to facilitate turning the comparator CP, to an off state at the zero-crossing point, the comparator CP, can or may not respond quickly enough to turn the power switch 2110 (Ms) from an on state to an off state under such a fast current\n\nTurning to FIG. 26 (along with FIG. 21), FIG. 26 illustrates\n\na\n\nsteady-state\n\noperation.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nReferring briefly to FIG. 28 (along with FIG. 21 and FIG.\n\nRyo and R30, for use in the zero-crossing controller compo- nent 2800.
