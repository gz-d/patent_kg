In detail, the channel-wise gradient operation is performed on any two of the electrical output signals of each of the measurement frames of the each of the gesture samples X, so as to extract the channel-wise gradient feature set in response to the corresponding known microgesture.\n\nWhere the channel-wise gradient feature set dC(X) represented as: dC(X)=AV,,)' lt \u20ac{0, ... , N-1), G, j) \u20acP,}eRO\u00b0\u2122 and (i, j) represents the channel pairs in the gesture sample X.

Also, in some embodiments, a label- smoothing technique with the smoothing parameter (e.g., \u20ac=0.1) is performed during the training process. Thus, the generalizability of the ML model MLI is improved, and the oyer-fitting issue is avoided.\n\n1 7 t \u4e86 ka ; O) AM \u4e09\n\nWhere V; represents the output electrical signal measured by i\u201d channel (i.e., i\u201d receiving electrode portion RP); and VF represents the output electrical signal measured by \u8fd9 channel (i.e., j receiving electrode portion RP).
