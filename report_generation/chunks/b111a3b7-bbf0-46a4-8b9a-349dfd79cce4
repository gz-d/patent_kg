It is to be appre- ciated and understood that, in some embodiments, the pro- jector screen component 600 can include a mechanical com- ponent (e.g., projector screen comprising mechanical components), and in other embodiments, the projector screen component 600 can comprise mechanical components, elec- tronic components, and/or computer-related components. The projector screen component 600 can include all or a desired portion of the various components described herein in relation to FIG. 6 and the projector screen component 600.\n\nIn yet another aspect, the barrier component 500 can com- prise a power supply component 524 that can employ an internal power supply to power the barrier component 500 or can receive power from an external power supply that can be used to power the barrier component 500. In some implemen- tations, the power supply component 524 can receive power from the barrier control component, wherein the barrier con- trol component can produce power using one or more solar cells that can generate power based at least in part on the light\n\nIn an aspect, the projector screen component 600 can com- prise an interface component 602 that can present visual images and audio information to a user. The interface com- ponent 602 can provide one or more output interfaces (e.g.,\n\njector\n\nanother\n\nthe barrier\n\ncontent, as more fully\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nfrom and\n\ndesired.\n\nin\n\nUS 9,280,042 B2\n\n23\n\n24\n\nvarious implementations, a projector Screen 604, a display or\n\ncontent being presented.
