The feed solution flows inside the solution channel 50, and the vaporized refrigerant is driven to the feed solution for absorption by the partial vapor pressure difference. Apart from enhanced heat/mass transfer, this reactor geometry also makes the energy storage system more resistant to mechanical shock and less sensitive to orientation.\n\n[0036] The solution (refrigerant/absorbent mixture) of the energy storage system can be various, including H,O-based solutions, NH,-based solutions, alcohol-based solutions, hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-based solutions, hydrofluo- roolefin (HFO)-based solutions, CO,-based solutions, and other solutions. In these solutions, the absorbent can be salt, hydroxide, water, ionic liquid, or other inorganic/organic absorbents. In addition, the refrigerant can be pure refrig- erant or blend refrigerant, and the absorbent can be pure absorbent or blend absorbent.\n\nMar. 9, 2023\n\n[0037] Another embodiment of a membrane-based reactor is shown in FIG. 5. The FIG. 5 reactor 200 includes at least five channels, a solution channel 250, a refrigerant channel 240, two fluid channels 220 and 230, and a vapor channel 242. The additional vapor channel 242 can eliminate heat conduction between the solution channel 250 and the refrig- erant channel 240, avoiding heat interference with each other. Accordingly, two layers of membrane 245, 246 and two layers of hollow support plate 247, 248 are used.", "type": "Document"}}
