The cooperation between the virtual source, source, drain and the configurable gating droplet allows a reversible, efficient and sustainable conversion of the hydrodynamic energy, which is usually not utilized for power generation. The configurable and soft nature of the impinging water droplets ensures a high liquid/solid contact area, promoting the effective charge transfer, which is also in striking contrast to solid/solid contact electrification which suffers from limited point contact. In addition to advantages such as enhanced performances, optical transparency and cost-effectiveness, the transistor-like design can also be constructed on flexible substrates. This design principle represents potentially paradigm-shift solution to solving inherent power-density limitation imposed by the Interfacial effect, and could open new pathways for the efficient harvesting abundant hydrodynamic\n\nenergy in the form of tide, wave, or falling droplets.\n\nThe following provides more description of the experiments leading to the present invention.\n\nboth\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nFig.\n\nSuch\n\na\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/078143\n\nPCT/CN2020/122456\n\n15\n\nMethods\n\nMaterials.
