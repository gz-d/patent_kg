The novel fabrication methods can help control the\n\nods thereof . These novel hybrid materials are able to over- 30 material degradation process and provide bulk mechanical\n\ncome the problems of conventional biodegradable materials\n\nproperties similar to natural bone . In addition , these new\n\n( including magnesium - based materials ) , such as mis\n\nmaterials are highly compatible with cells , whereas related\n\nmatched bulk mechanical properties , poor biocompatibility ,\n\nart degradable metallic materials are not .\n\nrapid degradation , and hydrogen gas release upon degrada\n\nThe novel hybrid materials can be formed by biodegrad\n\ntion in orthopedic applications .
