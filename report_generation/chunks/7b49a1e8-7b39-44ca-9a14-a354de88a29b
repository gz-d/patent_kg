These K sub-channel signals may be combined together by removing the redundancy from the transmit signal sequence through down- and up-sampling, and the sampled sub-channel sequences are combined together to produce the decoded signal sequence y[n].\n\n[0033] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the wire- signal receiver comprises a plurality of receive antennas a plurality of digital equalizers.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0044] With reference to FIG. 2, the operation of communication system may be further explained using polyphase representation.
