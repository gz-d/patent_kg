In an exemplary embodiment, both support members 10a and 10b can be made of a superelastic material. The superelastic support members 10a and 10b can be bent to form a bent portion 14a and 14b to fit into the deformed spine portion 4, such as shown in Fig. 3. The correction of spine deformities can be achieved by straightening the bent portions 14a and 14b in a coronal or sagittal plane. In an exemplary embodiment, the hump of the bent portions 14a and 14b can be positioned at the posterior side of the body. The bent portions 14a and 14b can be joined to the deformed spine potion 4 in var- ious manners to apply the correction force thereto. In an embodiment, a plurality of anchor members 30 can be used to implant into one or more sections of the deformed spine portion 4 to join the same with the support members 10a and 10b. The anchor members 30 can be locked either at the time of operation or after the operation. [0049] Fig. 4 shows a fourth embodiment of the cor- rection device 1, which is of a dual support member type. The correction device 1 can comprise first and second support members 10a and 10b, such as \"C\" or \"S\" shaped supporting rods 12a and 12b. The support members 10a", "type": "Document"}}
