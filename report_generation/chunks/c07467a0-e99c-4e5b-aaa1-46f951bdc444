The pressure applied to the sample can be regulated by a pressure reducing regulator 114. It should be noted that the flow resistance in a micro- fluidic channel will increase significantly after a cell enters the microfluidic channel, thereby restricting other cells to enter the same microfluidic channel. As a result, other cells in the sample will move to other unoccupied microfluidic channels. Accordingly, nearly eighty individual cells can be examined in the microfluidic device 102 in each experiment.\n\n[0062] Also, it is noted that the pressure distributed on the microfluidic channels account for over 99% pressure differ- ence between the inlet 104 and outlet 106 of the microfluidic device 102 (see description below with respect to FIGS. 11A and 11B for further details). Thus, the driving pressures applied on the microfluidic device 102 can be used in calculations as the pressure differences between inlets and outlets of the microfluidic channels.\n\n[0063]\n\nFIG.\n\n1B illustrates\n\na diagram of a microscopic", "type": "Document"}}
