It can be observed from FIGS. 25-26 that the co-polarized fields 2506 (2606) are at least 15 dB stronger than the cross-polarized fields 2508 (2608) in the boresight direction (e.g., @=0\u00b0).\n\nThus, non-limiting closed subject matter, systems, devices, and methodologies that facilitate solar energy collection and use in communica- tions systems are provided. For instance, according to various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, one or more solar cell(s) can be combined with an antenna structure, com- ponents, or subcomponents used for radiating functions, which can also act as a light reflector for the one or more solar cell(s). According to an aspect, implementations of the dis- closed subject matter provide self-sustaining power to wire- less systems employing such implementations. As a further advantage, the dual function characteristic (e.g., radiating for wireless communication and solar energy focusing or collect- ing) can result in cost reductions in the design, fabrication, and/or operation of systems employing such implementa- tions. In addition, as described above, the various exemplary implementations can be applied to other areas of wireless communications, optical applications, without departing", "type": "Document"}}
