The present invention does not only apply in muscle regenera- tion, but also have potentials in neural regeneration, cardiac pacemaker and other biomedical applications. The localized electrical stimulation and delivery drug on target tissue exerted by the present device achieves better therapeutic effects than conventional drug delivery or electrostimulation systems/devices. The proven dissolution process of the present device demonstrates excellent drug release profile and efficacy in reducing inflammation response. In vivo studies further demonstrate a fast tissue regeneration within 9 days with the help of electrostimulation and drug delivery. Further, the fully biodegradable and bioresorbable device by the body of the recipient after a reasonable recovery period also proves that the present device is suitable for long-term regeneration therapy with minimal or substantially no post- surgical treatments required, lowering risks to the recipient arising from post-surgery stage or secondary surgical opera-\n\ntion for removing the implants as in conventional implant- able drug delivery devices/systems. What is claimed is:\n\n1. An implantable microneedle-based electrostimulation system for drug delivery to a recipient, comprising: a microneedle-based drug delivery module; and a Wirelessly-controlled electrostimulation module, the microneedle-based drug delivery module comprising a plurality of microneedles being electrically conduc- tive, each of the microneedles having a drug storage compartment for storing one or more substances to be\n\nUS 2024/0024646 Al", "type": "Document"}}
