Through detailed kinetic study, the first-order rate constant of the reaction was determined to be 0.013 min-1. The Km value of KTlip obtained from the fluorescent method matched well with that from the traditional HPLC method, underscoring that probe KTlip can serve as a useful tool for detecting enzymatic delipoylation activity. These data revealed that Sirt2 displays robust activity to remove the lipoyl group in vitro.\n\n[0084] Control experiments without the addition of NAD+ and enzyme unambiguously proved that the hydrolysis reac- tion is attributed to enzymatic activities rather than other environmental factors. In addition, the newly generated peak of KAlip-1 with Sirt2 showed the same retention time as the unmodified peptide (FIG. 3F). The delipoylation activity of HDAC8was further examined using KAlip-5 and KAlip-1. No delipoylated product was observed. The enzymatic delipoylation results by fluorescent probe KTlip and lipoy- lated peptides KAlip-5 and KAlip-1 together indicated that HDACS8 has no delipoylation activity.\n\nExample 6\u2014Delipoylation Study with Various Lipoylated Peptides\n\n[0085] A more detailed assessment of the enzymatic delipoylation reaction was performed. Time-dependent experiments and steady-state kinetics studies were con- ducted of KAlip-1, 5, 8, and 10 with Sirt2 (Table 1). Kinetics data (Table 1) revealed that the catalytic efliciency (K.,,/K,,,) for delipoylation activity of Sirt2 is of the same order of magnitude as that of the deacetylation of Sirt1-2, the desuc- cinylation/demalonylation of Sirt5, and the demyristoylation of", "type": "Document"}}
