The processor processes and analyses the EMG signal to generate a EMG pattern based on the EMG signal. The processor 108 may further include a controller. In an embodiment, the processor 108 may be a microcontroller. Preferably, the processor 108 includes a programmable logic unit selected from a field-program- mable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific inte- grated circuit (ASIC). The FPGA is capable of processing real-time data at a high computational speed, e.g. complet- ing one second real world activity within milliseconds. This is advantageous in that it can detect real-time abnormal motor movement particularly abnormal locomotion and respond to the abnormal motor movement in a short period of time or almost instantaneously.\n\n[0074] In an embodiment, the processor 108 outputs the stimulation signal to the neural electrode 104 continuously until the processor determines that the abnormal motor movement no longer exists. The neurostimulation system 100 is thus useful to minimize side effects caused by excessive continuous stimulations. In an alternative embodi- ment, when the processor 108 detects that the subject is having a certain motor movement which may be highly associated with ataxia, the processor 108 may automatically send the stimulation signal corresponding to said motor movement before determination of any abnormal behaviour so as to ensure the subject can move in a proper manner.", "type": "Document"}}
