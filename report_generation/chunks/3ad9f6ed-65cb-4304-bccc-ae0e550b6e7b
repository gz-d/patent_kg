A pair of platinum electrodes is inserted into the pores 604C and 604D to contact with the aforesaid sample and reference solutions. The pair of electrodes is further electrically con- nected to an external circuit with an ammeter so as to measure the change of current flow across the electrodes when the antigens are captured by the receptors on the membrane. The concentration of antigen in the sample solution is reflected by the magnitude of current measured.\n\n[0087] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.\n\n[0081] With reference to FIGS. 7A and 7B, there is shown two plots of a response of the electrochemical detector 100 in accordance with the embodiment as discussed in FIG. 6. As shown in FIG. 7A, the current across the electrodes decreases for each time the antigens are captured by the oligo-RNA receptors functionalized on the PC membrane. In particular, when the concentration of the antigen increases, the magnitude of current reduction increases accordingly, suggesting a substantially linear correlation between the antigen concentration and the current magnitude, which is in good agree with the electrophoretic transport theory.\n\n[0088] Any reference to prior art contained herein is not to be taken as an admission that the information is common general knowledge, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n1.
