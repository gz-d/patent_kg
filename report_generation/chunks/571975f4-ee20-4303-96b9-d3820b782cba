It is observed that mice in the control group showed steady pace with sharp peak of EMG and normal range of stance time. In contrast, the DKO mice showed unstable walking, early onset of muscle activities in stance phase, significantly increased stance and swing time, variation in EMG ampli- tude, and their abnormal activities from stance-to-stance phase and stance-to-swing phase. These results together suggest that the DKO mice have abnormal limb flexion.\n\n[0100] Mice were trained for 3 days (5 sessions per day) to walk on a walking track (100 cm length, 3 cm width and 10 cm height). Mice were anesthetized with isoflourance and IR-reflective microdots were attached at metatarsophalan- geal joint, ankle joint, knee joint, hip joint, and iliac crest with tissue glue. Recording head stage connector was plugged into socket of the electrodes. After recovery from anaesthesia, mice were allowed to acclimatize with reflector and head stage for 15 minutes and trained to walk sponta- neously at constant speed. A high-speed camera (500 frames per second) was used for video recording after adjusting the distance of camera to reflector, aperture and contrast to minimize the background. Stride length and stance time\n\n[0094] Further, the stance time was calculated and FIG. 3B shows the stance time of mice in control group and DKO group. DKO mice have a remarkably longer stance time as compared to the control group. Values represented mean+SEM (n-S-7). *P<0.05, Student\u2019s t-test.", "type": "Document"}}
