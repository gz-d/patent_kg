The one or more\n\ntive filter is a band - stop filter for absorbing or dissipating\n\nparasitic patches may be spaced apart from the patch . The\n\nstopband energy .\n\none or more parasitic patches may comprise two parasitic\n\npatches arranged at opposite sides of the patch . The two\n\n[ 0007 ]\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect , the\n\nparasitic patches may be slotted patches each having one or\n\nmicrostrip antenna includes a substrate , a ground plane\n\narranged a first face of the substrate , and a microstrip\n\nmore slots . In one example , the slot is rectangular . The two\n\nparasitic patches may be equally spaced apart from the patch\n\nnetwork arranged on a second , opposite face of the substrate .\n\nand symmetrically disposed about the patch .\n\nThe microstrip antenna may include further layers or com\n\nponents .
