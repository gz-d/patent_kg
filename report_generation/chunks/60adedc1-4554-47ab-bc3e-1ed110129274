The antenna can be excited to selectively operate as one type (frequency band) of antenna at a time or excited to simul- taneously operate as two or more types (different frequency bands) of antennas. The antenna may be operable in other frequency/wave bands, not necessarily millimeter and microwave bands. The dielectric resonator antenna need not be a microwave dielectric resonator antenna and the Fabry- Perot resonator antenna need not be a millimeter wave Fabry-Perot resonator antenna. The antenna and its compo- nents (the ground plane, the dielectric block, the excitation members, etc.) can have size, shape, geometry, or form different from those illustrated. For example, the ground plane need not be rectangular, and need not be arranged on the side of the dielectric block opposite the groove. The dielectric block need not be rectangular; the groove need not be extending between opposite ends of the dielectric block. The conductor can be conductor strips such as copper strips. Depending on construction and application, the antenna can be excited to different operation modes including those not specifically described. The antenna can support 4G, 5G, or\n\n[0061] FIGS. 13A and 13B show the measured and simu- ated radiation patterns of the wideband Fabry-Perot reso- nator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 at 24 GHz. It can be seen from FIGS. 13A and 13B that a reasonable agree- ment between the measured and simulated results is obtained. A distortion and asymmetry in the measured H-plane co-polar pattern is observed. This may be due to imperfections of the test setup. At both frequencies (or frequency bands), the co-polar fields are stronger than their cross-polar counterparts by more than 25 dB.", "type": "Document"}}
