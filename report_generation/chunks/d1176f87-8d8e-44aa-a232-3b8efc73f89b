As shown in FIG. 7, the antenna includes, generally: a dielectric block 302 with a groove 306 arranged on a ground plane 304, and a conductor 308 arranged in the groove 306.\n\n[0058] FIG. 10 shows the measured and simulated bore- sight antenna gains of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 and the simulated gains of the reference wideband dielectric resonator antenna. With reference to FIG. 10, the measured and simulated boresight antenna gains of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 are higher than 5 dBi from 2.32 to 2.95 GHz and from 2.26 to 3.07 GHz, respectively. As compared with the reference wideband dielectric resonator antenna, the wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7 has a more stable antenna gain across the frequency range of interest.\n\nTABLE II\n\nDimensions of the Wideband Dual-Frequency Antenna Parameter le Wo lp W ly d He Value 150 22 2 LS 5 71 4 (mm)\n\n[0059] FIG. 11 shows the measured antenna efliciency wideband dielectric resonator antenna of the antenna FIG. 7, varying from 74.6% to 95.4% in the 10\n\nof\n\nthe of\n\n300 dB\n\nMar. 4 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0066789 Al\n\n5\n\nimpedance frequency band , which shows the wideband\n\nbroadly described .
