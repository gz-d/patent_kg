Our result shows that the maximum transferred\n\nfunction of the Weber number or the maximum spreading\n\ncharges are comparable after water droplet impinging of\n\narea , the releasing heights of droplet were varied between 1\n\nsame times ( 1.6x104 ) with various thickness of PTFE film\n\nand 20 cm . In typical measurements , the elative humidity\n\nand the environment temperature were kept at approxi\n\nfrom 6.7 um to 16.9 um ( see FIG . 46 ) . It is noted that the\n\nmately 40 % and 20 \u00b0 C. , respectively .\n\nvoltage linearly increases with thickness of PTFE film ,\n\nwhich agree well with the tendency predicting by the circuit\n\nMolecular Dynamics Simulations .
