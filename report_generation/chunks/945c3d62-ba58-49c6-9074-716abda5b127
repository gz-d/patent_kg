The total number of concentrations to be tested is seven. Therefore, the range of concentrations to be tested covers 7 orders of mag- nitude. After incubation for a certain time period (e.g. 96 hours), embryos are fixed and blood vessels are visualized by color staining which specifically stains endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity predominantly in vascular endothelial cells. The number of intersegmental vessels is counted in each individual embryo. The number of embryos exhibiting a decrease or increase in the number of intersegmental vessels is counted at each concentration. An agent at any concentra- tion inducing alteration of the number of intersegmental ves- sels will be stated as a potential lead and passed to tier 2. Simultaneously, numbers of dead embryos are also counted at each concentration. This data will serve as preliminary range of concentrations to be tested in the following second tier.\n\nb. Administration of Agents\n\nAgents are dissolved in a desired concentration such that the highest testing concentration contains a concentration of arrier solvent (e.g. DMSO, ethanol) not more than the rec- mmended tolerant concentration. Agents are to be added directly to the medium solution at 4 hpf of the fish embryos. Assays should be performed in Petri dishes (60 mmx15 mm, Falcon, BD Bioscience, San Jose, Calif.). Each Petri dish is to hold 20 embryos.\n\nIn the second tier, occurrence of death and malformation is counted upon exposure of teleost to different concentrations of the potential lead agent identified in tier 1. The concentra- tion range to be tested is preliminarily determined in the range-finding experiment in the first tier.
