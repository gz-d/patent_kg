In particular, CECE expands the capability of material choices from limited base materials (e.g., Si and photoresist) to a broad range of engineering materials (e.g.\uff0c polymers, and other printable materials including SiO,, metal, ceramic). Polymers such as UV curable resins, ther- mosets, thermoset metals and thermoplastics. Therefore, CECE promises to pave the road for transferring biomimetic materials into real-world applications. A further break- through with CECE in several directions is expected. For example, the complexity of processible structures can be further extended (e.g., an array of micro helixes) by using more broadly tunable mold materials or realize greater diversity of functions (e.g., self-adaptive, layer-heterogenic,\n\n[0093] Mechanical robustness test. The robustness of the biomimetic materials was tested using a homemade buckling device. A strip (20 mmx5 mmx 0.1 mm) was fixed on the device and was buckled repeatedly at a frequency of 50 times per minute. The curvature of the tested strip was repeatedly changed between 10 cm\u2122! and 1 cm-1. The liquid contact angles and the rectification coefficient were mea- sured after every 1000 buckling cycles for monitoring the\n\n[0086] With the aid of CECE, the present invention enables constructing virtually 3D hierarchical structures\n\nhe potential to achieve a wide range of functionalities. tl\n\ntransport\n\n[0091]\n\nCECE-assisted molding\n\nThe configurabil-\n\nof beam structures with lengths.\n\nApr. 29 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0122091 A1\n\n8\n\nliquid repellency of the superomniphobic material and the\n\n[ 0101 ] Dynamic control of Young's modulus .
