[0011] The AC capacitor may be connected in series with the first coil forming a resonant tank with the first coil and the magnetic sheet. The diode rectifier may be either a standard diode rectifier or a voltage doubler. The output of the rectifier can preferably be fed to a DC-DC voltage regulator which provides a stable voltage for charging the battery. In some embodiments of the invention the diode [0012] rectifier and the capacitor are formed as part of the battery\n\n30\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0017] Some embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55", "type": "Document"}}
