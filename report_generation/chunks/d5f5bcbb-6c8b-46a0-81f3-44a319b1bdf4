In one embodiment, the hearing profile may also include vol- ume or volume ratio of vocal group or instrumental group in the music recording. To be specific, the audio signal AS1 may further includes a vocal group and an instrumental group, and the processing step of the method also adjusts the weights of enhancement of the vocal group and the instru- mental group. A user may save a preferred volume or volume ratio of vocal group or instrumental group, and with the enhancement of FO component, the user may enjoy the music through audio signal AS2 (Step $23).\n\nThe audio processing system 10 and the method for processing audio signals have a user-specific calibration process that allows users to tailor-adjust musical features to achieve a more pleasurable music listening experience. Also, in some cases, that the calibration does not require repro- gramming of the cochlear implant hardware, which is pri- marily pre-configured for human speech and not readily accessible by the end user.\n\nThe method for processing audio signal AS1 includes: extracting a fundamental frequency (FO) from an audio signal AS1 (Step S1); processing the audio signal AS1 with DoME based on a hearing profile and output an audio signal AS2 (Step S2); and providing the audio signal AS2 to a user 50 (Step S3). During the processing step $2, the DoME enhances the FO component, and the enhancement weight of the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile.", "type": "Document"}}
