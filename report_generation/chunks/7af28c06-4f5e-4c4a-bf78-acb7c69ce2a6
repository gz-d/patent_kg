The resistance of the whole device will gradually increase with the degradation process, and the resonant impedance also degrades (FIG. 2H). However, the device can output the voltage of 1V after a three-day degradation, which is enough for typical muscle regeneration therapies (FIG. 21). For a long-term therapeutic regime, appropriate encapsulation of the present device such as coating corresponding materials on its surface to delay the degradation process is suggested.\n\n[0157] Turning to FIG. 3A, in order to demonstrate the cytocompatibility of the materials suggested to be coated on the present device, NIH 3T3 cells are used and stained by the Live/Dead kit after culturing for 24 h in a soaking medium with different microneedle patches (PLGA without coating, PLAG coated with Au, PLAG coated with Mg/W). The green fluorescence in FIG. 3A indicates live cells, while red fluorescence suggests dead cells. Most cells are alive in all these groups, demonstrating that these microneedle patches have a good cytocompatibility even in the presence of the suggested metal coating. Their quantified cell viability is further confirmed by the alamarBlue test (FIG. 3B). There is no significant difference of cell viability among different groups, indicating PLGA microneedles and the suggested coating layers have no obvious side effect on cytocompat- ibility.\n\n[0158] Since some literatures suggested that electrical stimulation could improve myoblasts\u2019 behavior including cell migration which is an important stage of wound healing, to further verify that the present device can improve muscle tissue regeneration, a scratch assay is performed to evaluate\n\nJan, 25, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
