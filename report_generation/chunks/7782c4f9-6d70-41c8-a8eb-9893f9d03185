In this way, the first-stage power converter also con- trols the power of the active group.\n\n2. The planar battery charging system as c wherein the first-stage power converter aimed in claim is current\n\n3. The planar battery charging system asc erein the first-stage power converter aimed in claim is voltage-con-\n\nA resonant tank may be used in the primary circuit in order to ensure that the current in the winding is sinusoidal. Sinu- soidal current in the primary winding, which creates the AC magnetic flux, ensures that the harmonic losses and EMI radiation are minimized. The use of a second-stage power inverter that is switched at a constant frequency equal to the resonant frequency of the primary circuit further assists in ensuring that the current in the primary winding is sinusoidal.\n\n4, The planar battery charging system as claimed in claim wherein the current fed to said primary winding is moni- to provide a feedback control of said variable DC-link voltage.\n\n[he planar battery charging system as claimed in claim wherein a step-down transformer is provided between of said second-stage power inverter and the primary winding.", "type": "Document"}}
