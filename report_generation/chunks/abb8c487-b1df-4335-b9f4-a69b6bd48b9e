After click chemistry reac- tion with rhodamine-azide, chilled acetone was added to the reaction mixtures. The reaction was then placed in a -20\u00b0 C. freezer for 1 h to precipitate the proteins. The pellets were washed with cold methanol and air-dried. Finally, they were redissolved in 1x SDS loading buffer by heating at 95\u00b0 C. for 0 min and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. The labelled proteins were visualized using a FLA-9000 Fujifilm scanner (Ex=532 nm).\n\n[0105] PDH Activity Assay.\n\nTo overexpress Sirt2 in cells, pCMV 4aSirt2Flag vector was transfected into HeLa-S3 cells using Lipofectarnine 2000 Cnvitrogen) . The activity of PDH was assessed by measur- ing absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate assay kit (pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity microplate assay, Abcam, ab109902) . A 1000 hg amount of cell protein extracts was used for PDH immunocapture in each well. The experiments were performed in duplicate.\n\n[0100] Western Blotting.\n\nTo perform Western blotting experiments, samples were first separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immo- bilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The samples were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (0.1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Subsequently the membrane was incubated with primary antibody (anti-sirt2/antilipoic acid/anti-DLAT) at 4\u00b0 C. over-\n\n[0106] Mitochondria Isolation.\n\nThe mitochondrial fraction was isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using a mitochondria isolation kit (Thermo Fisher, cat.
