To deposit the nano-\n\n[0049] The inventors of the present application have devised, through experiments and trials, that existing method for nanostructuring the Ag metals are tedious and ineffective. Such techniques are generally either time-con- suming or expensive, let alone the poor morphological\n\na\n\nporous\n\nin\n\nin\n\ngenerated\n\nture\n\na\n\nfirst\n\nture\n\na\n\nin\n\nis\n\na\n\nlic\n\nMay 6 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0130973 A1\n\n3\n\nIllustratively , the voltage / current waveform consists of peri\n\nstructured metallic layer 20 onto the metallic structure 10 ,\n\nthe metallic structure 10 is subjected to electrochemical\n\nodically modulated potential / current between two extreme\n\ntreatment under a periodically modulated potential .
