The size of the pores is typically in the nanometre range, possibly 150 nanometres or less, and. preferably 50 nanometres or less. When the drug precipitates inside the pores, the size and width of the pores provide a spatial restriction which prevents formation of particles of the drug bigger than, typically, the width of the pores.\n\n[0012] The method typically ends with removing the from the ice.\n\ncipitate\n\npre-\n\n[0013] Preferably, the method comprises the further step forming the ice in at least one well of a microplate, diameter of the well being about 16 mm, or less. This provides that ice formed in the well has a surface that has same diameter of 16 mm, or less.\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\n[0014] The method is particularly advantageous for pro- ducing nanoparticles of curcumin, in which case the solution is of curcumin dissolved in tetrahydrofuran at concentration of 1 mg/ml to 50 mg/ml. However, it is more preferable that the solution is of curcumin dissolved in tetrahydrofuran at concentration of 10 mg/ml, which possibly gives a particle size most suitable for medical use.\n\n[0015] Ina second aspect, the invention proposes a piece of ice; the piece of ice having wall defining surface for receiving a drug solution; the surface has an area that is substantially equivalent to an area defined by a diameter of 16 mm; the ice embedded with nanoparticles of a hydro- phobic pharmaceutical compound; the nanoparticles formed. in-situ inside pores in the ice.\n\n[0016] Typically, the piece of ice is formed in a well 24-well microplate; the well providing the confined surface.\n\nina\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES", "type": "Document"}}
