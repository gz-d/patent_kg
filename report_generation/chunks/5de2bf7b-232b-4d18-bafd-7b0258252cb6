For example, p,=2, p.\u20143, and p,\u20145 may be chosen to represent Cyan, Mageton, and Yellow respectively. Since 2, 3, and 5 are three smallest prime values, where each of them is independent with other two primes. Then 2x3=6 may represent Blue, 3x5=15 may represent Red, and 2x5=10 may represent Green. Alterna- tively, other combinations of prime numbers may also be used, and the prime numbers may represent other basic colors in other color representations.\n\n[0102] For example, a color may be represented as an integer 2% 3\u00b0 5\u00b0 for a, B, o be integers within 0 and 255. Based on this representation, more than 16 million colors may be mapped by the color mapper. The mixture of multiple colors can also be manipulated conveniently. Alter- natively, different number of i andj may be used in different embodiments such that the color mapper may map a differ- ent number of colors in a color space. For example, when j is in the range of 0-63, the color mapper may map around 26 thousands colors based on 3 basic colors pi-\n\n[0118] These three integers 6, 10, 15 are the multiplication of two primes in (2, 5 5), which implies these three colors are equally composed of two colors in (Cyan, Mageton, Yellow). Then using 2x3x5=30 to represent Gray, which implies Gray is equally composed of three colors Cyan, Mageton, and Yellow.", "type": "Document"}}
