For example, patients suffering from serious flavivirus or entero- virus infection may only receive supportive care including administration with intravenous fluids, hospitalization, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections.\n\nwherein the flavivirus is Japanese encephalitis virus, or Dengue virus.\n\n[0004] There is currently a lack of effective remedy in treating RNA virus infection particularly caused by flavivi- ruses and enteroviruses.\n\n[0008] Ina third aspect, the present invention relates to a method of inhibiting the entry of an enterovirus and/or a lentivirus into host cells, comprising contacting the host cells with an effective amount of berbamine or its analogue as described above.\n\n[0005] Accordingly, there remains a strong need for novel compounds which are useful in the prevention or treatment of RNA viral infection particularly flavivirus infection.\n\n[0009] Ina fourth aspect, the present invention relates use of berbamine or its analogue in prevention or treatment a RNA virus infection, particularly but not exclusively flavivirus infection, an enterovirus infection or a lentivirus infection.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0006] method of preventing or treating a subject suffering from a flavivirus infection by administering an effective amount of berbamine or its analogue to the subject, berbamine has a structure of Formula (1): In a first aspect, the present invention pertains to a\n\n[0010] Still further, berbamine or its analogue may be used the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating RNA virus infection, particularly but not exclusively a flavivirus infection, an enterovirus infection or a lentivirus infection.\n\n[0002]\n\nRNA viruses, particularly positive single-stranded\n\nareas.", "type": "Document"}}
