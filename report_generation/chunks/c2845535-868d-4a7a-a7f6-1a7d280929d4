Statistical Significance Test for SR-3DVQA\n\n[0146] Moreover, to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, statistical significance test was per- formed. F-test based on the result of the variance ratio of the predicted residuals between two methods was used to indi- cate the significance. The predicted residual is obtained from DMOS, predicted by test model and the ground truth DMOS, which can be described as\n\nres(k)=DMOS,(4)-DMOS(k) (22)\n\nwhere res(k) represents the predicted residual of the test model on video k. The variance of the residuals, termed as Var,, of the test model i on all the videos could be calculated. Then, the variance ratio Riy between test models i and j could be computed, which could be written as\n\n_ Var; (23) \u201ciS Var;\n\n[0147] IfR,,, is greater than the F-ratio threshold which is determined by the sample size and the significance level, it means the performance of test model j is significantly superior to that of test model i; otherwise, the difference is insignificant. Based on the variance ratios between the above listed benchmark schemes and the SR-3DVQA\n\nsamples in UzrUp are included into C;C,.
