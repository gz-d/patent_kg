It is most likely that some toxic compo- nents released from the substrate cause the cell death rather than the apoptosis.* Shih et al. reported that the supernatant and corrosive products from NiTi may result in the death of smooth muscle cells, especially when the amount of released nickel is higher than 9 ppm.* A few other studies have also reported that nickel ionss leached from the alloys cause allergic reactions in nickel hyper-sensitive patients.\u201d1\u00b0 While the homogeneity of the materials microstructures and the surface morphology may alter the anti-corrosion ability of NiTi alloys, there is no doubt that the corrosion resistance and anti-wear properties of the materials must be enhanced before the materials can be widely used clinically, especially as orthopedic implants with couplings where fretting is expected.", "type": "Document"}}
