To achieve this quasi-equilib- rium the interior of the evaporation chamber 17 is relatively large witha large internal area. The feed conduit 4 is relatively Jong and with a small internal diameter (eg 6 mm). The ratio of the length of the feed conduit 4 to the internal diameter should be more than 4.\n\nIt will thus be seen that by appropriate design of the key parameters suchas the length and diameter of the feed conduit 4, the evaporation rate in the evaporation chamber 17, and the pumping rate of the pump 9, asteady-state glow discharge can be established and continuous implantation of atoms into the sample can take place.
