The PLGA solution was spin coated on glass wafer (1000 rpm/s, 30 s) followed by annealing step at 160\u00b0 C. for more than 20 min to yield a PLGA substrate (~20 jum). A piece of laser-cut Mg foil (40 jun thick) pattern was attached on the PLGA substrate before cooling to room temperature. Silicon nanofilm diode was chosen for their biodegradability which has been published before. Covering the coils with PLGA and tacking the system yielded a compact, double-coil structure with open- ings for interconnections. After that, two layer of patterned Mg foil on the PLGA substrate were attached face to face where conductive contact pointed are electrically intercon- nected with biodegradable conductive W pasts.\n\nExample 2\u2014Preparation of Bioresorbable Microneedle Patches\n\n[0166] Commercial aspirin (99%, Rhawn) or ibuprofen (98%, Macklin) were dissolved in chloroform and mixed with PLGA solution, where the mass of aspirin and ibupro- fen are the weight ratio of 10% and 5% of PLGA polymers, respectively. Then the composite solution was added in a PDMS microneedle mold. The solutions in the mold were put in a vacuum over at 40\u00b0 C. until no solvent remained. Finally, the solidified PLGA microneedles with mold were put at 100\u00b0 C. heating stage for 2 h to remove residual solvent. After that, the obtained PLGA microneedles were heat pressed on the wireless electric stimulative electrodes, followed by depositing W (~1000 nm) on the PLGA microneedle to yield the conductive microneedle electrodes.\n\nExample 3\u2014Finite Element Analysis", "type": "Document"}}
