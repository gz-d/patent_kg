The soft magnetic sheet may be, for example, square, rectangular or other polygonal shapes as shown in FIG. 11(a), or may be circular or oval as shown in FIG. 11(6). The winding and soft magnetic sheet form an energy pick-up coil or inductor as shown in FIG. 11(a) or 11(6), which then forms a resonant tank with the small resonant capacitor. When sensing a high-frequency AC magnetic flux flowing perpendicularly (or vertically) from the surface of the planar inductive battery charging platform, the energy pick-up coil will develop an AC voltage by Faraday\u2019s law and picks up the energy transmitted from a planar charg- ing platform. This coil enclosing the soft magnetic sheet (as a low-profile magnetic core) is essentially a planar inductor. This planar inductor and the series-connected AC capacitor form a series resonant tank that can amplify the AC voltage for the diode rectifier. The diode rectifier and the DC capacitor rectify the AC voltage into a DC voltage that can be fed to a battery charging circuit. Preferably a voltage regulator can be used to provide a stable DC voltage from the output of the rectifier.
