For example, the correction device can further comprise one or more of the following components: (a) means for alternating the diameter of the support member to control recovery force; (b) one or more internal motor, gear boxes, and the like; and (c) springs or coils or wires made from a superelastic material or other materials with similar properties.\n\nThe support member 10 can be formed of various materi- als. For example, the support member 10 can be formed of a material that is capable of providing sufficient strength for the correction device 1. In one exemplary embodiment, the sup- port member can comprise an elastic material capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force. For example, the support member 10 can be formed of superelastic or pseudoelastic material, or other materials with similar properties.\n\nAccording to another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for correcting spinal deformities. In one embodiment, a correction force having a predetermined amount can be provided to a deformed spine portion. If desired, the magnitude to the correction force can be adjusted. The correction force can be maintained at a constant or sub- stantially constant level until the spinal deformities are fully corrected. The correction force can be activated either during or after the spine surgery. In an exemplary embodiment, the correction force can be generated by a correction member formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material or the like. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of generating the correction force are also within the scope of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
