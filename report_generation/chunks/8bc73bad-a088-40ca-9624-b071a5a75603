In step 140 inverse quantization is carried out to de- quantize the coefficients of the quantized transformed residual block Z. The inverse quantizing produces an inverse quantized transform of the residual block F. The block F is then inverse scale transformed in step 150 and inverse ICT transformed in step 160. Steps 150 and 160 have the com- bined effect of performing a transform similar to an inverse DCT and the result is the reconstructed residual block D in the spatial domain.\n\n-continued\n\n180 72 54 18 \u5168 72 36 18 18 Fe 36 18 18 18 18 18 18 0", "type": "Document"}}
