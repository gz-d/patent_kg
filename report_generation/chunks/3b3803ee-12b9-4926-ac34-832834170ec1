The typical R-3m model is adopted for both of the materials, since the locally distorted monoclinic phase, as well as its interfacial feature, results in very similar XRD patterns with the hexagonal structure. For the pristine material, only a slight contraction is observed for both a- and c-axis at the initial state of charge (SOC) stage, indicating that the R-3m framework of H1 could tolerate a small content of delithi- ation. As the SOC reaches to 10% (~3.7 V), the H1-H2 phase transition occurs, and the newly emerged H2 phase exhibits a structural break in contrast to the H1 structure. Such lattice mismatch between H1 and H2 becomes increasingly severe until the H1 is completely disappeared. Therefore, the coex-\n\nUS 2022/0115659 Al\n\nistence of H1 and H2 in the lattice of the pristine NCM811 may induce mechanical fractures that deteriorate the revers- ible capacity and cyclic stability. As for PGE-NCM81], all in-situ XRD patterns can be described well with single model, confirming that the striking H1-H2 transition in the pristine material has been replaced by moderate solid- solution reaction in the inventive PGE material.\n\nfurther delithiation, the lattice of both mate-", "type": "Document"}}
