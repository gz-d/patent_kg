Generally, as program modules include routines, programs, objects, components and data files assisting in the performance of particular functions, the skilled person will understand that the functionality of the software application may be distributed across a number of routines, objects or components to achieve the same func- tionality desired herein.\n\n[0096] It will also be appreciated that where the methods and systems of the invention are either wholly implemented. by computing system or partly implemented by computing systems then any appropriate computing system architecture may be utilized. This will include stand-alone computers, network computers, dedicated or non-dedicated hardware devices. Where the terms \u201ccomputing system\u201d and \u201ccom- puting device\u201d are used, these terms are intended to include any appropriate arrangement of computer or information processing hardware capable of implementing the function described.\n\n[0097] The above embodiments of the invention can simultaneously image hemoglobin concentration, blood flow speed, and oxygen saturation within sub-microseconds, using limited number of lase pulses. A dual-pulse approach can be used to measure the blood flow with only two short-delayed A-lines. A dual-pulse (or multiple-pulse) flowmetry can be performed based on a series of A-lines. The principle originates from the first laser pulse\u2019s heating\n\na\n\nJan. 13, 2022\n\neffect on the second, subsequent pulse, which can be affected", "type": "Document"}}
