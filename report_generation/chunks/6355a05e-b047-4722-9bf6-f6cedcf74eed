The second phase includes curing the elastomer mold at a temperature higher than the curing temperature during the first phase to enhance the stiffness, self-sealing and config- urability of the elastomer mold; filling the cavity mold with areplica material and curing the replica material to fabricate a replica of the master structure; and removing the replica from the elastomer mold.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0001] The present invention relates to a fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures. More par- ticularly, it relates to a method of fabricating three-dimen- sional (3D) hierarchical structures by harnessing the con- figurable elastic crack engineering.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
