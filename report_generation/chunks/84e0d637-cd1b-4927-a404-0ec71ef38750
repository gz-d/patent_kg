Unlike GB2399225A, the\n\nUS 8,040,103 B2\n\n1\n\n2\n\ncharging platform described in GB2389720A uses a multi- layer planar winding array to generate an AC flux 4 that has almost uniform magnitude over the entire charging surface 5. The lines of flux of this charging platform flow \u201cperpendicu- larly\u201d in and out of the charging surface as shown in FIG. 2. This perpendicular flow of flux is very beneficial because it allows energy transfer over the surface on which the elec- tronic equipment (to be charged) is placed.\n\nBATTERY CHARGING APPARATUS WITH PLANAR INDUCTIVE CHARGING PLATFORM\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThis application is a continuation of PCT Application PCT/ CN2006/002100, filed Aug. 18, 2006, and published under the PCT Articles in English as WO 2007/019806 Al on Feb. 22, 2007.

If the charging platform is placed on a metallic desk, the AC flux generated in the charging platform may induce currents in the metallic desk, resulting in incorrect energy transfer and even heating effects in the metallic desk. U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,364 has been shown to be an effective electro- magnetic shield for this type of planar charging platform. The electromagnetic shield in U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,364 simply consists of a thin layer of soft magnetic material (such as ferrite) and a thin layer of conductive material (such as cop-\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
