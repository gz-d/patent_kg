Based on the obtained optimum Z,,_3f, in the above disclosure, the impedance of the antenna should be tuned to about 6.4+j23Q after de-embedding the Zs_3f, shown in FIG. 13.\n\n[0192] In one embodiment, a capacitive coupling antenna feeding method as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B are used. The desired input impedance can be easily obtained by tuning and ds of the transmission line portion shown in FIG. 4B.\n\n[0193] FIG. 14A shows the final designed input imped- ance, i.e., simulated input impedance of a patch antenna in the unit cell 400 of FIG. 4A at 3f,. FIG. 14B shows simulated gain of a patch antenna in the unit cell 400 of FIG. 4A at f, and 3f,. As shown in FIG. 14A, the small coupling capacitance can be used to suppress fundamental radiation, evidenced by the difference in the simulated gain of the array. In one example design, a significant gain difference of about 36 dB can be realized.\n\n1\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n[0194] A 12x12 coupled oscillator array and a 1x2 unit cell are designed based on the above embodiments (in particular FIGS. 2-4B) and fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS process.\n\n[0195] FIG. 15 shows a die micrograph of an integrated circuit (chip) of a 12x12 coupled oscillator array fabricated in accordance with the 12x12 coupled oscillator array of FIG. 3A. FIG. 16 shows a die micrograph of an integrated. circuit (chip) ofa 1x2 unit cell (of a coupled oscillator array) fabricated in accordance with the 1x2 unit cell of FIG. 4A. In this example, the whole chip size of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array is 2 mmx1.7 mm, and the core area is 1.8 mmx1.5 mm.", "type": "Document"}}
