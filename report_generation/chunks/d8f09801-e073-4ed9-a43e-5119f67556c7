FIG. 12B shows magnetic flux density vs distance relationship for the elec- tromagnetic actuation system of FIG. 12A where the size of workspace is 160 mm. FIG. 12C shows magnetic flux density vs distance relationship where the size of workspace is 100 mm. The vertical axis represents magnetic flux density, while the horizontal axis represents distance.\n\n[0102] As illustrated, coil 1 and 5 are energized current of 20 A in clockwise direction. Coil 2 and 6 energized with current of 20 A in counterclockwise direc- tion. Coil 4 and 8 are energized with current of 10 A\n\nwith\n\nare\n\nin\n\nUS 2024/0145145 Al\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nclockwise direction. Coil 3 and 7 are energized with current of 10 A in counterclockwise direction. Representative mag- netic field lines 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, and 1208 are shown in FIG. 12A, where arrows indicate directions of the magnetic field lines.\n\n[0103]\n\nAs\n\nillustrated\n\nin\n\nFIGS.\n\n12B\n\nand 12C,\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
