The structure and dimension of the robotic DT4E core are designed based on parametric optimization using the finite element method. This new core shape and structure design can considerably enhance the magnetic field generated by the electromagnetic actuation system to drive microrobots in in-vivo environ- ments with several (such as eight) electromagnetic heads with a large and changeable workspace.\n\n[0041] One or more embodiments provide devices, or methods for the gradient enhancement of electro- magnetic actuation in a varying workspace due to the robotic\n\ntems,\n\nsys-\n\nUS 2024/0145145 Al\n\ncore design for electromagnetic coils. The shape and size of the robotic core and iron bridge are designed based on parametric optimization using the finite element method for maximizing magnetic field strength and gradient generation by the electromagnetic coil. This addresses the critical need to deliver microrobots in certain applications, such as clini- cal applications.\n\n[0042] One or more embodiments provides an electromag- netic actuation system actuating actuation subject (such as microrobots) carrying cells moving to a target site inside a body under control of an external gradient magnetic field. Compared with many existing systems, the provided system has a better driving capability with a larger workspace. High magnetic gradient with efficient energy consumption can further be realized.\n\n[0043]\n\nOne\n\nembodiments\n\nrelate\n\nto biological", "type": "Document"}}
