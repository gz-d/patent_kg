The method of claim 17, wherein the processor compares the gait cycle with pre-set gait cycle data determine whether the EMG pattern is indicative of abnormal motor movement.\n\nprocessing EMG signal a processor to generate EMG pattern based on the EMG signal, and outputting a stimulation signal to the neural electrode when the EMG pattern is indicative of the abnormal motor movement.\n\n19. The method of claim 11, wherein the data acquisition communicates with the processor via a wireless work.\n\n12. The method of claim 11, wherein more than one EMG electrode is implanted in tibialis anterior and/or gastrocne- mius muscle.\n\n20. The method of claim 11, wherein the processor outputs the stimulation signal to the neural electrode via stimulus generator.\n\n13. The method of claim 11, wherein the subject suffers ataxia.\n\n21. The method of claim 11, wherein the processor outputs the stimulation signal to the neural electrode con- tinuously until the processor determines that the abnormal motor movement no longer exists.\n\n14.
