FIG. 12 shows the measured and simulated reflection coefficients of the wide- band Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7. With reference to FIG. 12, the measured and simulated impedance bandwidths of the current Fabry-Perot resonator antenna are 16.18% (23.23-27.32 GHz) and 18.99% (23.21-28.08 GHz), respectively. The measured result has a narrower bandwidth. The discrepancy between the two results may be due to fabrication errors of the L-probe.", "type": "Document"}}
