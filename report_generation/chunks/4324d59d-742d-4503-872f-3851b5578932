To be specific, the processing may include adjusting or enhancement of the FO component, the vocal group, or the instrumental group.\n\n5\n\nThe input device 130 is electrically connected to the processor 120, and the input device 130 is configured to generate a controlling signal to the processor 120, and the processor 120 adjusts the enhancement weight of the FO component based on the controlling signal from the input device 130 and the hearing profile saved in the audio processing system 10.\n\nThis can be accomplished by offline software processing hosted on consumer devices, a hardware device arranged between the audio source and the playback device, or real-time via acoustic sensors such as microphones. The audio signals in these cases are processed based on user calibration settings to either enhance/reduce existing fea- tures of the audio or to synthesize new features based on characteristics of the source audio.\n\nThe audio processing system 10 and the method", "type": "Document"}}
