FIGS. 1G and 1H show the result of a bendability test on different parts of the present device, suggesting certain flexibility or bendability of the present device in vivo. Mechanical simulation in FIG. 1M further demon- strates the flexibility/bendability of different parts of the present device, in particular, between the metal foil and the metal coil (c & d) and the connections (a & b) between the metal coil and the two electrodes exposed out of the microneedle patch. The microneedle patch is also bendable, enhancing attachment thereof on tissues with different cur- vature (FIG. 11). The effect of the composition of the microneedle patch on the flexibility/bendability is also stud- ied by performing certain mechanical tests on microneedle patches made by different molecular weights of PLGA: PLGA I (lactide:glycolide=65:35, Mw=10,000); PLGA II (lactide: glycolide=65:35, Mw=60,000); and PLGA III (lac- tide:glycolide=65:35, Mw=330,000). PLGA I microneedles become fracted under low force at around 0.12 N on each needle, while microneedles made by PLGA II and PLGA III are only deformed but without obvious fraction in the mechanical tests (FIG. 1J), suggesting the capability of PLGA II and PLGA III microneedles to insert into the tissue. The modulus of PLGA III microneedles is around 92 MPa, which is than that of PLGA II microneedles\n\nhigher 77 MP) (FIG. 1K). It is\n\n(around.\n\nthat the duration of", "type": "Document"}}
