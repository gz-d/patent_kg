The further power supply may voltage supply.\n\nprovided an electron gun comprising: an electron emission element, an electrode, a control element, and a control circuit. The electron emission element is arranged to be activated to emit electron beam. The electrode is arranged to be electrically connected with a power supply to accelerate the emitted electron beam. The control element may be arranged between the electron emission element and the electrode. The control element is arranged to be electrically connected with the power supply to provide an electric field to control emission of electron beams from the electron emission element. The control circuit is electrically con- nected with the control element for changing the electric field provided by the control element. In operation the electron emission element acts as a cathode and the elec- trode act as an anode. The power supply may be a voltage supply. The electrode and the control element may each be connected, directly or indirectly, with a respective terminal of the power supply. By using the same power supply for the electrode and the control element (instead of using respec- tive power supplies for the electrode and the control ele- ment), along with the control circuit that controls the control element, the electron gun can be made simpler yet can be effectively controlled to control electron beam emission to\n\nIn one embodiment of the first aspect, the electron emis- sion element is a thermoionic electron emission element arranged to be heated to emit electrons. The thermoionic electron emission may be a metallic hairpin such as a tungsten hairpin, a Lanthanum Hexaboride (LaB,) hairpin, or a Cerium Hexaboride (CeB,) filament.", "type": "Document"}}
