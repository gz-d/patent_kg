A PDMS stamp was then cast to obtain a complementary structure, which consisted of 8-Hm diameter microwells with 5-,un diameter microposts standing in the centers of them. A plastic bar was then applied to squeeze the PDMS piece from one direction at once. The microposts were bent to the same direction and stick to the side wall of the microwells. After the PDMS piece was baked at 250\u00b0 C. for 1 h, the microstructures on the PDMS were stabilized. This master could then be repeatedly used for molding thermoplastic replicas. The molded structure thereby con- tains split-rings. By adjusting the exposure dosage for the SU-8, split rings with different intervals or horizontally hanging closed loops can be fabricated. Enlarging the expo- sure dose increases the top thickness of the ring on the SU-8 master, thereby creating bigger room at the bottom of the\n\n[0103] RTV615 is designed for using with an optimum ratio of pre-polymer to cure agent Ry ,,e/cure equals to 10. Changing the mixing ratios of the PDMS will alter the polymerization kinetics. Decreasing R,,,,\u00a2/cure (\u20ac-2-- from 10 to 5) promotes the crosslinking rate of PDMS, resulting in enhanced stiffness of the PDMS in Phase I, while the final stiffness in Phase II does not change much since the final polymer networks produced using these ratios are similar. However, a much higher concentration (Rj gse/cure<5) Of the curing agent causes a decrease of Young\u2019s modulus both in Phase I and II, because the excess curing agent dilutes the network. On the other hand, when the Ryjse/eure is above 10, the curing rate is reduced, and the average chain length becomes low, resulting in decreased Young\u2019s modulus of the PDMS in both Phases I and II.", "type": "Document"}}
