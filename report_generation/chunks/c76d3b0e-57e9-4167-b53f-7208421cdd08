It was found that, under the same frequency (Le., 40 kHz), the longer the ultrasonic duration, the smaller the solder particle size, even as small as less than 6 hm in diameter, as depicted in FIGS. 1B and 2B. Moreover, it was also found that, by increasing the frequency and duration of ultrasonication, particles with an average size of about 300-400 nm were produced (FIGS. 1C and 2C). The results collectively indicated that the sizes of solder particles could be adjusted according to one\u2019s need by varying the frequency and duration of ultrasonication. Fur- ther, the SEM photographs of FIGS. 1A to 1C also con- firmed that the present Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles independently possessed a good uniformity and smooth\n\nsurface.\n\n[0078] The XRD and EDS analysis (data not shown) also confirmed that of the Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles in Groups I| to II] were predominantly composed of free Sn, Biln, Biln,, and BiaIns crystal phases, and all the elements of Sn, Bi, and In were evenly distributed in each particles, even in the solder particles that were less than 1 hm in diameter.\n\nwith\n\nJan. 11, 2024\n\n[0079] Further, DSC analysis confirmed that the peak temperature of the solder particles ranged from 61.36\u00b0 C. to 61.64\u00b0 C., which was lower than that of the bulk solder alloy (ie., 62\u00b0 C.). This finding further suggested that the spheri- cal particles could decrease the melting point of the same alloy.\n\n[0080] 2.
