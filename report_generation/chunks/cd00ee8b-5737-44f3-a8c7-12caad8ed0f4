Importantly, any improper or delay treatment of a disease could lead to a fatal conse- quence to a patient, regardless of what type of the disease is. Thus, the screening and diagnosis of the disease is of paramount importance.\n\n[0015] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the target substance is a cancer biomarker.\n\n[0016] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the cancer biomarker is an antigen of gastric cancer.\n\n[0017] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the porous layer is a gold deposited track-etched polycarbonate mem- brane or a gold deposited porous aluminum membrane.\n\n[0003] Traditional screening methods usually include invasive procedures during sampling process. The screening methods are also time-consuming and require tedious instru- ments installed in laboratories for carrying out the measure- ments. Although the results generated therefrom may be very accurate and sensitive, such methods may not be suitable for daily applications which require point-of-care and low-cost setup.\n\n[0018] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the solution chamber is an enclosed chamber.", "type": "Document"}}
