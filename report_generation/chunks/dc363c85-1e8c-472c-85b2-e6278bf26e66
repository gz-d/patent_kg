The theoretical time delay in a 50 m fiber is ~243 ns but due to the time delay in free space the actual time delay in this example is increased. By adjusting the incident pulse energy and polarization state, the 50 m fiber 310 can maximize the pulse energy of the 545 nm and avoids generating other stokes wavelengths. In this embodiment, the energy and polarization are adjusted to generate only the first wave- length (545 nm) but not other higher order Stokes wave- lengths. The beam combination is for 532 nm and 545 nm. A long-pass filter LPF (T540lpxr, CHROMA) is placed after the 50 m Raman fiber to pass the 545 nm and reflect the 532 nm. Respective fiber couplers FC3 and FC4 are placed upstream and downstream of the single-mode fiber 310. For system calibration, another 30 m polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber (not shown) is used to generate and delay the 545 nm by 163 ns.\n\n[0081] In the 558 nm Raman path, the pump beam is coupled into a loom graded-index multi-mode fiber 320 (GIMMSC(50/125)HT, FIBERCORE) to generate 558 nm laser pulse with a 512 ns time delay.
