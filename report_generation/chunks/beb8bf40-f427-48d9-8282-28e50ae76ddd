The skin was separated from the underlying fascia and the bundle of wires tunneled subcutaneously from the back to each leg incision. The skin was pulled tight and the con- nector was secured on the head with dental cement. Elec- trodes wires were attached with a needle (27\" gauge), pierced perpendicular to the muscle fibbers until the stripped region of the electrode was within the muscle tissue. Two electrodes were placed at a distance of approximately 1 mm. Extra wire were looped and pushed underneath the skin ant sutured, Antibiotic and analgesic (Meloxicam, 1 mg/ml, i-p; Buprenorphine, 75 g/kg, im) were administered before surgery, the morning following surgery and observed till ful. recovery. Mice were housed alone with minimal firm obstructions within the cage in order to protect the connec- tor. Spontaneous EMG were recorded from gastrocnemius muscle (Bio-signal Technologies Inc., USA) and data were analyzed on FPGA board using customized programmes and offline analysis was performed by Spike 2 (Tysseling et al.,\n\nAnimal Model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)\n\n[0084] The inventors used Lhx1/5 double knockout mice (denoted as DKO mice) as a model of SCA. DKO mice possess ataxia phenotypes, for example decreased cerebel- lum size due to reduction of dendritic length, branching of the mutant Purkinje cells (PCs) and increased interneuron density leading to decreased molecular layer. Noticeable ataxic motor movement was observed at about 3 weeks after birth and tremor became prominent while walking on nar- row beam platform of low diameter.", "type": "Document"}}
