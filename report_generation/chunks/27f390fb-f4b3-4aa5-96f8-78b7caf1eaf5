In an exemplary embodiment, one or more braking elements 50 can be in the form a clamp 52, such as a \"C\" shaped clamp. In another exemplary embodiment, the clamp 52 can be at least partially formed of a supere- lastic or pseudoelastic material or other materials with the same properties. In a further exemplary embodiment, the braking elements 50 can be the same as the anchor member 30. [0053] Additionally or alternatively, one or more brak- ing elements 50 can be formed to provide an adjustable braking force. In an exemplary embodiment, the clamp 52 can be coated with a material, such as polyethylene, on the internal surface thereof to reduce or dissipate the correction force or energy generated by the support member 10. The correction force can be controlled by varying the coating material or the gripping force of the clamp 52. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more braking elements 50 can be in the form of an ad- justable screw or washer element 54. Depending on how tight the adjustable screw or washer element 54 is ad- justed, the braking element 50 is capable of providing a variable braking force to the support member 10, thereby controlling the correction force. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the braking elements 50 are also within the scope of the present invention. [0054] If desired, various accessory elements can be used in the correction device 1. For example, one or more restraining elements 60 can be provided to limit the sup- port member 10 from undesired movement or rotation. The restraining elements 60 can be in various forms. In an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in Fig. 6a or 6b, one or more locking elements 62 can be used to limit the movement of the support members 10,10a, and 10b. Exemplary locking elements 62 can include, but are not limited to, clamps, lockable clamps or similar devices. In an exemplary embodiment, the locking elements 62 can be in the form of \"C\" shaped clamps, which is adapted to be placed on", "type": "Document"}}
