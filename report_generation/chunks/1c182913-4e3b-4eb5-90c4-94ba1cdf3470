The processor 120 processes the audio signal AS1 with DoME based on a hearing profile and output an audio signal AS2. The enhancement weight of the FO component in the DoME is corresponding to the hearing profile, and the signal output 110 stimulates a cochlea 51 of a user 50 with the audio signal AS2.\n\nIn this embodiment, the hearing profile comprises settings either enhance/reduce existing features of the audio and/or to synthesize new features based on characteristics source audio and user calibration.\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nTo be specific, the signal output 110 may comprise loudspeaker (e.g., one or more speakers, headphones, ear- phones, headsets, earbuds, etc.), a cochlear implant (elec- tronic device), or a hearing aid (electronic device).\n\nof\n\na\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nTo be specific, the FO component of the audio signal AS1 is enhanced by adding a frequency-modulated sine consist- ing of only the FO component. Moreover, the FO component of the audio signal\u2019s AS1 dominant melody was enhanced by adding a pitch-tracked frequency-modulated sine wave in parallel to the audio signal AS1\n\nIn one embodiment, the frequency-modulated sine is added from -21.1 dB to -6.2 dB, and the effects of the DoME output an audio signal AS2 which is more pleasant to a user.\n\nIn one embodiment, the frequency-modulated sine is added from -9.6 dB to -4.3 dB below -20 LUFS, and the effects of the DoME output an audio signal AS2 which is more pleasant to a user and not having damaging or harmful loudness.\n\nOn the other hand, the frequency of the FO component ranges from 212 Hz to 1.4 kHz. The FO component is within the FO range of the average male and female spoken voice, and within the average melodic range of most targeted musical excerpts.", "type": "Document"}}
