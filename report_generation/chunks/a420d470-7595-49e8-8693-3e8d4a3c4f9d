A battery pack as claimed in claim 1, further comprising secondary energy receiving element comprising a second formed in a plane parallel to said soft magnetic sheet wherein said second coil is connected in parallel with said first coil.\n\n4. A battery pack as claimed in claim 3 wherein said second coil is formed on a printed circuit board.\n\n5.A battery pack as claimed in claim 4 wherein said printed circuit board is fixed to said soft magnetic sheet.\n\n6. A battery pack as claimed in claim 1 wherein said energy receiving element comprises a coil formed ona printed circuit board.\n\nThe equivalent circuit 1900 of this invention when used with the planar inductive charger is shown in FIG. 19. Unlike that reported by Choi (FIG. 5), the multilayer winding array that generates a uniform magnetic field over the charging surface (primary system) can be represented as groups of windings that can be connected to the high-frequency AC inverter in series, in parallel or a combination of both. When the secondary loads are placed on the charging surface, near field coupling and therefore energy transfer occur between the charging platform and the secondary loads.\n\n7. A battery pack as claimed in claim 1 wherein said diode rectifier is a voltage doubler.\n\n8. A battery pack as claimed in claim 1 wherein said diode rectifier and said DC capacitor are formed as part of attery charging circuit.\n\n9. A battery pack as claimed in claim 1 further comprising voltage regulator for regulating the output of the rectifier battery charging circuit.", "type": "Document"}}
