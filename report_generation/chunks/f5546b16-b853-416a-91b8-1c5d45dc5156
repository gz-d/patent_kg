The method is useful in prevent or treatment of an infection caused by a flavivirus, an enterovirus or a lentivirus.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nwherein the flavivirus infection is caused by Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus or Dengue virus.\n\nRNA viruses, such as viruses from Flaviviridae, Enterovirus and Coronavirus are expanding threat in public health. West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and enterovirus A17 (EV- A17) are considered as the leading causes of human and animal infectious diseases in the world. The morbidity and mortality of related illness caused by these viruses have been increasing every year. West Nile virus has recently spread from the Mediterranean Basin to the Western Hemisphere and now accounts for thousands of sporadic encephalitis cases each year. Also, Japanese encephalitis have caused thousands of deaths each year in a wide range of endemic\n\n[0007] Ina second aspect, the present invention pertains to a method of inhibiting the entry ofa flavivirus into host cells, comprising contacting the host cells with an effective amount of berbamine or its analogue, berbamine has a structure of Formula (1):\n\nFormula (D", "type": "Document"}}
