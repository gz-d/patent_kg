In other words, it is inevitable for the device to experience different deformation and/or damages during routine usage or long-term usage. Furthermore, one desir- able feature of a flexible/wearable electronic device may be weather resistant. That is, the device may be operated under harsh environments. For example, it may be desirable for a smart watch being operable under water during diving or being operable in a cold environment with a temperature of ice or even lower.\n\n[0135] The battery 100 may optionally or additionally include an encapsulating layer 112 that receives and encases the electrodes 102, 104 and the electrolyte 106. The encap- sulating layer 112 may be formed in any suitable shape such as for example a cylinder or a planar shape or any other suitable shape. The encapsulating layer 112 may be formed from a suitable material such as epoxy or a polymer. Preferably, the encapsulating layer 112 may be capable of preventing water from escaping from the battery.\n\n[0130] Accordingly, it may be preferable to provide a hydrogel electrolyte that is capable of retaining its water content under extreme temperature as well as maintaining its mechanical properties under such temperature. It may also be preferable to provide an electrical energy storage device containing said electrolyte such that the device may be operable with stable electrochemical performance under various harsh conditions such as mechanical deformations, and even under ice or boiling water.", "type": "Document"}}
