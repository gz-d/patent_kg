It can be seen that the results are in good agreement, especially for the patterns in the E-plane. In this example, as the coupling strength of the coupled oscillator array in the E-plane is high, the phase error due to the device mismatch is not obvious, and so the array can maintain a relatively ideal out-of-phase coupling mode in that plane. In this example, in contrast, the coupling strength is weaker for the in-phase coupling mode due to the smaller injection current, as\n\nillustrated in the equivalent circuit in FIG. 5. [0204] Based on the measured E- and H-plane patterns at\n\ndifferent frequencies, the corresponding directivities are calculated and compared with the simulated values. FIG. 22B shows simulated and calculated directivities of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array. It is found that the calculated directivities from the measured two planes are about 1 dB lower compared to the corresponding simulated values, which is different from the well-matched patterns as illustrated in FIG. 22A. In this example, the simulated directivity is calculated based on the whole 3D radiation field distribution but the calculated directivity is an average result of only two measured planes, thus this may result in error, especially with different beamwidths in the two the simulated for radi-\n\nFIG. 23B.\n\nIt is found that the simulated DC", "type": "Document"}}
