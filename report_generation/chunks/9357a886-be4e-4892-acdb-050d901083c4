Using a mobile phone as an example, the battery pack is usually accommodated inside the mobile phone and is covered by the back cover of the mobile phone. Ifa mobile phone is placed on the planar inductive battery charging platform of FIG. 2, one side of the battery pack will face the charging surface of the charging platform. This side will be called the \u201cactive side\u201d of the battery pack in this specification because it is closest to the charging surface of the charging platform and will be used for inductive charging purposes. There will be only the back cover (usually made of plastic) of the mobile phone between the active side of the\n\n(square or rectangular or other polygonal shape) enclosed with a winding and (b) a thin soft magnetic sheet (circular or oval shape) to form an energy pick-up coil as well as an inductor in an embodiment of the invention,\n\nFIGS. 12(a) and (6) show an energy pick-up coil according an embodiment of the invention consisting of a spiral and a concentrated winding connected in parallel,\n\nFIG. 13(a)-(c) show (a) a schematic diagram of an embodi- ment of the invention, (b) the circuit diagram of one embodi- ment of the invention, and (c) the circuit diagram of another embodiment of the invention,\n\nFIG. 14 shows a functional block diagram of the proposed. circuit connected to a battery pack in a charged electronic equipment,", "type": "Document"}}
