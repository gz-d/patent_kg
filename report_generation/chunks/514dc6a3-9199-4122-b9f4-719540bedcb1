For examples, inspection of smart- building windows incorporated photovoltaic devices, or even electrical vehicles (EVs) equipped with photovoltaic modules when parking in a street.\n\n40\n\nG.3 shows a detailed view of an internal structure of the photovoltaic module under inspection; 4\n\nFIG. 4 shows a simplified setup for inspection of photovoltaic system;\n\nFIG. 5 shows a voltage-current characteristic for a generic device;\n\nPV\n\nG. 6 shows an apparatus for facilitating a photovoltaic device to provide a wireless communication channel accord- to one embodiment of the present invention; \u672c\n\ning\n\nRecent developments in photovoltaic (PV) technology have made solar power a viable alternative for powering unmanned vehicles. It is always desirable to have a cost- effective way of wireless communication between unmanned vehicles and the infrastructures/utilities being inspected.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n45\n\n50\n\nG. 7 shows operation mechanism of a state machine to the present invention; 4\n\naccording\n\nFIG. 8 shows how the apparatus according to the present invention can be connected with a PV cell, a substring of PV cells and a PV module including one or more substrings PV cells;\n\n\u53ef\n\nG. 9 shows how the apparatus according to the present invention is connected across a pair bus-bars (terminal+ and terminal-) on front side and back sides of a generic crys- talline photovoltaic cell;", "type": "Document"}}
