For example the ratio of the opening to the top area of the evaporation chamber is greater than 4. Preferably the evaporating and supply means is removable from said appa- ratus.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nFocused Electric Field Enhanced Plasma-Based Ion Implantation (FEFE-PBII) relates to a process for focused electric field enhanced plasma apparatus and methods and the following plasma-based ion implantation. One of the tech- niques belonging to the family of plasma-based ion implan- tation is plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII), which is a useful niche technology for the modification of surface prop- erties of materials and industrial components, especially such materials and components that are large or that have an irregu- lar shape. The samples are immersed in plasma from which ions are extracted and implanted in the surface of the samples.", "type": "Document"}}
