While breakthroughs in bio-inspired engineer- ing have achieved a wide range of structures that enable various fascinating functionalities, it remains a daunting challenge to mimic structural hierarchy, material diversity, and functional sophistication of living organisms in a facile and reproducible manner. So far, these exquisite morpholo- gies are generally achieved on rigid materials such as polystyrene (PS) and silicon using expensive and sophisti- cated microfabrication technologies and/or two-photon 3D printing technologies. More importantly, these rigid engi- neered structures are mechanically vulnerable to external load because of the concentration of high local stress during their deformation, chemically susceptible to corrosives, topologically limited, and optically less attractive, thereby preventing real-life applications. Thus, it is timely to develop affordable and scalable strategies that enable the attainment of structural and functional diversity on more\n\n[0074] Important New Functions of Structured Materials", "type": "Document"}}
