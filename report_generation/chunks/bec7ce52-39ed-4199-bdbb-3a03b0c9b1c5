The memory unit 304 and the disk drive 312 may be operated by the processor 302. The information handling system 300 also preferably includes a communication device 310 for establishing one or more communication links (not shown) with one or more other computing devices such as servers, personal computers, terminals, tablets, phones, or other wireless or handheld computing devices. The commu- nication device 310 may be a modem, a Network Interface Card (NIC), an integrated network interface, a radio fre- quency transceiver, an optical port, an infrared port, a USB connection, or other wired or wireless communication inter- faces. The communication links may be wired or wireless for communicating commands, instructions, information and/or data. Preferably, the processor 302, the memory unit 304, and optionally the input devices 306, the output devices 308, the communication device 310 and the disk drives 312 are connected with each other through a bus, a Periphera Component Interconnect (PCI) such as PCI Express, a Universal Serial Bus (USB), an optical bus, or other like bus structure. In one embodiment, some of these components are connected through a network such as the Internet or a cloud computing network. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that the information handling system 300 shown in FIG. 5 is merely exemplary and different information handling systems 300 with different configurations may be\n\nA=A-B'sin \u4e2d\n\nB=Breos 4\n\nBy making A' and B' the subject of the equations:\n\nClearly, when \u00a2 is small (e.g., B' can be approximated by: less than 10\u00b0, etc.), A\u2019 and\n\nA'A4Besin \u4e2d\n\nBUB\n\nIn other words, when \u4e2d is small (e.g., \u4e2d less than 10\u00b0, etc.):\n\nA=A-Besin \u7531\n\nB-B'", "type": "Document"}}
