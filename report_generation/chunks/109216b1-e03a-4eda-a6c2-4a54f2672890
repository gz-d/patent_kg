The main patch 204A includes a central portion 204A1 and two side portions 204A2, 204A3 arranged on two sides of the central portion 204A1. The central portion 204A1 includes two generally U-shaped slots 220 disposed. symmetrically about an axis of symmetry (in x-direction) of the main patch 204A. Each of the U-shaped slots 220 is associated with a respective open stub (surrounded by a dotted loop near 220), a 4,/4 open stub (A, is the guided wavelength). Each of the side portions 204A2, 204A3 include a dual-stub or a dual-stub feed 222.
