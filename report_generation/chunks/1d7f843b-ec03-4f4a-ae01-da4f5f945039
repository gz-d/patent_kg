A circuit for an electronic device having a non-planar transparent resonator element wherein the transparent reso- nator element at least partially occupy a footprint of a photo- voltaic element of the circuit and wherein said transparent resonator element forms part of a light pathway for transmit- ting light to said photovoltaic element.\n\n2. The circuit of claim 1, wherein the resonator element is shaped so as to focus light impinging on a surface thereof.\n\n3. The circuit of claim 1, wherein the resonator element is transparent to light at and/or beyond optical frequencies.\n\nIn the claims appended hereto, references to electronic circuit or electronic system are to be taken as comprising references also to photonic integrated circuits or systems and opto-electronic circuits or systems.\n\n4. The circuit of claim 1, wherein the resonator element comprises borosilicate glass.\n\n\u00a7. The circuit of claim 1, wherein the resonator element shaped such that light impinging on a surface of said resona- element is focused by the resonator element towards selected region of another surface of the resonator element.\n\nIn general, the invention provides a circuit for a device having a non-planar transparent DRA. The transparent DR is mounted on another component so as to at least partially occupy a footprint of another component of the circuit. The transparent DR forms part of a light pathway on said circuit for transmitting light to or from said another component. Also provided is a transparent dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) for optical applications. Since the DR is transparent, it can let light pass through itself and, thus, the light can be utilized by\n\n6.
