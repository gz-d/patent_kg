As mentioned above, reactive functional groups fabricated on the titanium substrate surfaces by pressurized hydrothermal treatment (or PIII&D) may also contain antimicrobial functions. Alternatively, these func- tional groups can also be regarded as an intermediate surface to facilitate the formation of linker molecules such as APTES such that the antimicrobial substances such as chitosan and antibacterial peptides can aggregate on the surface of implantable titanium alloys. [0039] In an embodiment, the implantable titanium al- loy with a layer of hydroxide functional groups (-OH) can be established by submerging the metal (titanium alloy)", "type": "Document"}}
