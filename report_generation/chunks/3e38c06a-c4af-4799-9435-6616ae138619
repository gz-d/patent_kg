The processor of claim 3, wherein the AXI memory interconnect is arranged to read and write computation data via a data memory controller of the software processor, and to exchange the computation data with the plurality of hardware accelerator modules of the hardware processor through an AX] protocol.\n\n5. The processor of claim 4, wherein the hardware pro- cessor further comprises a DMA intermedium arranged to facilitate exchanging the computation data between the AX] memory interconnect and the plurality of hardware accel- erator modules through the AXI protocol.\n\n6. The processor of claim 5, wherein the software pro- cessor is arranged to control transfer of computation data and passes configured parameters of the hardware processor through an AX] lite protocol via the AXI peripheral inter- connect.\n\n7. The processor of claim 6, wherein the AXI lite periph- eral interconnect is arranged to read and write a plurality of control registers associated with the plurality of hardware accelerator modules in the hardware processor through the AXI-Lite protocol.\n\n8. The processor of claim 1, wherein the plurality hardware accelerator modules includes an NTT transforma- tion module arranged to accelerate multiplication of two polynomials.\n\n9. The processor of claim 8, wherein the NTT transfor- mation module is a hybrid NTT/Inverse-NTT (INTT) trans- formation module configurable to operate in a selected one of an NTT mode or an INTT mode.\n\n10. The processor of claim 9, wherein the NTT transfor- mation module is arranged to operate according to an NTT finite state transition with following states:\n\nreceiving two polynomials from an input FIFO of the hardware processor to a first RAM unit in the NTT transformation module in a read state;\n\nof\n\n15\n\nMay 2, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
