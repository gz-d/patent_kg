For each concentration of the agent, 6 ml of culture medium is to be added to twenty embryos cultured in a Petri dish. Fifteen replications per agent per concentration (i.e. 20x15=300 embryos for each concentration of an agent) are then tested. The effect could be observed at different time points, e.g. 28 hpf, 52 hpf or 76 hpf. Furthermore, the further experiments to examine toxicity and angiogenesis can be performed following agent treatment.\n\nTo examine pro-/anti-angiogenic activity induced by a compound, the number of intersegmental vessels is required to be counted under a stereomicroscope or a compound. microscope. Stained embryos are positioned laterally in glyc- erol. The region of examination is from the first intersegmen- tal vessels to the one just above the anus. In general, there should be 12-13 pairs. The advantage is that there is a constant number of intersegmental vessels in 3-day embryos which makes the comparison between the control and treatment groups easier. Another advantage of using the zebrafish for this type of assay is that the subintestinal vessels, which are located over the yolk, are both sensitive to factors which affect vessel formation and are easily assayed by this method. The subintestinal vessels are normally present on the dorso- lateral surface of the yolk of zebrafish embryos by 48 hours of development. They form a distinct basket shape that extends 50-100 hm from the ventral edge of the somite over the yolk. By assaying the subintestinal vessels at 72 hours of develop- ment (24 hours after the subintestinal vessels normally appear), the normal variation in the timing of the vessel for- mation is avoided.\n\nc.
