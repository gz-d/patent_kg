The target temperature and time depend on the thickness of nanosheets, such as at 350\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes for thick- ness=20 nm.\n\n[0066] Inone embodiment, the PVA solution was prepared adding commercial PVA powder (purchased from Shan- dong Usolf Chemical Technology with the grade of 0588) into deionized water, and the PVA hydrogel has a mass fraction of 5-15%.\n\nby\n\n[0067] In one embodiment, when preparing the 2D free- standing organic-metal nanosheets, the structure of the organic layer in the exfoliated organic-metal sheets is dif- ferent from the pristine PVA polymer, which assists is preparing the core-shell nanoparticles. This 1s particularly true for high-energy deposition processes such as sputtering as the energy of the metal particle impacting the polymer can cause structural changes and partial carbonization.\n\n[0068] In one embodiment, the water flowing was kept gently during delamination to maintain the integrity of nanosheets. Further, in order to speed up delamination, film can be cut into some small rectangles, or the deionized water can be heated to 40-50\u00b0 C.\n\nthe\n\nthe", "type": "Document"}}
