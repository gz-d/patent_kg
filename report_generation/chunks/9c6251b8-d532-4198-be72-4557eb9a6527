From the energy point of view, continuous impinging droplets also serve as soft, configurable transformers that dynamically regulate the efficient hydrodynamic-to- electrical energy conversion. Thus, by careful control of the synergistic cooperation among the source/virtual source, drain and gate, it has been shown that continuous and efficient electricity generation Is achievable by translating the conventional interfacial effect into a desirable bulk effect from the sustainable source, such as raindrop, in an on-demand manner.\n\nFig. 2a shows the optical image of the as-fabricated transparent TIDE-G with four individual", "type": "Document"}}
