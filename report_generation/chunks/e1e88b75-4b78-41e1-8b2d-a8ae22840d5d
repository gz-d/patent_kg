An in vivo zebrafish assay would eliminate those lead compounds, due to the toxic effects, from the list identified from the in vitro assays before entering a more expensive phase of in vivo validation. An in vivo zebrafish assay has been demonstrated as a useful method for screening angio- genic drugs (reviewed by (Kidd and Weinstein, 2003)). For example, Serbedzija and his coworkers described a screening methodology which was based on the counting number of subintestinal blood vessels formed on the surface of the yolk on both side of the embryo (Serbedzija et al., 1999). Blood vessels were stained for endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Transgenic zebrafish lines with fluorescent blood vessels have been developed (Cross et al., 2003; Lawson and Weinstein, 2002) such that the imaging and analysis of angio- genesis can be greatly simplified. However, there is still no methodology describing fully the procedures and tools how zebrafish may be used as a quantitative tool for angiogenic\n\nThis application is a 371 of PCT/CN2007/000034 application filed on Jan. 8, 2007.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
