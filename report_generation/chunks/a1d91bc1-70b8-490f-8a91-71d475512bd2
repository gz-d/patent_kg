[0024] In another embodiment, an optimization of the composition, sequence and amount of the antimicrobial peptide and the species of linker molecules connecting antimicrobial peptide and the substrate can be involved when immobilizing the peptide on the material surface. For example, the composition, sequence and amount of the antimicrobial peptide and the species of linker mole- cules connecting antimicrobial peptide and the titanium substrate may also alter its antimicrobial ability when im- mobilizing the peptides on the material surface. Thermal treatment and/or radiation treatment to the biomaterials such as the titanium alloy can further be involved during the fabrication process so as to enhance the antimicrobial properties of these surface layers and alloys. [0025] In order to better understand the present inven- tion, a titanium alloy treated by PIII&D oxygen will be used as one of examples to highlight its antibacterial properties and biocompatibility.", "type": "Document"}}
