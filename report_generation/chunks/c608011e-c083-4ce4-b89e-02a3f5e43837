In the embodiment, the sensor includes a source unit 100, an interferometric unit 200, a SPR sensing unit 400, and detection unit 500. The source unit 100 is configured to generate a polychromatic parallel light beam containing p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam. The inter- ferometric unit 200 includes a common-path interferometric unit 210 for introducing birefringent retardation between the two polarized light beams, so that an optical path difference is generated between the p-polarized beam and the s-polarized beam. The SPR sensing unit 400 is disposed to introduce the SPR effect associated with a target sample to the p-polarized probe beam while keeping the s-polarized reference beam which traverses the same path unaffected. The detection unit 500 is disposed to detect target sample characteristics by obtaining an interference spectrum of the p-polarized beam and the s-polarized beam from the SPR sensing unit.\n\nAccording to another aspect of the present application, a method for detecting characteristics of a target sample is provided. The method includes generating, from a source unit, a polychromatic light beam containing p-polarized beam and s-polarized beam; introducing, by an interferomet- ric unit, birefringent retardation for generating optical path difference between the p-polarized beam and the s-polarized. beam; introducing a SPR effect associated with the target sample to the p-polarized beam; detecting target sample char- acteristics by obtaining an interference spectrum of the p-po- larized beam and the s-polarized beam from the SPR sensing unit.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 2, the optical light source unit 100 may comprise a broadband polychromatic electromagnetic radia- tion source 101, a spatial filter 102, a collimator 103, and broadband linear polarizer 104,", "type": "Document"}}
