It is\n\n(around.\n\nthat the duration of\n\n[0153] suggested biodegradable microneedle patches in vivo varies subject to different molecular weights of PLGA. An in vitro degradation test is performed on microneedles prepared by different PLGAs. The PLGA I microneedles are degraded fast while PLGA I microneedles still remain stable within 5 days and start degraded after 20 days in PBS solution at 37\u00b0 C. The PLGA III microneedles show obvious degradation cues even after 20 days, thus PLGA II is selected as the material o preparing microneedle patches. The representative H&E staining image of muscle tissue inserted by PLGA I microneedle shows the obvious tip holes (FIG. 1L), indi- cating the sufficient mechanical property of the PLGA I microneedle for tissue insertion.\n\npatch\n\n[0154] Turning to FIGS. 2A-2I, electrical performances o: the present device are evaluated. It is provided that the modulator of radio frequency power supply to a transmis- sion antenna (transmission coil) is disposed near the har- vester for delivering electric current to the interface region of the tissue. The radio frequency power transfer relies on magnetic coupling, where there is no obvious resonant frequency change even the whole antenna is bent with a radius of 0.9 cm (FIG. 2A). FIG. 2B shows that the open- circuit output voltage (~10V) is generated under a continu- ous radio frequency power (~5 Vpp at a 0 mm coupling distance) applied to the transmission coil.
