The signal output 110 provide the audio signal AS2 to the cochlea 51 of the user 50. The cochlear implant includes electrodes attached to the cochlea 51, and the audio signal AS2 is electrical signal transferred from the audio signal after DoME.\n\nReferring to FIG. 5. The audio processing system 10A similar to the audio processing system 10. In comparison, the audio processing system 10A further includes an input device 130, input device 150, and processor 140.\n\nthe\n\nis\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nReferring to FIG. 6. The audio processing system 10B is similar to the audio processing system 10A. Besides having the signal output 110 of the audio processing system 10, the audio processing system 10B has an acoustic device 160. The acoustic device 160 is electrically connected to the processor 120, and the acoustic device 160 outputs the audio signal AS2 to the user 50 afier receiving from the processor 120.\n\nMoreover, the acoustic device 160 may be a loudspeaker, headphones, earphones, headsets, or earbuds.\n\nReferring to FIG. 7. The system 200 can be used as a server or other information processing systems in other embodiments of the present invention, and the system 200 may be configured to execute implementations of the meth- ods (e.g., the audio signal processing methods) under the embodiments of the present invention.\n\nThe audio processing system 200 may have different configurations, and it generally comprises suitable compo- nents necessary to receive, store, and execute appropriate computer instructions, commands, or codes.", "type": "Document"}}
