This design effec- tively reduces the data transfer between the software and the hardware. Furthermore, a unified pipeline architecture, which tightly integrated Keccak core with samplers, is designed for the SHAKE. The tightly coupled architecture can effectively reduce the inter- mediate data transmission between the software and the hardware.\n\n[0133] All or portions of the methods in accordance to the embodiments may be executed in one or more computing devices including server computers, personal computers, laptop computers, mobile computing devices such as smart- phones and tablet computers.\n\n[0134] The embodiments may include computer storage media, transient and non-transient memory devices having computer instructions or software codes stored therein, which can be used to program or configure the computing devices, computer processors, or electronic circuitries to perform any of the processes of the present invention. The storage media, transient and non-transient memory devices can include, but are not limited to, floppy disks, optical discs, Blu-ray Disc, DVD, CD-ROMs, and magneto-optica\u2019 disks, ROMs, RAMs, flash memory devices, or any type o: media or devices suitable for storing instructions, codes, and/or data.\n\n[0135] Each of the functional units and modules in accor- dance with various embodiments also may be implemented in distributed computing environments and/or Cloud com- puting environments, wherein the whole or portions o machine instructions are executed in distributed fashion by one or more processing devices interconnected by a com- munication network, such as an intranet, Wide Area Net- work (WAN), Local Area Network (LAN), the Internet, and other forms of data transmission medium.", "type": "Document"}}
