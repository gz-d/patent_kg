The DMA interacts with the hardware accelerator modules in the hardware processor 102 through input FIFO 108A and output FIFO 108B. The read and write interrupt signals of the DMA pass to the IRQ port through the concat IP. The processor controls the DMA data transfer and passes configured parameters via the GP ports by using AX] lite protocol. The AXI memory interconnect and AXI peripheral interconnect are the intermediate medium between the endpoint IPs and the PS. Their main tasks include memory mapping, bit width conversion, and. clock conversion. The AXI stream data transmission in this design uses a 64-bit bus, while the AX] lite control signal uses a 32-bit bus. All modules on the PL operate under the same frequency. Alternatively, computation/control data/ signal may be programmed in other bit-lengths in other\n\n[0058] FIG. 1 illustrates an example top level software/ hardware co-design architecture. The system is designed according to the Xilinx Zynq SoC architecture, which includes the Processing System (PS) (i.e. the software processor 104) and the Programmable Logic (PL) (i.e. the hardware processor 102). The Advanced eXtensible Inter- face (AXD standard is used for the interconnection between the PS and PL. The software runs on the ARM processor on the PS while the designed hardware accelerator runs on the reconfigurable logics on the PL.\n\n[0059] In addition, the software processor 104 is arranged to contro] transfer of computation data and passes config- ured parameters of the hardware processor 102 through an AX] lite protocol via the AX] peripheral interconnect, in which the AXI lite peripheral interconnect is arranged to read and write a plurality of control registers associated with the plurality of hardware accelerator modules in the hard- ware processor 102 through the AXI-Lite protocol.\n\napplications.", "type": "Document"}}
