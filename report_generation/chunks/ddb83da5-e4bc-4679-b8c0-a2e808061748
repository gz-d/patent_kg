To determine the baseline of background biotinylation, an empty gRNA vector is used in the present invention to perform a control CARPID. The protein identification base: on mass spectrometry (MS) shows that most of the detecte proteins with at least two peptides (447 proteins) are shared between different gRNA groups and in triplicate of each group, which indicates that CARPID has strong repeatability (FIG. 6a, FIG. 66).\n\n[0106] For the enrichment analysis, label-free MS quan- titation and non-parametric rank product test are applied in the present invention, the enrichment cut-off value is >2 times, and the adjusted p value is <0.05. The results show that at least one group of gRNA significantly enriched in 73 XIST interaction proteins compared with the vector control group (FIG. 1c). In addition, 23 of the 73 proteins are found to have at least two different groups of gRNAs, and 13 of which are shared by all three gRNA pairs (FIG. 1d; FIG. 6c). Previous studies have reported more than a quarter (19/73) of these strong XIST interaction proteins (FIG. 1d), includ- ing a variety of functionally verified conjugates: Cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC1A, an ATP-dependent helicase ATRX, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling agent BRG1. It is also noted in the present invention that some known XIST interactive RBPs, such as SPEN and RBM15, are not in this list. The inventors believe that their binding to XIST may be weak or dynamic in living cells, and are difficult to enrich.", "type": "Document"}}
