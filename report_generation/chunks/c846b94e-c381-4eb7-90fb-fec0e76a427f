The study revealed that Sirt4 is the first mammalian enzyme that can modulate PDH activity through delipoylation in living cells. However, it was noted that the delipoylation activity of Sirt4 in vitro was rather weak, especially when compared with the deacetylation activity of sirtuins. This raises an question: whether there are other enzymes that can erase lysine lipoylation more efli- ciently in the native cellular environment.\n\n[0015] wherein R, is a photo-crosslinking group.\n\n[0016] In certain embodiments, R, is a C5 straight alkyl chain substituted with diazirine, phenyl azide, ortho-hy- droxyphenyl azide, meta-hydroxyphenyl azide, tetrafluoro- phenyl azide, ortho-nitrophenyl azide, meta-nitrophenyl azide, azido-methylcoumarin, or psoralen.\n\n[0006] To this end, the present invention provides a robust chemical tool to aid in understanding the biological func- tions of lysine lipoylation. Specifically, the present invention provides a compound, the first aflinity-based probe, referred to herein as \u201cKPlip\u201d, capable of interrogating the lipoylated peptide/protein interactions under native cellular environ- ments. The chemical probe allows for the identification of potential regulators of lysine lipoylation, thus uncovering new biology related to lipoylation.\n\n[0017] In certain embodiments the photo-crosslinking group comprises a diazirine.\n\n[0018] In certain embodiments R, is:\n\n[0007] Until now, no single-step fluorescent probe has been developed to report delipoylation activity. The present invention also provides a fluorogenic probe, KTlip, to detect delipoylation activity in a continuous manner.
