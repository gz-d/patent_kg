One example is the desire to have radio-on-fiber links to simultaneously carry microwave radio signals and high-speed millimeter-wave signals. Another impetus comes from the endeavor to design wide- band communication systems that comply with 4G, 5G, and future wireless standards that include millimeter-wave bands. Coverage of two or more widely-separated wave bands may thus be desirable.\n\n[0011] Preferably, the opposite side surfaces are generally parallel.\n\n[0012] Preferably, the opposite side surfaces are separated a first distance, and the first distance is at least half-wavelength distance.\n\n[0013] Optionally, the groove includes a first portion at the middle and second and third portions at two ends. At the first portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a first distance; at the second portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a second distance; at the third portion, the opposite side surfaces are separated by a third distance. The first distance is larger than the second distance and the third distance. Preferably, the first distance is at least a half- wavelength distance. Preferably, the second distance equals the third distance.\n\n[0003] Thus, there is a need for an antenna, in particular multi- (e.g., dual-) frequency antenna with a high-frequency ratio, to cover two or more widely-separated frequency/ wave bands.\n\n[0004] Some existing systems/methods provide such antennas by using two or more radiators, either vertically stacked or horizontally arranged, each operating at a differ- ent frequency band. These systems/methods may provide a high frequency ratio, but they are relatively heavy and bulky.", "type": "Document"}}
