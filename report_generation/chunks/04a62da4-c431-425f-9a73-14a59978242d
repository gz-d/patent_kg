The EMSHMM provides quantitative measures of individual differences in cognitive behavior/style, making a significant impact on the use of eye tracking to study cognitive behavior across disciplines.\n\nwo\n\nCO-\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nEYE MOVEMENT ANALYSIS WITH CO-CLUSTERING OF HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS (EMHMM WITH CO-CLUSTERING) AND WITH SWITCHING HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS (EMSHMM)\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\na\n\nRecent research has shown that\n\nhave", "type": "Document"}}
