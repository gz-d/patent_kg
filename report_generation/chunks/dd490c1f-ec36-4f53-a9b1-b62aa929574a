When excited by a high-frequency ac voltage generated by a power electronic circuit, a high-frequency ac magnetic flux is created in the spiral winding. This magnetic flux points in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the spiral winding. Protected by a layer of electrical insulator, the ac excited spiral winding provides an induction surface, When a secondary element such as a metallic cooking pot is placed on top of the electrically insulated surface of the spiral primary winding, current wil! be induced in the secondary metallic material by induction due to the ac magnetic flux created in the spiral primary winding. The conduction loss due to the induced current in the secondary element causes heating of the\n\nsecondary clement.\n\nPRIOR ART\n\n25\n\nSimilar induction heating equipment using a single spiral winding for drying printing materials has been proposed by Elgee et al in US patent 6,349,671. Ulrich ot al proposed an induction heating system using a flexible coil in US patent 6,346,690 and US patent 6,229,126, The flexible coil is wound in a concentric manner and is fed by a power supply. There are limitations in using a single spiral winding as the inductive element. First, the magnetic field distribution is not\n\n20\n\n25\n\nC\n\nthe\n\nand the", "type": "Document"}}
