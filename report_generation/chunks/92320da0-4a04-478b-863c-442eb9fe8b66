Notably, the spectrum of the cross section of the AD-gel exhibited several absorption bands at 1654 cm (N\u2014H stretching vibration) and 3448 cm! (C\u2014O stretch- ing vibration), which were abscribed to the typical absorp- tion bands of PAM gel matrix. Referring to the spectrum of the surface of the AD-gel, the characteristic peaks at 790 cm! and 1060 cm\u2122! were assigned to the Si \u4e00 O stretching vibration of PDMS silane. These results confirm the exis- tence of elastomeric coating onto the surface of the organo-\n\n[0217] \u2018To further verify the anti-dehydration property of the AD-gel electrolyte, the AD-gel and PAM-hydrogel elec- trolytes were placed in a -20\u00b0 C. freeze-dryer or a 80\u00b0 C. oven for 24 h (FIG. 10A). The PAM-hydrogel was freeze- dried in cold or transformed into a dried bulk polymer in hot, while the AD-gel electrolyte remained soft and elastic in both the harsh conditions. As illustrated in FIG. 10B, it is also shown that the weight ratio of the PAM-hydrogel electrolyte was reduced to 0.6 and 0.3 under said cold and hot conditions, respectively.
