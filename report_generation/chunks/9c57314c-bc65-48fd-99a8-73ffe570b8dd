Pre-scaled quantizing means that the quan- tization step for each coefficient is scaled according to the location of the coefficient in the integer transformed residual block F*. This has the effect of making the integer image transform orthogonal (which is required by most video and image encoding processes). In other words, the necessary scaling of the integer transform is integrated into the quanti- zation process.\n\npredict the real distortion accurately, and therefore they lead selection of sub-optimum encoding modes which have higher bit rate or higher distortion than the optimum.\n\nA rate-distortion performance comparison of H.264/AVC using RDO-based, SAD-based and SATD-based cost func- tions for different QPs (quantization step sizes) and three well-known test sequences in terms of PSNR and bit-rate is shown in the table in FIG. 1. As can be seen from the table, compared with a RDO-based encoder, the SAD-based and SATD-based cost functions are not good at selecting the mode having the best (lowest) rate-distortion cost.\n\nIn summary, computing the rate-distortion cost (hereinaf- ter also referred to as rate-distortion) of each mode directly from the source and reconstructed blocks takes a lot of pro- cessing power and is not practical to carry out in real time without high end computing hardware. Meanwhile using the SAD and SADT functions are not good at predicting the real rate-distortion caused by the encoding process and may result in sub-optimum modes being selected.", "type": "Document"}}
