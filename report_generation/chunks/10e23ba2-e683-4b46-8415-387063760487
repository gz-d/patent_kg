As shown in FIG. 14, the measured and simulated peak gains are 11.30 and 11.93 dBi respectively. Both the measured and simulated results are consistently higher than 10 dBi across the impedance passband.\n\n1. An antenna, comprising:\n\na dielectric block with a groove, and a conductor arranged in the groove;\n\n[0063] FIG. 15 shows the total antenna efficiency of the wideband Fabry-Perot resonator antenna of the antenna 300 of FIG. 7, which is obtained from the measured realized gain and directivity. FIG. 15 shows that the total antenna efli- ciency varies from 56.5% to 86.4% over the 10 dB imped- ance bandwidth. The highest efficiency of 86.4% is lower than that (95.4%) of the wideband dielectric resonator antenna, which is acceptable because the Fabry-Perot reso- nator antenna operates at a much higher frequency.\n\nwherein the antenna is arranged to be excited to operate as a dielectric resonator antenna and a Fabry-Perot resonator antenna.\n\n2. The antenna of claim 1, wherein the dielectric block is substantially solid.\n\n3. The antenna of claim 1, wherein the groove extends through the dielectric block from a first end of the dielectric block to a second end of the dielectric block, the first and second ends being opposite ends.", "type": "Document"}}
