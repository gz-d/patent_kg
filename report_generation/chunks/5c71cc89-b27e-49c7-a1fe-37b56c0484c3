Therefore, the fore- going statements of object are not exhaustive and serve merely to illustrate some of the many objects of the present invention.\n\nAnadvantage of switching regulators is efficiency, as mini- mal power is dissipated in the power path (often FET switches) when the output supply voltage is sufficient for the load state. Essentially, the power converter \u201cshuts off\u2019 when is not needed, due to minimal switch duty-cycle.
