The plurality of thermoelec- tric modules 110-110C are arranged adjacent each other in a series arrangement on the flexible substrate 102. Each ther- moelectric module 110 comprises a p type semiconductor element 112 and a n type semiconductor element 114, all positioned on the flexible substrate 102. Each thermoelectric module generates an electric current i.e. electricity when exposed to heat. The temperature difference created due to the application of heat to the thermoelectric device causes an electric current to be generated by way of the Seebeck effect. The p type semiconductor element and the n type semicon- ductor element are positioned adjacent each other or in contact with each other. The thermoelectric device 100 comprises a plurality of conductor members 116. Each p type semiconductor element 112 and n type semiconductor element 114 are coupled together by the conductor member 116. Each of the semiconductor elements within each ther- moelectric module are interconnected to each other by\n\n[0146] The conductor member 116 is positioned perpen- dicular to the semiconductor elements 112, 114. A longitu- dinal axis of each conductor member 116 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A of each semicon- ductor element ie. leg 112, 114. The conductor members 116 are formed from a metal or another suitable electric con- ductor. For example, each conductor member 116 comprises aluminium or copper foil and it operates as an output contact. Each conductor member is a metal foil having a thickness between 25 nm to 75 nm. Preferably the thickness of the metal foil of the conductor member 116 is 50 nm.", "type": "Document"}}
