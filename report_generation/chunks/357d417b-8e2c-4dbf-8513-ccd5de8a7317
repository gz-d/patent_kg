Previous studies showed that participants have preferred fixated features or fixation locations during subjective decision-making. For example, it was found that attractive and unattractive features received more attention than those with intermediate attractiveness and brands located at the center of a shelf in shops were more likely to be chosen. Because individuals differ in how they obtain information from the stimuli of choice during decision making, or in a cognitive task in general, the methods of the instant invention using an EMSHMM toolbox (see Chuk et al., 2014) capture these individual differences by inferring personalized ROIs on each stimulus using a Gaussian mixture model approach and enable the determination of the optimal number of ROIs for each participant trough the Bayesian method. Advantageously, using a larger number of high-level states, the EMSHMM method is able to discover more fine-grained cognitive states in between the exploration and preference-biased periods in terms of similarity. For example, in more complex cognitive tasks such as driving or cooking,\n\nwith a large number of high-level states the instant method enables the detection of more\n\ndiscrete cognitive states essential to the task and their associated eye movement patterns.", "type": "Document"}}
