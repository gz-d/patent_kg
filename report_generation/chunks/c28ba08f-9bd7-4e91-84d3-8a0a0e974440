Power adaptors (or AC-DC pow- er converters) are traditionally used to charge the batter- ies in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic products, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable elec- tronic equipment. [0003] Recently, two proposals for planar inductive charging platforms have been proposed. The first one proposed in patent application GB2399225A and also described in related patent application US 2005/0116683 A1 generates an AC electromagnetic flux with the flux lines flowing \"horizontally\" along the charging surfaces as shown in Fig.1a. A distributed winding is used in this charging platform for generating the AC flux. This princi- ple is in fact similar to the AC electromagnetic flux gen- erated in a cylindrical moter, except that the cylindrical structure is compressed into a flat pancake shape. As the flux needs to flow horizontally along the upper and lower surfaces, two inherent limitations arise. Firstly, an electromagnetic flux guide must be used to guide the flux along the bottom9. surface. This is usually a layer of soft magnetic material such as ferrite cr amorphous alloy. In order to provide sufficient flux, this layer must be \"thick\" enough so that the flux can pass along the layer of soft magnetic material without magnetic saturation. Second- ly, a similar problem applies to the secondary device that has to pick up flux (and energy) on the upper surface of the charging platform. Fig.1b shows the device required for the charging platform of Fig.1a. This consists of a magnetic core 104 and a winding 106. In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area 108 (shaded in Fig.1b). Therefore, this cross-sectional area inust be large enough so that enough", "type": "Document"}}
