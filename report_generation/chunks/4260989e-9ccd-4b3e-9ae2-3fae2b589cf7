According to implementations of the present invention, the surface techniques of plasma immersion ion implan- tation and deposition (PIII&D) and pressurized hydro- thermal treatment, and the methods of immobilizing an- timicrobial peptides onto the material surfaces are used to enhance the antimicrobial properties of a material sur- face. [0017] To reduce and potentially eliminate the techni- cal complications of existing antimicrobial techniques, the fabricating of the antimicrobial surface with the use of PIII&D, pressurized hydrothermal treatment, and an- timicrobial peptide coating as described in embodiments herein, provides an alternative to suppress the adhesion and proliferation of microorganisms. [0018] Embodiments of the present invention provide a controllable antimicrobial and biocompatible Ti alloy that can resist bacterial adhesion and proliferation with- out compromising its biocompatibility and original me- chanical properties. The controllable antimicrobial and biocompatible Ti alloy of embodiments of the present in- vention can resist microbial adhesion and proliferation by using surface techniques including PIII&D, intermedi- ate linker formation, and the immobilization of controlla- ble release antimicrobial peptides on the outmost sur- face. The medical applications of this special titanium alloy can include but are not limit to orthopaedic surger- ies, cardiovascular, and dental operations. [0019] For PIII&D, various sources including ions, electrons, free radicals, atoms and molecules can be im- planted onto the substrate surface as the basal surface to protect against microbial adhesion and growth. This basal surface is able to resist the attachment of microor- ganisms and the formation of biofilm. [0020] For the pressurized hydrothermal treatment, functional groups of", "type": "Document"}}
