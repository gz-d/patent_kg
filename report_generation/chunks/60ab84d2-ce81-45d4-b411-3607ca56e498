The barrier control compo- nent 110 can identify the type of visual content, based at least in part on the detected audio signal (e.g., the frequency of the specified audio signal).\n\nIn accordance with various aspects, there can be a signal contained or presented in the control region 112 for each visual image 104 of a piece of video content, for one visual image 104 of a plurality of visual images of a 3-D image or scene associated with video content, or only for specified visual images 104 of the video content. For example, a visual image 104 can comprise a signal to facilitate an initial selec- tion or a change in selection ofa display mode of the available multiple display modes, while the video content is being presented. As another example, a signal can be included in a specified number of visual images 104 of video content so that if, for any reason, the barrier control component 110 does not detect the signal in the control region 112 in relation to display of one visual image, the barrier control component 110 can detect the signal in one or more of the other visual images 104 that contain the signal as those visual images 104 are presented on the projector screen component 102. Addi- tionally or alternatively, the signal can be included in visual images 104 of a sequence of visual images periodically to facilitate periodic presentation of the signal in the control", "type": "Document"}}
