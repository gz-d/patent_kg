A sec- ondary energy receiving element may be added to the first energy receiving element. In particular, additional spiral windings can be added (connected in parallel) to the pick-up coil (i.e. the first winding that encloses the soft magnetic core) by printing one or more spiral windings 1200 on a printed circuit board (PCB) 1202 that is placed on top of a magnetic sheet 1204. The PCB is placed on the side of the magnetic sheet that in use would face the primary winding(s). It should also be noted that the PCB can be very thin (e.g., 0.2 mm) so the combination of the PCB and the magnetic sheet is stil very thin. By connecting (1214) terminal 1208 of the addi- tional winding to terminal 1206 of the first winding 1207, and connecting (1216) terminal 1212 of the additional winding to terminal 1210 of the first winding, as shown in FIG. 124, the two windings are connected in parallel. The extra planar winding(s) can improve the energy pick-up in the secondary", "type": "Document"}}
