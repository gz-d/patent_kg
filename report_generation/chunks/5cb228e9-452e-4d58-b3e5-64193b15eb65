In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, the method is performed in vivo. In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, the liquid is one or more of: blood, lymphatic fluid, etc. The sample may alternatively be a phantom, a dead object, etc.\n\n[0028] In one embodiment of the fifth aspect in which the liquid is blood, the one or more processors are arranged to process one of the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal based on a photoacoustic absorption model to determine hemoglobin concentration in the blood.\n\n[0029] In one embodiment of the fifth aspect, the one or more processors are further arranged to receive a third photoacoustic signal from a sample in response to transmis- sion of a third laser pulse to the sample, the third laser pulse has a third wavelength different from the first wavelength and the second wavelength; and process at least one of the first photoacoustic signal and the second photoacoustic signal, and the third photoacoustic signal, based on a linear spectral unmixing model to determine oxygen saturation in the blood. The determined oxygen saturation can be uncom- pensated oxygen saturation in the blood or compensated oxygen saturation in the blood.", "type": "Document"}}
