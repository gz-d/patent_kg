The ground plane 206 is generally a flat conductive surface with three slots. At the center of the ground plane 206, which, In plan view, correspond to the main patch 204A is a U-shaped slot, a A,/2 U-shaped slot 230 formed (e.g., etched) in the ground plane 206. Two generally-n shaped side slots 232 are arranged on two sides of the U- shaped slot 230 to improve the suppression level of the lower stopband.\n\nFigure 2C shows the filter element 214 at least partly arranged inside the substrate 202. In this embodiment, the filter element 214 1s a chip resistor embedded in the substrate 202 (a small hole formed in the substrate 202) for absorbing or dissipating stopband energy. The chip resistor has a resistance of 47Q. One end of the chip filter is soldered to the main patch 204A whereas the other end of the chip filter is soldered to the ground plane 206.\n\nThe filter-antenna 200 of Figures 2A to 2D includes a filter integrated into the patch antenna. The filter is formed by a defected microstrip structure arranged in the microstrip network 204, the chip resistor 214, and a defected ground structure arranged in the ground plane 206. The defected microstrip structure includes the stubs and slots 220 arranged in the central portion 204A1. The defected ground structure includes the slots 230, 232 formed ln the ground plane 206. The filter can be considered as a resistor-terminated band-stop filter (BSF) 210.\n\nFigure 3 shows\n\na\n\nmethod 300 for making a\n\nfilter-antenna in\n\none\n\nembodiment of the", "type": "Document"}}
