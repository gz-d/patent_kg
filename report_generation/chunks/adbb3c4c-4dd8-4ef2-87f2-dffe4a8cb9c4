The x-axis repre- sents the gene expression level after log 2 conversion of HEK293T cells in the treatment group. The y-axis represents the gene expression after log 2 conversion in wild-type HEK293T cells. The expression levels of XIST DANCR and MALAT1 are highlighted in red. Note that MALAT1 is abundant in HEAT293T cells, and the expression level of DANCR is much lower than XIST and MALAT1.\n\n[0088] FIG. 104 shows the location of the gRNA group of DANCR used in CARPID (upper: DANCR-L1/2; lower: MALATI-L1/L2) and gPCR primers (upper: DANCR: P1/P2; lower: MALAT1: P1/P2). F, forward primer; R, reverse strand primer. The number in parentheses indicates the position of the gRNA set starting from 1 nt in the corresponding RNA transcript.\n\n[0089] FIG. 10c shows that LacRNA DANCR combines proteomic identification with CARPID and then MS. The volcano map shows that in HEK293T cells expressing BASU-dCasRx, the enrichment of ncRNA DANCR-related proteins in each group of gRNA exceeds that of the control (empty gRNA expression vector). The x-axis represents the logarithmic change fold of the protein level in CARPID of each group of DANCR gRNA relative to the control. The y-axis shows the negative log 10 converted p-value after (non-parametric rank product test). Significantly enriched proteins are marked with orange dots.\n\n[0090] FIG. 10d shows the top six important gene ontol- ogy (GO) term of DANCR-related proteins.\n\n[0091] FIGS. 114 to 11d show verification of the presence of DANCR in exosomes, wherein:", "type": "Document"}}
