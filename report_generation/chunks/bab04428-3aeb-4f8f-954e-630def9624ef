[0088] Dual-pulse flowmetry in the above embodiment\n\napplicable\n\nwas used to measure blood flow speed in the mouse ear. FIGS. 4A to 4G show the related results. Specifically, FIG. 4A shows photoacoustic imaging or sensing of blood vessels in the mouse ear acquired with 532 nm wavelength; FIG. 4B shows flow speed image measured by dual-pulse flowmetry in the above embodiment. FIGS. 4C and 4D are flow speed rofiles along with the dashed line 410 in FIG. 4A measured y the existing photoacoustic Doppler method and the dual-pulse method.
