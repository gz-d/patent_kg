The patch may be arranged centrally of the substrate.\n\nFILTER-ANTENNA AND METHOD FOR MAKING THE SAME\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n[0001] The invention relates to a filter-antenna and method for making the filter-antenna. The invention also relates to a communication device that includes the filter- antenna.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Filters and antennas are common and important components in communication devices. A filter-antenna (or filtering-antenna) is a device that combines an antenna and filter.\n\n[0012] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the patch further includes a first side portion connected with and arranged a first side of the central portion and a second side portion connected with and arranged at a second, opposite side of the central portion. Each of the first and second side portions includes one or more stubs. In one example, each o the first and second side portions includes a dual-stub or a dual-stub feed. The stubs in the dual stub or dual stub feed can be of different lengths.", "type": "Document"}}
