The system comprises a microfluidic comprises a varying width configured to deform the cell to multiple deformation levels, an imaging device configured. to obtain image data of the cell received by the microfluidic channel and a processor in communication with the imaging device. The processor is configured to receive, from the imaging device, image data of the cell deformed within the microfluidic channel at a first deformation level and a second deformation level different from the first deformation level and to determine, based on the image data, one or more parameters associated with the deformed cell at the first deformation level and the second deformation level.\n\n112 Sy 114 as oa Ais Intake g x & * Ration 0 oF Pressure Redacing Regulater Caorpressed Ady Flaw Ind Cell\n\n108\n\nPatent Application Publication\n\nApr. 21, 2022 Sheet 1 of 16\n\nUS 2022/0120657 Al", "type": "Document"}}
