Immunofluorescence staining is applied on both intact cells and extracted nuclei. For staining nucleo- skeleton of the intact cells, they are first detached by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). Each population of ~10\u00b0 cells is transferred to a syringe tube for the following steps. The cell sample is centrifuged, followed by aspiration. The cells are then fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) for 15 minutes. Next, cells are washed with PBS. Triton X-100 is added to PBS for a volumetric ratio of 0.3% for 20 minutes to permeabilize the cells. The solution is blocked with 3% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hour to prevent the non-specific bindings in the following steps. The cells are then incubated in a primary antibody (Lamin A/C monoclonal antibody; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a dilution of 1:100 in 3% BSA for 1 hour, followed by washing the cells with the final cell culture media containing BSA. Cells are then incubated in a secondary antibody (Alexa-555; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) at a dilu- tion of 1:1500 in 3% BSA in the dark for 1 hour. After washing the cells twice, they are resuspended for a cell concentration of ~10\u00b0 cells/ml. The staining procedures for nucleoskeleton in the isolated nuclei are the same as for the\n\nintact cells.\n\nCell Viability Test\n\n[0135] The cell viability test of recollected cells and cells in the group is performed by using the LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit (Life Technologies). The prepared staining reagents are added into cell suspensions for 20 min to stain live/dead cells with different fluorescent signals.\n\nImage Capture and Processing", "type": "Document"}}
