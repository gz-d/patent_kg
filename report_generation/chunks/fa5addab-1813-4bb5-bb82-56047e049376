The first reference direction and the second reference direction are substantially orthogo- nal.\n\n[0027] FIG. 5 is a functional block diagram of an infor- mation handling system that can be used as at least part control unit in one embodiment of the invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION", "type": "Document"}}
