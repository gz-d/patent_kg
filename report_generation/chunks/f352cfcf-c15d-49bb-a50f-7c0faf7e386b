Optionally, the respective extents of spatial-temporal activ- ity distortion for each temporal frame of the synthesized video file are weighted to determine the overall extent of spatial-temporal activity distortion.\n\n[0090] an example flicker distortion along the rim of a pillar in the synthesized video with depth compression distortion of Undodancer. It can be observed that the intensity of point A in the original view (FIG. 2A) changes little and relatively smoothly in the twenty frames. In contrast, the intensity of corresponding point in synthesized view (FIG. 2B), ie., point A,,,, in the synthesized view, fluctuated drastically in temporal domain. This would appear unnatural to the viewers, potentially annoying them. Existing 2D and 3D view quality assessment (VQA) metrics have not well considered the properties of the synthesized virtual view videos and the flicker distortion. Therefore, there is a need for a more effective quality assessment method for application in synthesized videos.\n\n[0088] One specific implementation of the method of FIG. is presented below.
