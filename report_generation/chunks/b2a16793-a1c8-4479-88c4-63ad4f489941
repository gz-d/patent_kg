The data passing through the\n\nfilter 402 comes to the filter 403 which eliminates irrelevant reports. In the text report of the medical imaging examination, there are error reports, non-final reports, or other reports with insufficient information for data processing, and these data cannot pass the filter 403. In addition, because the patient may take multiple CT or MRI during the entire admission treatment period, it reflects the condition of the disease at different stages during the treatment process. For example, in element 109, the mortality of a patient is output after the first round of examinations after admission to the hospital. Therefore, a textual data that can represent a confirmed stroke or the first effective imaging examination after a stroke is selected to be used in the follow-up study. However, in element 111, since the aim is to predict the patient's treatment, one or more data are selected for use according to the patient's treatment stage. The third filter 404 is used to pre-process the selected text data. It can delete stop words that do not contribute to the meaning of the research report, and organize the format of the text\n\n15\n\nreport. The sample after three filters is called processed textual data 405.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n[0047]\n\nFIG. 5A is a schematic block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a data", "type": "Document"}}
