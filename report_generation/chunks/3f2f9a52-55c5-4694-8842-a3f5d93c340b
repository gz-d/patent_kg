Choi uses one planar winding 400 as a primary charging pad and a separate planar winding 402 as a secondary win ding as shown in Figs. 4a and 4b. Fig.5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit diagram 500 cf this contactless charging system. It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described by Hui and Tang, while the front power stage of the sec- ondary circuit is a standard winding with a diode rectifier that provides the rectified DC voltage for the charging circuit. Also related to the disclosure of Choi as discussed above is related patent application US 2002/0110013 which discloses the precharacterising portion of claim 1. [0008] Two main problems suffered by the prior art charging system of Fig.5 include:\n\n(1) The planar winding of the secondary module must be placed directly on top of the planar winding of the primary unit. If it is slightly misplaced, the energy transfer will be seriously hampered. (2) The use of one spiral planar winding in the sec- ondary module to pick up energy emitted from the primary winding requires the choice of switching fre- quency to be very high (eg 950 kHz). Such high switching frequency leads to high switching loss in the primary inverter circuit, high AC resistance in the PCB copper tracks and more importantly high elec- tromagnetic interference (EMI) emission.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25", "type": "Document"}}
