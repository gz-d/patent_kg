Mechanical properties of a cell nucleus, such as the elasticity and viscosity, are known to be important factors that affect cancer cells development and migration. Existing studies on cells have revealed that cancerous cells are usually more deformable comparing to benign cells, thereby promoting migration of cancerous cells to other parts of the body to establish new colonies. Hence, cell stiffness has been con- sidered an effective biomarker for certain cancers such as lung carcinoma and ovarian cancer.\n\n[0003] Accordingly, it is important to accurately quantify the mechanical properties of a cell nucleus to advance the understanding of the role of cell mechanics in the develop- ment of diseases. There are various existing methods that are used to quantify mechanical properties of a cell nucleus which involve either assessing an extracted nucleus or an unextracted nucleus (ie. a nucleus contained in a cell). However, mechanical properties of a cell nucleus are diffi- cult to be quantified accurately by existing methods due to some limitations associated with these methods.\n\n[0004] For example, some existing methods may involve process such as mechanical or chemical nuclear extraction that changes the mechanical properties of the nucleus, thereby compromising the reliability of the results obtained from the methods. Also, the results obtained from some of the existing methods may be highly dependent on variables such as the probing positions of the nucleus. Consequently, the mechanical properties quantification using these meth- ods may not be accurate.", "type": "Document"}}
