The\n\ncapability of CECE using new materials to fabricate the\n\n[ 0079 ]\n\nIn the manufacturing of various hierarchical struc\n\npre - designed hierarchical structures opens up a broad way to\n\ntures , the formation of cracks has normally been avoided due\n\nenable new functions of the bio - inspired materials .

For example , in one of the most\n\ninventors demonstrated two impressive examples in the\n\ncommonly used fabrication processes , replication , the inevi\n\ninventors ' work . One example is a 3D hierarchical struc\n\ntable formation of uncontrolled cracks and subsequent struc\n\ntured soft membrane mimicking the smart - skin patterns of\n\ntural failure , as a result of the presence of deadlocking\n\nspringtails that show outstanding repellence to various liq\n\nregion in the transfer of hierarchical structures .
