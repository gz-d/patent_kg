Toxicity Test\n\nTo determine the toxicity of a compound for a biological system, an observable and well-defined endpoint must be identified. Mortality is one of these widely used endpoints. The index of lethal effects describing the potency of a com- pound is called LC; , which is defined as the dosage of a chemical causing death in at least 50% of the animals tested. In addition to lethality, adverse effects such as malformation in morphology induced by a compound can be used as an observable endpoint. These adverse outcomes along with death are grouped as total adverse effects. The potency of a compound to induce adverse effects is defined as EC, which is the concentration ofa compound causing at least 50% of the animals tested to exhibit abnormal appearances as well as death.\n\ne.
