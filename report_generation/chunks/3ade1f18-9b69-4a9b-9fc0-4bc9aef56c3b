Some embodiments of the invention provide a universal metasurface that is a waveguide-fed spatiotempo- rally modulated metasurface capable of extracting and modulating guided waves into desired out-of-plane free- space waves. Some embodiments of the invention incorpo- rate positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes into each meta- atom of the metasurface or metasurface antenna to switch the element between the coupling (\u201c1\u201d) and non-coupling (\u201c0\u201d) states. In some embodiments, the coupling state of the meta-atoms can be dynamically controlled by a controller, e.g., a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), in a pre- designed time sequence. Some embodiments of the inven- tion provide a universal metasurface antenna can dynami- cally, simultaneously, independently, and/or precisely\n\n19\n\nAug. 1, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
