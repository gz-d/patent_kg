The surgical implant according to claim 12, wherein the reactive functional group includes an -OH group, wherein the linker molecule includes APTES, where- in the APTES attaches at one end to the -OH group on the plasma treated titanium surface, wherein an- other end of the APTES having a primary amine group links up with additional linkers and/or antimi- crobial peptides and the primary amine group at the another end of the APTES is converted into a second functional group by a series of chemical reactions.\n\n7. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the controllable release antimicrobial peptide coat- ing is effective against at least one of Staphylococ- cus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphyloco- ccus epidermidis, Salmonella Dublin, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Streptococcus mutans.\n\n8. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the antimicrobial peptides of the controllable release antimicrobial peptide coating include anionic pep- tides, cationic peptides, anionic and cationic pep- tides that contain cysteine and form disulfide bonds, or catioinic peptides enriched for specific amino acid attachment.\n\n9. The surgical implant according to claim 1, wherein the modified titanium alloy is capable of withstanding short-term and long-term deep tissue infection.\n\n10. The surgical implant according to claim 1, further comprising linker molecules between the plasma treated titanium alloy surface and the antimicrobial peptide coating, preferably comprising 3-aminopro- pyltriethoxysilane (APTES).\n\nPatentanspr\u00fcche\n\n35\n\n1.
