Such mechanical effect has been observed in spinal surgery, where the force required to hold tissue in tension decreases gradually during the operation. The correction force applied by the correction system will also decrease as the tissues relax. The loosening of the cor- rection systems can cause a partial recurrence of de- formity subsequent to the correction. Consequently, con- ventional correction systems can cause a loss of correc- tion for up to 15% due to the recurrence of deformity. Thus, viscoelastic behavior of spinal tissues can limit the amount of correction force and in turn the correction rate. If excessive correction forces are used, they can cause bony fractures. In addition, neurological deficit can occur due to rapid over-stretching of the spinal cord. [0009] Gradual and constant correction forces have been adopted to overcome the deficiency caused by vis- coelastic relaxation of spinal tissues. Such correction forces can take up the loss of correction occurred due to the viscoelastic behaviors of biological tissues and effect a gradual correction of the deformity subsequent to sur- gery. Conventional systems providing gradual or con- stant correction forces nevertheless require some form of repeated surgery or post-operative care, resulting in", "type": "Document"}}
