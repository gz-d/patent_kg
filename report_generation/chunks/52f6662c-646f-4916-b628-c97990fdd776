The steps of method to train the ML model ML3 are fully described as follows.\n\nFIG. 12A depicts a step flow chart of a training method for training the second ML model ML2 according to an embodi- ment of the present invention. FIG. 12B depicts a step flow chart of a step $410 of the training method for training the second ML model ML2 according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 13 depicts a pipeline diagram in the FIG, 12A.\n\nReferring to FIG. 11, in the step S310: A negative event and a positive event are defined. In detail, the negative event may include, for example, two different situations, such as a separate event of the thumb finger and the index finger and a staying-still event of the thumb finger and the index finger. The separate event of the thumb finger and the index finger represents that the thumb finger is not in contact with the index finger. The staying-still event of the thumb finger and the index finger represents that thumb finger is in contact with the index finger but staying still. On the other hand, the positive event may include, for example, one or more known microgestures (a) to (j) as shown in the FIG. 6.\n\nIn the step $320: One or more negative training data sets is measured by, the receiving electrode portions RP, in response to the negative event during a negative event caused by the two fingers.\n\nIn the step S330: One or more positive training data sets is measured by, the receiving electrode portions RP, in response to the positive event during a positive event caused by the two fingers.", "type": "Document"}}
