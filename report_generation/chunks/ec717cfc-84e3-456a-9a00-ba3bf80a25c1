The input resistance of the antenna loo controlled by varying the width L, of strip 112A.\n\nwith opposite ends that are close but spaced apart. The loop-like portion includes two generally parallel long sides and two generally parallel short sides. The short sides are generally perpendicular to the long sides. One of the long sides is formed by two elongated conductive strip portions 108A1, 108A2 each connected with a respective half of the planar dipole antenna 106. The elongated conductive strip portions 108A1, 108A2 are generally rectangular (or straight), each being generally perpendicular to the respec- tive second elongated conductive strip portion 106B, 106D. The other long side is formed by an elongated conductive strip portion 108D that is generally rectangular. The short sides are formed by elongated conductive strip portions 108B, 108C that connect the two long sides at respective ends. The elongated conductive strip portions 108B, 108C are generally rectangular. A generally rectangular conduc- tive patch portion 108E is continuous with the elongated conductive strip portion 108D and is arranged within a space defined by the long sides and the short sides. The elongated conductive strip portion 108D is arranged to connect the two short elongated conductive strip portions 108B, 108C such that they are electrically-shorted. The generally rectangular conductive patch portion 108E is arranged to form the ground of the feed network on the opposite (top) side 102 on", "type": "Document"}}
