The polarization states of the two radiated beams can be controlled by applying different space-time coding sequences to the +45\u00b0-inclined slot openings in each sub- metasurface.\n\n[0188]\n\nFIG. 37 shows an example synthesis process of the\n\nSTC film to support dual-channel SDM-FDM-PDM data transmission links. In this example, the bit stream for each sub-metasurface is mapped to the corresponding STC film according to the desired conversion harmonic frequency, polarization, and signal modulation format. The final STC film for dual-channel multiplexing is the sum of the two STC films for the two interwoven sub-metasurfaces. Following the same shared aperture technology, the radiation directions of CH1 and CH2 are further manipulated to (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0) and (30\u00b0 and \u201430\u00b0) respectively. This can be achieved by chang- ing the applied time gradients to the two sub-metasurfaces to vary the momentum property of the extracted propagating waves. The measured radiation patterns (FIGS. 38 and 39) and the measured decoded constellation diagrams of the two channels at the receiver end (right inset of FIGS. 38 and 39) have verified the SDM-FDM-PDM data transmission links. Based on the above, it can be seen that the shared aperture technique can combine the functionalities of multiple sub- metasurfaces into one aperture, thereby expanding the wave and information manipulation capabilities of the universal\n\nmetasurface antenna 400.\n\nInherent Directional Modulation\n\n[0189] The direction-dependent phase property at the fun- damental frequency can be elucidated from the perspective of spatial Fourier transform. The aperture field distribution of the metasurface and its spatial frequency spectrum (far- field radiation pattern in free space) F(9) fulfills the Fourier transform relationship", "type": "Document"}}
