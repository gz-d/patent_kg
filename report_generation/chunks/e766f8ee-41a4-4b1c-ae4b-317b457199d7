The second layer of the prediction model of the machine learning and deep learning models 113 is an ensemble model, which uses the input data to the machine learning and deep learning models 113 and results from the first layer as its input, then generates and outputs the probability of mortality 117. The output result may have different timescale of the mortality prediction such as with 30-day, 6-month, or\n\nlonger.\n\n30\n\n[0038] The ICD-9 prediction module 106 is configured to predict the specific subtype of strokes for stroke patients from input received from data collection module 104.
