The method includes, in step 102, processing a reference video file and a synthesized video file to compare the reference video file and the synthesized video file. Here the synthesized video file is associated with the reference video file. Then, in step 104A, an extent of flicker distortion of the processed video file is determined based on the processing. Additionally or alter- natively, in step 104B, an extent of spatial-temporal activity distortion of the synthesized video file is determined based. on the processing. Finally, in step 106, a quality of the synthesized video file is determined based on one or both of the extent of flicker distortion of the processed video file and the extent of spatial-temporal activity distortion of the synthesized video file. In this embodiment, the synthesized video file is a 3D video file containing 3D video data, or a virtual video file virtual video data.\n\n[0064] FIG. 11F is an edge map of the depth map of F with canny threshold 0.2;\n\n[0065] FIG. 11G is an edge map of the depth map of 11B with canny threshold 0.3; 4\n\n[0066] FIG. 11H is an edge map of the depth map of 11B with canny threshold 0.4; \u53ef\n\n[0067] FIG. 111 is an edge map of the depth map of with canny threshold 0.5; \u53ef\n\n[0068] FIG. 12A is a video frame of a synthesized entitled \u201cUndodancer\u201d;\n\n[0069] FIG. 12B is a depth map of the video frame of 12A; \u53ef\n\n[0070] FIG. 12C is an edge map of the depth map of F 12B with canny threshold 0.03;\n\n[0071] FIG. 12D is an edge map of the depth map of with canny threshold 0.07; \u53ef", "type": "Document"}}
