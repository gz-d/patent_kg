[0046] Fig. 3 shows a third embodiment of the correc- tion device 1, which is of a dual support member type. The correction device 1 can comprise first and second support members 10a and 10b, such as in the form of \"C\" or \"S\" shaped supporting rods 12a and 12b. The sup- port members 10a and 10b can be disposed in various positions in relation to the deformed spine 2. In one ex- emplary embodiment, at least one of the support mem- bers 10a and 10b can be longitudinally aligned on the posterior side of the spine 2. In another exemplary em- bodiment, the first and second support members 10a and 10b can fit into the concave and convex sides of the de- formed spine portion 4, respectively. If desired, one or more cross-linking elements 40 can be provided to con- nect between the support members 10a and 10b, such as shown in Fig. 3. [0047] The support members 10a and 10b can be se- cured to the deformed spine 2 in various manners. In one exemplary embodiment, the support members 10a and 10b can extend from a proximal vertebra 6 to a distal vertebra 8 of the spine 2 and be secured thereonto. For example, the ends 16a and 18a, or 16b and 18b, of the support member 10a or 10b can be fixed to the proximal and distal vertebrae 6 and 8 by various securing elements 20, such as hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In one exemplary embodiment (not shown), the upper ends 16a and 16b of the support members 10a and 10b can be secured onto different proximal vertebrae. In an- other exemplary embodiment, each support member 10a or 10b can be secured to multiple sections of the de- formed spine 2. [0048] In one exemplary embodiment, at least one of the support members 10a and 10b can be formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic, or materials with similar properties. In an exemplary embodiment, both support members 10a and 10b can be made of a superelastic material. The superelastic", "type": "Document"}}
