An electrochemical detector comprising:\n\nsolution chamber and a substance selection structure separating the chamber into individual compartments, the solution chamber is arranged to retain and separate solutions in each of the individual compartments;\n\npair of electrodes each connecting the respective indi- vidual compartment, wherein the pair of electrodes arranged to form a conductive path across the elec- trodes when in contact with the solutions retained in the solution chamber;\n\n[0082] In addition, the electrochemical detector of the present invention is highly sensitivity and selective to the target substance. As shown in FIG. 7B, the electrochemical detector 100 only showed a decrease in the measured current with respect to the increasing concentration of the target antigen (CA72-4 in this example). In sharp contrast, the measured current of the detector remained substantially unchanged toward different concentrations of CA72-4 con-\n\nthe substance selection structure is arranged interact with a target substance in the solution so as alter an electrical characteristic of the conductive defined by the pair of electrodes, the solution retained\n\n[0084] Advantageously, the performance of the detection shows that the electrochemical detector has high selectivity and sensitivity for cancer biomarkers with the oligo-RNA aptamer modified membrane. In an exemplary embodiment illustrating the detection of an antigen of gastric cancer, it has been shown that the electrochemical detector containing such membrane may have a detection limit of 4 UmL7! and sensitivity of 0.384895 HAU-L mLem\u2122? toward the antigen. for\n\nor\n\nother\n\npro-\n\nteins\n\non\n\na\n\nand\n\na\n\nis\n\nwherein\n\nto\n\nto path\n\nMay 6 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0131995 A1\n\n6\n\nin the individual compartments in the solution chamber\n\n12.
