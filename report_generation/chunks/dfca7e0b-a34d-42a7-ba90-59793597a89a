The first and simplest way is to excite a coil with an AC power source as shown in Fig.6A. A sec- ond method is to use a multi-layer winding matrix struc- ture as shown in Fig.6B similar to that described in GB2389720A. However, in both cases, it has been point- ed out (Liu, X.; Chan, P.W.; Hui, S.Y.R.;, \"Finite element simulation of a universal contactless battery charging platform\", IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference 2005. APEC 2005. Volume 3, 6-10 March 2005 Page(s):1927-1932) that a central voltage sag phenom- enon exists. In practice, a secondary module (or energy receiving element) is used to pick up the energy for charg- ing the load. Fig.7 shows that in one practical experimen- tal setup, the rectified DC voltage picked up by a sec- ondary module on the planar surface is not entirely uni- form over the planar surface and in particular is reduced in the central part of the planar surface. This is known as central voltage sag phenomenon. This voltage sag in- creases as the surface area of the charging surface in- creases. [0013] Also known", "type": "Document"}}
