FIG. 15(a) shows the three defined coordinate systems and their geometric relationships for focus azimuthal steering by synchronous co-rotation of the metalens doublet. Increasing the sum of the rotation angles (or 1p) of the metalens pair while keeping their difference (or a) constant, the focal point will steer anticlockwise with the same radius. FIG. 15(c), (d) illustrate the orientations of the metalens doublet and their corre- sponding simulated power densities on the focal plane with the same o=45\u00b0 but with different p (@p=90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0 and 270\u00b0, respectively).

In addition, the focus at different azimuth angles shares a similar focus- ing performance in terms of near-field SLL, FWHM and power density. This is attributed to the isotropic character- istic of the employed dielectric pixel of the metalenses. Again, although only five azimuthal steering cases are presented in FIG. 15(d), the metalens doublet can realize continuous focus azimuthal steering with continuous syn- chronous co-rotation of the metalens pair.", "type": "Document"}}
