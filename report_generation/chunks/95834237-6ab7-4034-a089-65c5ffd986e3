As a result, C, and C, stay in an open-circuit and there is no charge flow between them.\n\n[0056] FIG. 146 shows that, In contrast, with the connec- tion of the drain electrode and PTFE rendered by the gating iquid (switching-on mode), the other capacitor C, is estab- ished at the water/drain interface, forming a closed-circuit together with C, and C,.\n\n[0063] The present invention relates two aspects com- bined together. A first aspect is concerned with the building block of modern electronics, field effect transistor, consist- ing of four major components, i.e., the gate, source, drain and substrate, respectively, which can dynamically gate the transport of carriers between the source and the drain when an external voltage is applied in gate. Please see FIG. 1a. FIG. 16 shows the schematic drawing of our transistor-like electricity generator, termed as TIDE-G, in which the source is made of a transparent ITO and the drain consists of an Al electrode.\n\n[0057] FIG. 15 is a graph showing output voltages as a function of droplet salt concentrations. The measured maxi- mum voltage up to ~170 V appears when the ion concen- tration is increased to 10-? mol/L, beyond which the output voltage decays, probably due to the inability to form the EDL again at such high concentration.", "type": "Document"}}
