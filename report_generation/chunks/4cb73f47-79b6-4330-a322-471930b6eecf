Values of f,,* between those boundaries are given a quantized value z,, of -2 and an inverse quantized value of -2 Ap f,* shown in the diagram is in a sub-zone having boundaries 238 and 242 and a quantization point 240. Therefore f,,* is given a quantized value of 1 and an inverse quantized value of A,,.\n\nExample quantization sub zone boundaries and corre- sponding inverse quantized values are shown in FIG. 5. It will be appreciated that the value of the inverse quantized value depends on the (ij) position of the coefficient as Ay varies depending on the ij position. This is a consequence of the scaling factors which vary for different regions in the block and are defined by the integer image transform and encoding standard used. The values of A,, for different position regions for an ICT transform is given in FIG. 3.\n\nwhere A,-A/q,,A,, is a quantization parameter and repre- sents the scaled quantization step for ICT-transformed coef- ficients f,,* of F*. The quantization steps are not equal for all coefficients of F* and the values of A,, depend on both A and the coefficients qy of Qy,,.,. The values of A,, differ for differ- ent positions as shown in FIG. 3. In addition, the inverse quantization of the ICT-transformed coefficients is defined as:", "type": "Document"}}
