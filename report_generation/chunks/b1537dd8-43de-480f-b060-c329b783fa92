The phantom is anticoagulated bovine blood filled in transparent rubber tube (0.25 mm inner diameter, TYGON S-54-HL, Norton Performance Plastics, NJ). The blood flow speed is set by a syringe pump. The photoacoustic probe and the blood sample are immersed in a water tank for acoustic coupling. The laser repetition rate is 4 kHz. The pulse energy on the sample surface is 100 nJ for each wavelength. The exponential decay model is fitted with the least square criteria. The exponential decay constants at different set flow speeds are plotted in FIG. 3A. As expected, the decay constant is a linear function of the flow speed with a determination coefficient (R*) of 0.952, indicating the high dependence of the increased photoacoustic amplitude on the flow speed. A, Tu and b are fitted as 0.11+0.01 (SD), 10.19+0.85 (SD) and 0.30+0.04 (SD). With the fitted coef- ficients, the flow speed can be determined from two pho- toacoustic signals. Using the same experimental setup, the flow speed measurement was validated in blood phantom. As shown in FIG. 3B, the measured flow speed is averaged. by 100 times and compared with the set flow speed. The measured flow speed is proportional to the set flow speed, that the is for\n\nshowing dual-pulse approach measuring the blood flow speed.
