Generally, NPC43 cells have a larger nuclear diameter (unextracted: 11.18+SD 1.62 jum, N=40; chemically extracted: 11.274SD 1.75 tum, N=40) comparing to those of NP460 cells (unextracted: 9.86+SD 55 yum, N=40; chemically extracted: 10.18+SD 1.29 um, N=40) as summarised in the bar graph of FIG. 4B. Based on these measured whole cell and nuclear sizes, it is configured that the suitable dimensions of the microfluidic channels are W,,=30 um, Wo Wn, Lo 300 hm and 6=2.5\u00b0. Additionally, the suitable channel height is 50 hm to avoid unwanted physical contacts of the captured cells/nuclei with\n\nthe roof and floor of the microfluidic channel.\n\nQuantification of Nuclear Elasticity\n\n[0091] FIG.
