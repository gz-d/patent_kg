In an exemplary embodiment, a constant or substantially constant and controllable force can be applied to the deformed spine portion with post-operation manipula- tion. In another exemplary embodiment, a constant or sub- stantially constant and controllable force can be applied to the deformed spine portion post-operatively without the need for further manipulation. It will be appreciated that other embodiments for correcting spinal deformities are also within the of the invention.\n\nFIGS. 5a and 56 show a fifth embodiment of the correction device, in which a braking element is provided in a single and a dual rod system, respectively.\n\nFIGS. 6a and 6b show a sixth embodiment of the correction device, in which a locking element is provided in a single and a dual rod system, respectively.\n\nFIGS. 7a and 76 show a seventh embodiment of the cor- rection device, where a blocking element is provided in a single rod system and a dual rod system, respectively.\n\ntion\n\nThe present invention provides a device for and a method\n\ndeformities.\n\nto\n\na\n\nin\n\nrod\n\nsystem\n\nrod\n\nsystem\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nso\n\nscope present Various methods can be used to form superelastic or pseu-\n\nmaterial.\n\nscope\n\npresent\n\nUS 7,976,568 B2\n\n6\n\n5\n\nprise a Superelastic or pseudoelastic material capable of pro\n\nVarious spinal deformities can be corrected in accordance\n\nviding a constant or Substantially constant correction force.\n\nwith the present invention.
