The unlocked anchor mem- bers 30 can later join the support member 10 to the deformed. spine portion 4 by various means after the operation.\n\nfully correcting spinal deformities. In an exemplary embodi- ment, the support member 10 can be formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material, or other materials with similar properties. One portion 14 of the superelastic support mem- ber 10 can be subjected to a deformation force and bent to conform to the deformed spine portion 4. The anchor member 30 can be applied to join the bent portion 14 of the support member 10 and the deformed spine portion 4, such as shown in FIG. 16. The correction of spine deformities can be achieved by straightening the bent portion 14 in a coronal or sagittal plane. In one exemplary embodiment, the support member 10 is capable of returning to its initial shape and providing a constant or substantially constant correction force in the return process. Additionally or alternatively, a transverse traction member 32 can be provided, which is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant transverse traction force for correcting spine deformities as", "type": "Document"}}
