In turn, these monitor systems itself are becoming more complex and expensive which as systems become more and more complex, they are in turn more prone to failure. This has adversely affecting the efficient of such systems perform its core functions in the first place.\n\n[0021] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the device wind turbine.\n\n[0022] In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for monitoring a device comprising:\n\n[0023] a device conditions gateway arranged to obtain operation information from a device, wherein the operation information is associated with the condition of the device in operation; and\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0024] a conditions monitoring engine arranged to pro- cess the operation information with a device modelling engine to determine one or more operation conditions of the device.\n\n[0004] In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for monitoring device comprising the steps of:\n\n[0025] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the device modelling engine includes a plurality of matching networks for processing the operation information of a plurality of devices.\n\n[0005] obtaining operation information from a device, wherein the operation information is associated with the condition of the device in operation; and\n\n[0006] processing the operation information with a device modelling engine to determine one or more operation conditions of the device.", "type": "Document"}}
