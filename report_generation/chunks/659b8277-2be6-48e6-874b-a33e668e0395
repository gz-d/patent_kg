In this embodiment, the AC short termination arrangement includes a grounded capaci- tor electrically connected in series with the transmission line arrangement. In this embodiment, the transmission line arrangement includes two straight transmission line portions arranged generally perpendicularly, a first one with an end electrically connected in series with the AC short termina- tion arrangement, and a second one extending from the first and electrically coupled with the patch antenna arrangement for capacitively feeding the patch antenna arrangement. A DC supply voltage may be applied at a node between the first transmission line portion and the AC short termination arrangement.\n\n[0156] In this embodiment, the transmission line arrange- ment and the AC short termination arrangement connected to the drain terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) are generally the same as the transmission line arrangement and the AC short termination arrangement connected to the drain terminal of the other one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A).\n\n[0157] Like the two transistors of the transistor arrange- ment 402A, the two transistors of the transistor arrangement 402B are also connected with various circuit arrangements.
