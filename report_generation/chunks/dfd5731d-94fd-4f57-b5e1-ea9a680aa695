Point-wise multiply polynomial vectors. Point-wise add polynomial vectors. Point-wise subtract polynomial vectors. Power of two rounding. Decompose to get high-order bits. Decompose to get low-order bits. Compute hint for overflow bits. Use hint to correct overflow bits.

For example, an ARM Cortex A9 CPU at 666 MHz may be used as a software processor, which is operable to execute Dilithium reference C code implementation in NIST Secu- rity Level 3 and with the TCF profiler. The inventors analyzed the schedule and data dependency of the algorithm, conduct profiling, and identify the time-consuming func- tions in the system, and the result is shown in the following table.\n\nNo. Operation Type Time Percentage (%) 1 SHA-3 45.7 2 INIT 22 3 NIT 11.6 4 PWM 9.68 5 PWA 3.94 6 Sampling 1.99 7 Others 5.09", "type": "Document"}}
