The framework mainly consists of five main steps/modules: temporal layer conversion, gradient feature ex traction, flicker distortion detection, sparse rep- resentation for flicker distortion features, and weighted layer pooling.\n\n[0095] FIG. 3 demonstrates the flowchart of the flicker distortion assessment. As shown in FIG. 3, first, an original video and the distorted synthesized video are converted to the temporal layers via temporal layer conversion (subsec-\n\na\n\n3D\n\n{Lai},\n\nFeb. 11 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0044791 A1\n\n6\n\ncorresponding to depth discontinuities , e.g. , strong edges or\n\n[ 0099 ] FIGS . 5A to 5E show a video frame synthesized\n\nwith original video and depth video , a temporal layer\n\nborders ( marked as rectangles ) .
