The osteoblasts were isolated from calvarial bones of 2-day-old mice that ubiqui- tously express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used to culture in a Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biowest, France), antibiotics (100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 Pg/ml of streptomycin), and 2mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The specimens (1 mm thick and 5 mm in diameter) were fixed onto the bottom of a 24-well tissue culture plate (Falcon) using 1% (w/v) agarose. A cell suspension of 5,000 cells was seeded onto the surface of the untreated NiTi samples and the three types of plasma-implanted samples (oxygen, nitrogen, and acetylene). Cells were grown in one ml of medium and changed every two days. Cell attachment and proliferation were examined after the second day of culture. After culturing for two days, the cells started to attach to and proliferate on all the samples. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that there is no immediate cytotoxic effect on all of the surface treated samples. [0016] It should be apparent to a person of ordinary skill that the improved alloys obtainable with the present invention can be used for a wide variety of applications, both as biomaterials and for other applications where such alloys might prove advantageous. For example, the alloys may be used to fashion orthopedic implants including replacement joints such as hips, knees, shoulders, elbows, fingers, or for rods, screws, nails, spinal implants and the like used for orthopedic purposes. They may also be used to form thin matches useful for making patches, tubing, and devices useful in urologic, cardiac, spinal, cerebrospinal, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, vascular, or esophageal surgery.\n\n5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45", "type": "Document"}}
