No. 6,765,425 for mains voltage and main frequency\n\ncan synchronously rectify a received signal (e.g., power sig\n\noperation, complicated timing circuits are needed to check\n\nthe switching times for the MOSFETs in order to differentiate\n\nnal) in accordance with various embodiments and aspects. In\n\n50\n\nan aspect, the system 100 can comprise components and\n\ndifferent types of loads. It is desirable to be able to provide a\n\nassociated circuitry that form a synchronous rectifier (e.g.,\n\nself-driven AC-DC synchronous rectification technique that\n\ncan be used to develop an AC-DC synchronous rectifier that\n\nself-drive synchronous rectifier (also referred to herein as\n\ncan behave like a diode bridge and be used in high-voltage\n\nSDSR)), which includes self-driven control circuitry that can\n\nbe employed in high-voltage power applications while pro\n\npower applications, but with significantly reduced conduc\n\n55\n\ntion losses and without requiring control integrated circuits.
