Fig.5(b) shows the measured flux distribution of one planar transformer when the windings in the transformer array are connected in series. This measurement confirms the uniform magnetic flux distribution of the array structure. Comparison of Fig.1(b) and Fig.5(b) confirms the improvement of the uniform magnetic field distribution the transformer structure.
