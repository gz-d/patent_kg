The coil undergone 180\u00b0 bending deforma- tions in two directions before initiating plastic deformation. The PLGA with the thickness of 20 um and the Mg coil with the thickness of 40 hm were modeled by shell elements (S4R). The minimal element size was set as 30 jum, one-fifth of the width of the Mg coil (150 ym), to ensure the accuracy of the simulation. The mechanical parameters in the analysis were Ex,.=45 Gpa, Vag\u20140.35, Epp gy=l6 Mpa, Vpzc470.5.\n\nExample 4\u2014Experimental Setup for the Wireless Stimulator\n\n[0168] Monophasic electrical impulses (duration: 100~200 hs; voltage: 100~500 mV pp) generated by a wave- form generator (KEITHLEY, 3390, 50 MHz) were amplified with an amplifier (2100 L). The resulting output was deliv- ered to primary coils consisting of four-turn wires in a 6 cm-diameter loop. The receiver Mg coils had 21 turns of two layers (42-turn coil) in a 15-mm square connected to a radio frequency diode and Mg/PLGA/Mg capacitor (10~50 pF). The received radio frequency power was transformed to a direct current output by this circuit.\n\nExample 5\u2014Cytotoxicity Tests\n\n[0169] The cytotoxicity tests of NIH 3T3 cells cultured in PLGA microneedle soaking solution were evaluated by the LIVE/DEAD Kit (Molecular Probes, USA) and amalarBlue reagent (Invitrogen, USA). NIH 3T3 cells were first cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin(100\n\nUS 2024/0024646 Al\n\nU/mL), and fetal bovine serum (10%) (FBS, Gibco) in an", "type": "Document"}}
