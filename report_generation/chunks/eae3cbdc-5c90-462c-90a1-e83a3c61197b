The electrolyte, particularly a hydrogel electrolyte comprising a polymer matrix may be prepared by forming a mixture of a first gel monomer, an initiator, a first crosslinking agent, a second crosslinking agent, and a first coupling agent. In this example, the polymer matrix is a matrix of PAAm and alginate. The first gel monomer is acrylamide, the initiator is ammonium persulfate, the first crosslinking agent is N,N'-methylenebi- sacrylamide (MBAA), the second crosslinking agent is ethylene glycol (EG), and the first coupling agent is 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrlate (TMSPMA).\n\n[0199] Turning back to the step of encapsulating the anode and the cathode with the electrolyte. The anode and the cathode may be encapsulated by the electrolyte separately by immersing the anode or the cathode into the blend as mentioned above, followed by the step of curing the blend at room temperature or a higher temperature and soaking the cured blend in an aqueous electrolytic solution. As such, each of the anode and the cathode would be encapsulated by an electrolyte, forming an encapsulated anode and an encap- sulated cathode.\n\n[0192] Preferably, the mixture is formed by dissolving 3 g of acrylamide monomer (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) into 20 mL 30% EG solution. The solution is then added with 14.3 mg of ammonium persulphate (APS, >98%, Acros Organics) and 0.16 mL of 0.1 mol L-' MBAA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich). After that, 76 wl of TMSPMA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich 440159) is added to the mixture under vigorously stirring. The mixture may then be added with an alginate (i.e.", "type": "Document"}}
