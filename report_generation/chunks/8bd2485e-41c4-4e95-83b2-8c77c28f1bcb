Experimental Results and Analyses\n\n[0119] Experiments and simulations have been performed to assess the performance of the method of the above embodiments. This section first presents the Canny thresh- old determination for edge detection. Then, the quality assessment performance is compared among the proposed SR-3DVQA test is conducted subsequently. Finally, the impacts of the pooling method and the reference depth video are evaluated.\n\nA. Canny Threshold Determination\n\n[0120] It is important to choose a suitable Canny threshold depth edge detection for flicker area detection. In this example, the edge detection effects among different canny thresholds are compared.\n\n[0124] 2) Dataset and Settings for SR-3DVQA Prediction: The SIAT synthesized video database of X. Liu, Y. Zhang, S. Hu, S. Kwong, C. C. J. Kuo and Q. Peng, \u201cSubjective and objective video quality assessment of 3D synthesized views with texture/depth compression distortion,\u201d IEEE Trans. Image Process., vol. 24, no. 12, pp. 4847-4861, December 2015 was adopted as the testing dataset. This testing dataset is totally different from the learning dataset. This testing dataset consists of 10 MVD sequences and 140 synthesized videos in 1024x768 and 1920x1088 resolution which were obtained by 14 different combinations of compressed tex- ture/depth videos, namely generated with different quanti- zation parameters. Each video was synthesized by two views composed of two texture videos and their corresponding depth videos. Depending on whether the texture/depth video", "type": "Document"}}
