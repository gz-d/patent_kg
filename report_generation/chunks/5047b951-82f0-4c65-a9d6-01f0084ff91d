An example of an individual dielectric projection is shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 2 shows a post in the shape of a parallelepiped. aving a height h and a side length/lattice size P. In one embodiment, P=0.25 mm (0.254, where 80 ,, is the free- space wavelength at 300 GHz). A full transmission phase range over 360\u00b0 can be achieved as h is varied from 0.1 to 1.6 mm Note that the dimensions change for different selected wavelengths that are emitted by feed horn 3. The eight of the dielectric post h for each element is different from pixel to pixel to compensate for the required transmis- sion phase for the two DDLs. In one example, the diameter of DDL 1 is 15 mm and the distance between the phase center of the feed horn 3 and DDL 1 is set to approximately 24 mm to provide a proper illumination taper on the aperture of the lens. The height distribution of the dielectric posts for DDL 1 is shown in FIG. 4(a). The dielectric projections may include multiple subarrays, each of the sub-arrays including multiple dielectric projections of generally decreasing\n\nlengths.", "type": "Document"}}
