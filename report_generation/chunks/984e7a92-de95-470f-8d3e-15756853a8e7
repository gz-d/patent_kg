For example, the slots of the subwavelength units of the meta- surface structure 202 may be formed (e.g., etched) in or on the electrically conductive layer. In some embodiments, each subwavelength unit of the metasurface structure 202 is respectively operably coupled with two or more of the electrically conductive elements (e.g., each slot operably coupled with at least one of the electrically conductive elements). The another electrically conductive layer may include a biasing circuit with multiple biasing circuit por- tions each respectively operably coupled with a respective subwavelength unit of the metasurface structure 202. The biasing circuit portion may bias the semiconductor elements of the same control arrangement in the corresponding sub-\n\nAug. 1, 2024\n\nwavelength unit in the same bias state. In some embodi- ments, the semiconductor elements of the control arrange- ments of the subwavelength units of the metasurface structure 202 are arranged to be controlled by the controller 20 to respectively selectively operate in ON state and OFF state, to respectively operate each respective subwavelength unit of the metasurface structure 202.\n\n[0123] FIG. 3 shows a controller 300 in some embodi- ments of the invention.
