The device conditions gateway 104 is arranged to obtain opera- tion information for one or more devices 102 whilst the conditions monitoring engine 106 is arranged to process this operation information for the one or more devices 102 so as to determine one or more operation conditions for the device or devices 102. These operation conditions in turn can be used for further processing or user review so as to determine the status and condition of the device itself to diagnose, predict or solve problems for the device 108. Preferably, the conditions monitoring engine 106 includes a device model- ling engine 204 which is arranged to process the operation information by use of a generated model associated with the device 102 being monitored so as to devise one or more operations of the device 102.\n\n[0037] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the one or more hidden layers inserted by adding one or more hidden nodes into the hidden layers.\n\n[0038] In an embodiment of the second aspect, weights biases of the deep neural network are manipulated when neural network is adjusted.\n\n[0039] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the device is a wind turbine.\n\n[0040] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the system further comprises a pre-processor arranged to process the operation information obtained from the device conditions gateway.\n\n[0041] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the opera- tion information is pre-processed before the information is inputted to the device modelling engine.\n\n[0042] In an embodiment of the second aspect, the opera- information is pre-processed to remove fault data from operation information.", "type": "Document"}}
