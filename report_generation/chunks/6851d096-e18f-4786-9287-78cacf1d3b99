Haloperidol is a butyropherone derivative with antipsychotic properties. Car- diac arrhythmia has been related to the oral use of haloperi- dol (Henderson et al. 1991) and the mechanism of haloperi- dol-induced arrhythmia involved the blockage of hERG channel (Suessbrich et al. 1997).\n\nanalyzing the video with image analysis software which moving blood cells within each video frame are detected and quantified, in order to obtain a series of data points from each video frame from either a part of the video or the whole of the video;\n\nplying power spectral analysis to analyze the series of data points, in order to obtain a cardiac rhythmicity index; 2 2", "type": "Document"}}
