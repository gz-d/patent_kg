The method comprises locating a sample on a sample holder in an implantation chamber, supplying gaseous or vaporized implantation material to the implantation chamber through a feed conduit, the feed conduit having an end that opens into the implantation chamber and above the sample holder to form a feed conduit exit opening, the end and the feed conduit exit opening formed by the end defining a feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, and the sample holder defining a sample holder cross-sectional area situated opposite from the feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, the feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area being smaller than said sample holder cross-sectional area. The method further comprises applying a negative potential to the sample holder while maintaining the end at a potential that is positive relative to the sample holder so as to generate an electron focused electric field between the sample holder and the feed conduit exit opening that is effective to generate a glow discharge to create a plasma from the gaseous or vapor- ized implantation material, whereby ions from the plasma are\n\nPRIOR ART", "type": "Document"}}
