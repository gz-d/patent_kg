By applying the novel method to scene perception, the explorative and focused strategies among Asians were detected. Whereas the explorative strategy was associated with better foreground object recognition performance, the focused strategy was associated with better feature integration and planning abilities. Also, images with a salient foreground object relative to the background induced larger individual differences In eye movement patterns. These results have important clinical and educational implications for the use of eye tracking in cognitive deficit detection and cognitive performance monitoring.
