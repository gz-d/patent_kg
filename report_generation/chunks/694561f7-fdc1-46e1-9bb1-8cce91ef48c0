In other words, the first oscillator has its own first to fourth circuit arrangements and the second oscillator has its own first to fourth circuit arrangements.\n\n[0018] In some embodiments, the first circuit arrangement comprises a capacitive arrangement for facilitating oscilla- tion and a transmission line arrangement for power supply.\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nThe capacitive arrangement and the transmission line arrangement of the first circuit arrangement are arranged electrically in parallel. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement of the first circuit arrangement is grounded. In some examples, the capacitive arrangement of the first circuit arrangement comprises, or consists only of, a capaci- tor. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the first circuit arrangement is grounded. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the first circuit arrange- ment comprises, or consists only of, a curved transmission line. In some examples, the curved transmission line is a wavy transmission line with multiple bends.", "type": "Document"}}
