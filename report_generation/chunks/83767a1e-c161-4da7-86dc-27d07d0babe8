The Klip modification in DLAT was first confirmed using Western blot with a lipoic acid antibody (FIG. 3G). Subse- quently DLAT was incubated with Sirt2 in the presence of cofactor NAD+, and the lipoylation level of DLAT was examined by Western blot. Negative controls with no NAD+ or no Sirt2 were included as well. Comparing with the control groups, a substantial reduction was observed in the Klip level for DLAT treated with Sirt2 in the presence of NAD+.", "type": "Document"}}
