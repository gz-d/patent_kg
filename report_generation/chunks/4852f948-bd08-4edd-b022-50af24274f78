Note that in the Raman paths, two optical fibers are pumped to generate two new wavelengths, i.e., 545 nm and 558 nm. Each optical path is associated with a respective optical processing sub-unit. The half-wave plates HWP1 and HWP2 (WPH10E-532, Thorlabs Inc) upstream of the polar- izing beam-splitters PBS1 and PBS2 are arranged to adjust the power in the optical paths. Optionally, if needed, the luctuations of the laser pulse energy can be compensate using a photodiode (not shown). The average, standard deviation (SD) and drift of the pulsed light energy for these wavelengths (532 nm, 545 nm, 558 nm) were tested during 66.7 mins. The normalized average and SD for 532 nm, 545 nm, and 558 nm are 33545+24.4, 33887+36.5, and 34522245.5. And the energy drifts for these 3 wavelengths after 66.7 mins are 8%, 10% and 9%, which are relatively stable.", "type": "Document"}}
