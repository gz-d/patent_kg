It comprises two parts. The first part is a differentiator circuit 200 for differentiating the sensed capacitor current ic to real- ize equation (3). The second part is a voltage follower 220 that generates voltage v,, following the output of the differentia- tor 200. The preferred embodiment for v,, 116 may include a voltage sensor for sensing the voltage signal across the capacitor 110 or across any part or component ofan electronic circuit or system which exhibits capacitance and has associ- ated therewith parasitic inductance that would usefully be compensated to enhance the frequency response of the elec- tronic circuit or system.\n\nvale ctRsense}\n\nv, is further amplified by an inverting amplifier 430 formed by the operational amplifier A,, Ra, and R,.
