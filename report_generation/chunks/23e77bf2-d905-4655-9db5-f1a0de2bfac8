These divalent and/or trivalent ions form at least one ionic bond with each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material 210 or alginate. In other words, the ionic bond formed between each of the adjacent pair of polymer chains of the third polymeric material 210 or alginate may include a single type of cation and/or a combination of different types of cation.", "type": "Document"}}
