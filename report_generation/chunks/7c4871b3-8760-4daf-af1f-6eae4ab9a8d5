Before capaci- tors C, and C, have been charged up to a certain predefined threshold voltage (e.g., 10V), the respective driving logic in the respective circuits of the respective SDGD 212 andSDGD 214 will not be ready to operate in the desired steady state. Capacitors Cs and C, can be charged as the power supplies for riving switch 202 and switch 206, respectively. During the start-up stage, the capacitors C, and Cs, which respectively can be associated with (e.g., connected to) Rs (e.g., 50.0 MQ) and Rs (e.g., 50.0 MQ), can be designed (e.g., can have esired capacitance values) to be charged up quicker than capacitors Cr and Cs, until the capacitors C, and Cs reach a certain defined voltage, which can be determined by the zener diodes Dz, and Dz, respectively, contained in the SDGD component 212 and SDGD component 214. In an aspect, the bipolar transistors Qi and Q, can be used to facilitate ensuring the capacitors C, and C, will not be charged before capacitors C, and C, have been charged up to a voltage higher than the voltage of capacitors Ca and Cs. Therefore, as a result, the switch 202 and switch 204 will not switch before the respec- tive driving logic of the SDGD component 212 and SDGD component 214 has been set up to operate in normal operating", "type": "Document"}}
