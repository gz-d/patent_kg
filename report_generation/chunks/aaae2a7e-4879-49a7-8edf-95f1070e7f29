The secondary winding is coupled to the primary winding and provides the ac current to reduce the ripple in the load. When the primary current in the first inductor is increasing into the dotted terminal of the primary winding (i.e. changing posi- tively), ac flux caused by the increasing primary current is coupled to the secondary ac winding. The transformer action causes a current to flow out of the dotted terminal of the secondary winding into a capacitor in order to cancel the ac flux. Thus, the overall current ripple in the output of the coupled inductor (including both primary and secondary windings) and the load is reduced. Similarly, when the pri- mary current flowing into the dotted terminal of the primary winding is decreasing (i.e. changing negatively), the ac flux coupled to the secondary winding will cause a current to flow into the dotted terminal of the secondary winding and hence reduce the overall current ripple of the couple inductor. The effect of the coupled inductor on reducing the current ripple is illustrated in FIG. 4 (c).", "type": "Document"}}
