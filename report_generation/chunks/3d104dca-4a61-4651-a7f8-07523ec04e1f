[0023] Fig.8A shows a schematic of a planar inductive charging platform based on a single planar primary wind- ing 7 that surrounds a charging surface. In this context the term \"primary\" is used in the same sense as a trans- former, and the energy receiving element will comprises the \"secondary\". Fig.8B shows a schematic of planar in- ductive charging platform with a second auxiliary winding according to an embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen from Fig.8B, this embodiment of the present invention includes a first primary planar winding 7 that as in Fig.8A surrounds the charging surface, but further includes a second spiral primary planar winding 8 that is located within an area defined by the first and principal primary winding. Preferably the second auxiliary winding is located generally concentrically with the principal wind- ing so that the center of the spiral of the auxiliary winding is located in the center of the principal primary winding where the voltage sag is at its most extreme. [0024] Fig.9 shows the corresponding induced voltag- es that would be picked up by the secondary module due to the two excited windings (the principal primary winding and the auxiliary winding). The additional voltage (Curve Y) due to the magnetic flux generated by the auxiliary winding in the central region compensates for the central\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55", "type": "Document"}}
