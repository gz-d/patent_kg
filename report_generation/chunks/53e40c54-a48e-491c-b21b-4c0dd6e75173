To select or apply a particular barrier pattern to video content, a specified voltage, which can correspond to the selected display mode and particular barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern, can be applied by the barrier compo- nent 108 to one or more electrodes or other electronic com- ponents that can facilitate selection of the particular barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern. With the desired barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern selected and applied, the barrier component 108 can receive the visual images 104 (e.g., standard 2-D content, enhanced 2-D content for conver- sion to 3-D content) provided to the projector screen compo- nent 102 and can pass or transmit the received visual images 104 through the selected barrier pattern in the selected barrier pattern mode.", "type": "Document"}}
