The two-ears patterns with the front locations (with thin hair) and the back locations (with thin skin) yielded higher accuracy than the rest of the patterns did. These results are consistent with the existing psychophysical studies on the thermal sensitivity of human beings as mentioned above.\n\n[0113] According to the results of Study 2 and 3, in total fourteen spatial thermal patterns were selected as shown in FIG. 13, as the set of spatial thermal icons for ThermEar- hook. The average accuracy for the users recognizing the chosen one-ear multi-points thermal patterns was 80.2%, and 88.4% for the two-ears patterns. Overall, the two-ears patterns are more accurate than the one-ear ones, as the increased distance between the two individual stimuli for the two-ears patterns improve the spatial acuity for thermal perception.\n\n[0114] Study 4: Evaluating the Chosen Set of Spatial Thermal Patterns\n\n[0115] While Study 2 and 3 found a set of hot and cold thermal patterns/icons with considerable identification accu- racy, they are tested in separated sessions. It is still unknown how accurate humans can perceive the patterns when testing them all together. In Study 4, these two-point simultaneous thermal patterns were tested together, to investigate the feasibility of using them together as a set of thermal icons.\n\n[0116]\n\nParticipants\n\n[0117] We recruited another 12 university students who didn\u2019t have any prior experience with thermal haptics (4 female and 8 male, averagely aging 26.7 years old). The average skin temperature was 32.2\u00b0 C. (SD=1.5). The ambi- ent indoor temperature was controlled to be 25\u00b0 C.\n\n[0118] Apparatus\n\n[0119] \u2018The same apparatus as those used in Study 2 and used.\n\nwas\n\n3\n\nUS 2023/0122309 Al\n\n[0120] Study Design", "type": "Document"}}
