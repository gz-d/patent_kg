No. 12/435,941, by CHUNG et entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPRESS- ING NOISE CAUSED BY PARASITIC CAPACITANCE AND/OR RESISTANCE IN AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT SYSTEM\u201d; and\n\nvoltage ripple at the output of the filter, conducted noise at the input of the filter, and resonance with the other components and parasitic element in the circuit. FIG. 3 shows a buck converter 30 with prior art capacitors 10 as the input and output capacitors. The supply source 32 of the converter 30 is v,,,. The duty time of the switching element S 34 is adjusted to control the output voltage 36 across the load. FIG. 4 depicts the effects of ESL and ESR on the output voltage of the buck converter 30 when there is a sudden load change. The initial voltage spike 40 is firstly caused by ESL. Then, the effect of the ESR that causes a voltage step 41 that follows. After the transient period settles, the capacitor 10 will discharge to the load 36. Thus, it is crucial to cancel the effects caused the ESL and ESR.\n\nPatent application Ser.
