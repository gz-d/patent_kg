Raw traces of walking pattern as well as video were saved for future analysis. EMG data recording were syn- chronized manually with video kinematics recording for finding the pattern of gait cycle with EMG. Same time frame was selected to correlate the EMG activity peak with the tracing of the video kinematics. The arrows in FIGS. 6A and 6B indicate the swing phase of the EMG with video kine- matics. The control group shows a normal range of stance and swing time, while the DKO group shows an ataxic gait by increased variation of stance and swing times, exagger- ated hind limb flexion and significant increase in the stance\n\nAnalysis of Neuronal Data\n\n[0095] The inventors further determined the electrophysi- ological properties of deep cerebellar nuclei neurons during motor movement period of the mice. After recovering from the implantation, recording connector of acquisition system was attached with electrode connector fixed on the mice\u2019s head using mild isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were acclima- tized in the cage with wire for 15 minutes and recording was performed. Time was recorded for step-up and step-down time to find the changes occurring during the walking of the mice.\n\n[0096] As shown in FIG. 4A to FIG. 4C, DKO mice showed a significant increase in mean firing rate, an increase in number of bursts per minute, and a decrease in inter spike interval.\n\nDeep Cerebellar Nuclei Electrode Stimulation", "type": "Document"}}
