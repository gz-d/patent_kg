Since the 2D-XT and 2D-YT plane have the similar effects in capturing the motion features, the dictionary learning function for 2D-XT plane is used and can be derived from Equation (1) as\n\n\u4eba . 1 Piss Se) =) es + Moll te 1, else\n\nel, \u4e00 las + \u4eba 9) He wu yo ad ai 7 llatevll, +llowol + Aye. vib = | \u4e00 1, else\n\n- 2 min 1IX22 \u2014wa?P|i> st lo \u5404 lb <e (7\n\noriginal \u2018patch Yun rae and the distorted patch ye 4 with respect to the learned dictionary ye? by Equation (7), respectively.
