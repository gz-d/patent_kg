For each 2-D image of the enhanced 2-D video content, such 2-D image can comprise visual information for all of the different positions or perspectives of the 3-D scene, wherein the barrier component, employing the appropriate barrier pat- tern in accordance with the appropriate barrier pattern mode, can use the visual information to reconstruct all of the 2-D images from the various different visual perspectives to reconstruct the 3-D image based at least in part on the various reconstructed 2-D images of the different visual perspectives. The enhanced 2-D video content and/or the captured or gen- erated visual information can be stored in the data store 708.\n\nThe system 700 also can comprise a processor component 706 that can work in conjunction with the other components (e.g., capture component 702, render component 704, etc.) to facilitate performing the various functions of the system 700. The processor component 706 can employ one or more pro- cessors, microprocessors, or controllers that can process data, such as information (e.g., visual information) relating to areal or synthesized 3-D scene, data relating to parameters associ- ated with the system 700 and associated components, etc., to facilitate capturing, generating, synthesizing, and rendering visual information relating to or representative of a 3-D scene; and can control data flow between the system 700 and other components associated with the system 700 and data flow between the various of the 700.", "type": "Document"}}
