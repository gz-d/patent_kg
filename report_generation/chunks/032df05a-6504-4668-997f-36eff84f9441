Electrospinning process, for example, performed in an electrospinning device at voltage of 26 kV, an advance rate of 0.5 at room temperature, distance of tip-to-collector at cm.\n\nml/h\n\n10\n\n[0026] 2) Preparation of a mixed solvent\n\n[0027] a) preparation of a mixed solvent, characterized in that the solubility of the polymer in the solvent is in certain range and that the contact angle the mixed solvent on the electrospun film is in certain range.\n\nmixed of\n\n[0028] 3) Post-processing the electrospun film\n\n[0029] a) uniform coating, for example spin coating dip coating, the electrospun film with the mixed solvent prepared in step 2a), in certain proportion to the weight of the electrospun film\n\nor\n\n[0030] b) hot-pressing and drying the coated electro- spun film prepared in step 3a), preferably for 1-2 hours. Post-processed electrospun films with bonded struc- tures are then prepared.\n\n[0031] Embodiments prepared with general steps described above but with specific formulations and condi- tions are illustrated below. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is selected as illustrative examples for embodiments 1-8 and 17 as materials to prepare an electrospun film. Thermoplas- tic polyurethane (TPU) is selected as illustrative examples for embodiments 9-16 and 18 as materials to prepare an electrospun film.\n\nEmbodiment 1\n\n[0032] Bonded PVDF electrospun film (the following parts are parts by weight):\n\n[0033] 1) Prepare a mixed solvent of DMF (Dimethyl- formamide) and water, the ratio is 60:40, the solubility of PVDF in the mixed solvent is 9.8%, and the contact angle of the mixed solvent on the electrospun film 4l\u00b0.\n\nis\n\n[0034]", "type": "Document"}}
