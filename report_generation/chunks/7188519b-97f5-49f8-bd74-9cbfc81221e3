They are then washed and lightly digested with 10 hg/ml proteinase K in PBT (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) before incubating with the antisense probes in situ hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5xSSC, 50 heg/m1 Heparin, 500 ug/ml tRNA, 9 mM citric acid, pH 6.0, and 0.1% Tween 20) at 65-70\u00b0 C. overnight. Following hybridization, probes are removed with high-stringency washes. In brief, embryos are washed twice in 50% Formamide: 50% (2xSSC/ 0.1%). Tween-20), each for 30 minutes, followed by 2xSSC/ 0.1% Tween-20 at 65\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, 2xSSC and 0.2x SSC each twice for 30 min, at 65\u00b0 C. Embryos were subsequently incubated with pre-absorbed sheep anti-digoxi- genin-alkaline phosphatase Fab fragments (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on a nutator at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. After washing 6 times in PBT, 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate was added. as substrate and nitro blue tetrazolium as coupler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for color staining.", "type": "Document"}}
