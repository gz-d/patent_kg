In this example, the metasurface is represented or described by an array of subwavelength scatterers with the discrete nature of the metasurface. The universal metasurface antenna 400 includes an array of slot opening based meta-atoms etched on the top conductive layer of the substrate integrated waveguide along the x-axis (FIG. 23). In this example, the anisotropic slot opening meta-atom is equivalent to two orthogonally orientated waveguide-fed magnetic dipoles to extract energy from the waveguide and radiate to free space.\n\nThe wave properties of the extracted Iu) and IW compo- nents can be independently controlled by applying indepen- dent control voltages to the PIN diodes incorporated in the meta-atom (FIG. 24).
