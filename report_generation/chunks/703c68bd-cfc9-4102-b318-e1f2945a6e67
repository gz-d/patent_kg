The barrier control component 110, utilizing the sensor component, can monitor or scan information, such as the signal, being emitted from or presented by the control region 112 in relation to presentation of the video content on the projector screen component 102.\n\nDuring the monitoring or scanning, the barrier contro component 110 can detect (e.g., automatically or dynami- cally in real time) the signal presented (e.g., emitted) from the control region 112 of the projector screen component 102. The barrier control component 110 can analyze and identify the signal as being one particular signal of the plurality o available types of signals, based at least in part on the infor- mation in the detected signal. The barrier control component 110 can identify the type of visual content and/or the desired display mode (and/or desired barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern) for such video content, based at least in part on the type (e.g., pattern type) or data value of the identified signal. For example, the respective signals (e.g., optical sig- nals) can be mapped to corresponding types of visual content and/or corresponding display modes (and/or desired barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern). The barrier control com- ponent 110 can analyze the mapping associated with a par- ticular received signal to identify the type of visual content or desired display mode (and/or desired barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern) for such content.", "type": "Document"}}
