The results indicate the healthy status of the two users. The higher the R.L and S.L values, the higher the risk of cardiovascular disease like hypertension, cardiovascular infarction.\n\n[0103]\n\nA wearable physiological monitoring system con-\n\nnecting the electronic fabric is further developed for ECG detection. As shown in FIG. 5G, the main components of the system are exhibited, including data acquisition and pro- cessing unit, wireless data transmission module, etc. A circuit that used a frequency divider circuit structure to transform the resistance of the electronic fabric into a voltage, which is then converted to the digital domain by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), is also designed. The analog output of the driver circuit is synchronously digitized using a high-precision ADC chip. The digital signals are processed by a microcontroller (ATMega328) and then, transmitted wirelessly at 100 Hz via a Bluetooth module (HC-06). A Bluetooth receiver is used to convert the digital signals from the DMWES into analyzable data for smart- phones. The electronic fabric is led out from both ends of the interdigital electrode through copper tapes and then, con- nected to the PCB. The user 1 s ECG signal is received by putting the electronic membrane on the chest. The generated ECG pulse signal is extracted from the pulse system and observed for ~71 BPM, which proves the good healthy state of the user 1 (FIG. 21). These health parameters are of great\n\nsignificance in cardiovascular disease monitoring.", "type": "Document"}}
