It is reported that TAF15 is an RNA binding protein in mouse tissues. Therefore, the present invention re-studies the TAF15 CLIP-seq data in the mouse brain, and ound that TAF15 does significantly bind to XIST IncRNA, and the binding cluster enrichment degree exceeded the expected 9 times (FIG. 26, FIG. 2c). In order to study whether the binding of TAF15 depends on its biochemical binding affinity to XIST IncRNA sequence characteristics, a library containing 40-nt RNA transcripts and random sequences is used in the present invention to perform HTR-SELEX experiments on TAF15 (FIG. 8a, FIG. 84). HTR-SELEX identified significant enrichment of RNA sequence motifs of TAF15 (FIG. 8c), similar to previous reports. Given that the abundant hairpin structure in XIST IncRNA may lead to dinucleotide interdependence, the effect of RNA sequence on TAF 15 binding cannot be fully described by a simple position weight matrix model. There- ore, a k-mer-based machine learning algorithm (gkm-SVM) is used in the present invention, and HTR-SELEX data is used to model the RNA binding specificity of the human TAF15 protein (FIG. 8d). Consistent with the WB and MS results, the HTR-SELEX results further support that the affinity of locus 1 and 2 where TAF15 binds to XIST\n\nIncRNA is higher than\n\nlocus 3 (FIG. 2e).", "type": "Document"}}
