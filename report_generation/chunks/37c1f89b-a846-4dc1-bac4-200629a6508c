Each\n\nOne important aspect of this invention at least in its pre\n\nsystem consists of a diode rectifier, a valley-fill circuit for\n\nimproving the input power factor, an inductor for turning the\n\nferred forms is to provide a way to reduce the size of the\n\ncapacitors that is needed so that capacitors other than the\n\nVoltage source into a current source with reduced current\n\n60\n\nelectrolytic type can be used.
