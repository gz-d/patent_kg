Each thermoelectric module comprises a p type semicon- ductor element 212 and a n type semiconductor element 214 positioned adjacent or in contact with each other. In the illustrated example the semiconductor elements 212, 214 are positioned adjacent each other and spaced from each other. The device 200 comprises conductor members 216 connect- ing adjacent semiconductor elements. Adjacent thermoelec- tric modules 210 are interconnected to each other by con- ductor members 216.
