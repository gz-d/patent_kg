For instance, to obtain optical performance mea- surements, exemplary embodiments (e.g., GA 300, GA 500, GA 700, etc.) can be placed on a rotator 2702 that facilitates measuring output voltage of the one or more solar cell panels (e.g., 302, 502, 704, etc.) at different illumination angles (6) 2704. A light source 2706 having a wide spectrum (e.g., a xenon light source) that can mimic natural daylight can be used to illuminate the exemplary embodiments. In addition, a parabolic optical dish 2708 (e.g., a parabolic optical dish with circular aperture of diameter=60 cm) can be used to used to reflect light from the light source 2706 and generate a nearly parallel light beam 2710 at a distance X (2512)=200 cm from various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. While using an optical lens can produce a relatively more parallel light beam, it can difficult to obtain such a big lens commer- cially for measurement purposes. As described above, height H 518 can be found experimentally by optimizing the voltage output of the one or more solar cell panels (e.g., 302, 502, etc.)", "type": "Document"}}
