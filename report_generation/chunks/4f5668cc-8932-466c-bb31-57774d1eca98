It can be seen clearly from the ideal model of FIG. 2a that the relation between the longitudinal displacement 4 and the compression force C is essentially elasto-plastic if the stress-strain relation of the web steel member 53 is elasto-plastic. It should be noted that \u201celasto-plastic\u201d refers to a load-deformation rela- tion where there is an elastic stage in which the deformation is in direct proportion to the load, followed by a plastic stage in which the deformation increases though the load remains constant. A mild steel plate was used to make the web member 53, and therefore, the stress-strain relation could be consid- ered as approximately elasto-plastic. Referring to FIG. 26, a first steel mechanism 50a was made from two 10 mm thick by 150 mm mild steel plates 25 that were bent and welded together at their ends. Four 12 mm mild steel bars 26 were used as the web member 53 that penetrated through and were bolted into the middle of the two bent steel plates 25, as shown in FIG. 24. The middle of the two plates 25 was grinded to reduce their thickness in order to reduce the moment resis- tance of the plate 25 at the joint. This mechanism relied on the ductile elongation of the web member 53 to provide ductile compressive deformation of the mechanism 50a. It was found. in the test that this mechanism 50a (FIG. 24) did not work", "type": "Document"}}
