These operations are more time-consuming when being performed instead by the sofiware processor as software processors or other generic computer processors are not specifically designed for performing these complex calculations, however data such as numbers or polynomials may be handled by hardware processors which include processing logics specifically designed for the data/numbers\n\nin specific formats, such as bit-length.\n\nUS 2024/0143524 Al\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n[0055] In addition, the processor further comprises an interconnection interface 106 arranged to exchange data between the hardware processor and the software processor. The interconnection interface is also specifically designed for handing data of specific types or formats to facilitate the high-speed operations of the hardware accelerator modules to achieve a high throughput of the calculation results.\n\n[0056] Preferably, the interconnection interface includes a high-performance interface 106A and a general-purpose low performance interface 106B arranged to exchange difference types of data between the hardware processor 102 and the software processor 104. By separating the communication of different types of data, better utilization of the \u201chigh-speed\u201d communication channel may be achieved, such that the computation data may be provided to the software processor 104 as soon as the computational results are determined by the hardware processor 102.", "type": "Document"}}
