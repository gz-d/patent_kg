For a given feature, a certain threshold of missing values will be\n\napplied to eliminate samples with a missing rate equal to or greater than the threshold. Since there are different objectives for each of the four modules, the models present in the different modules have different requirements for the usage of the structured data. The models of each module select data related to their purpose as relevant data, and irrelevant data are excluded in that particular element. The data imputation 304, which receives data from the second filter 303, performs the imputation of missing data. Imputation is the process of replacing missing data (including \u201cNA\u201d, \u201cNone\u201d, \u201cNot record\u201d etc.) with substituted values. Imputation methods including min-max imputation, mean imputation, non-negative matrix factorization, regression imputation, stochastic imputation, or multiple imputation method are applied in the data imputation 304. The data imputation 304 provides the imputed data to data normalization 305. Normalization refers to the process of adjusting values measured on different scales to a notionally common scale. Continuity data for different data ranges are redistributed within the range from 0 to 1 by data normalization 305 according to the distribution characteristics of the data itself. The data normalization 305 provides the normalized data to feature selection 306. The feature selection 306 is a function generator element which provides the optimize data to models. Redundant data are eliminated by different feature selection methods. Different feature selectors are applied to calculate the importance of each feature, and features are selected according to the importance\n\n20\n\nranking. The output of the feature selection 306 is called the processed structured data\n\n307.\n\n25\n\n30\n\n[0046]", "type": "Document"}}
