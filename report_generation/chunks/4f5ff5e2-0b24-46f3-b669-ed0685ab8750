The negligible electricity generation from triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is limited by the interfacial effect, though its PTFE surface Is loaded with sufficient charges as In the case of TIDE-G. The frequency of impinging droplets is set at 4.2 Hz.\n\nFig. 2c is a graph illustrating a comparison of current output from TIDE-G (right portion of figure) and the control device (left portion of figure) in response to continuous impinging of individual droplets.\n\nFIGS. 3a to 3d illustrates an origin of boosted electricity generation, in which:\n\nFig.\n\nthe\n\n3a is a graph showing time-resolved current variation generated from the TIDE-G entire droplet impact process.\n\nFig. 3b is a graph showing synchronization of droplet spreading dynamics and current response as well as mapping the time-dependent variation of charges flowing between PTFE/ITO and drain electrode. The droplet retracts but still keeps in contact with the drain electrode, while the current reverses to a negative value. Insets are the selected snapshots showing droplet dynamics on TIDE-G.\n\nFig. 3c is a graph showing time-dependent variation of the transferred charge Q generated on TIDE-G by an impinging droplet, indicating that the charge can be fully go back to zero when the TIDE-G transits to the switching-off mode. Cyclic measurements show the superior reversibility in the charge transfer. Notably, the amount of charge transferred between the source and drain in each cycle is constant, a signature that there is no additional charge supply from PTFE or water, although the charge transfer or electricity generation is gated by the soft, configurable water droplet.", "type": "Document"}}
