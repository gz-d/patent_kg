In some embodiments, the fixation means contributes to increased magnetic field flux. The fixation means can be configured according to practical needs. As illustrated in the present embodiment, the fixation means includes a first fixation means 242 and a second fixation means 244 such that the electric coil 230 is posi- tioned or limited between the two fixation means. Each of the first and second fixation means 242, 244 has a cylindrical shape with a hole in the middle that allows a respective end of the magnetic core 220 and a respective end of the elongated sleeve 210 to pass through. In some embodiments, each of the first and second fixation means has a polygonal shape. Other shapes may also be possible. The fixation means 242, 244 may be fastened to one or more other parts of the electromagnetic device 200 via fasteners, such as\n\nscrews.\n\n[0054] By way of example, the cone radius R1 is ina range from 5 mm to 15 mm. The length L of the magnetic core 220 is in a range from 500 mm to 600 mm. The height H of the core tip 226 is in a range from 50 mm to 60 mm. The radius R2 of the magnetic core 220 is in a range from 30 mm to 40 mm. The length of the elongated sleeve 210 is in a range from 400 mm to 500 mm. The diameter of the elongated sleeve 210 is in a range from 50 mm to 60 mm.\n\n[0055] By way of example, as illustrated in FIG. 2A, the center of a workspace is located at point O, which is the\n\nUS 2024/0145145 Al\n\norigin of a XOZ coordinate system. D refers to the distance between the core tip 226 (more specifically, the end of the core tip 226 proximate to the point O) and point O. In some embodiments, D=80 mm, and the magnetic flux density at point O can be in a range from 1 mT to 225 mT, and the magnetic field gradient at point O can be in a range from 0.1 T/m to 15 T/m.", "type": "Document"}}
