This planar PCB transformer technology has been applied in a range of applications. In 2004, it was used by for a contactless battery charger for mobile phone in Choi B., Nho J., Cha H. and Choi S., \u201cDesign and implementation of low-profile con- tactless battery charger using planar printed circuit board windings as energy transfer device,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 51, No. 1, February 2004, pp. 140-147. Choi et al uses one planar winding as a primary charging pad and a separate planar winding as a secondary winding as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIG. 5 shows the equivalent electrical circuit diagram of this contactless charg- ing system. As explained in Choi et al, the circuit operation of the coreless PCB transformer is based on the theory proposed by Hui etal. It should be noted that the primary circuit is based on the resonant circuit described in Hui et al, while the front power stage of the secondary circuit is a standard winding witha diode rectifier that provides the rectified DC voltage for\n\nFIG. 1B shows the device required for the charging plat- orm of FIG. 1A. This consists of a magnetic core 3 and a winding. In order for the winding to sense the AC flux, the flux must flow into the cross-sectional area (shaded in FIG. 1B). Therefore, this cross-sectional area must be large enough so that enough flux and energy can be picked up by the second- ary device. It should be noted that this secondary device must be housed inside the electronic equipment to be charged on the charging platform. The thickness of the secondary device is crucial to the applicability and practicality of the device. If it is too thick, it simply cannot be housed in the electronic equipment.\n\nTwo main problems suffered by the charging system of FIG. 5 proposed by Choi et al include: (1) The planar winding", "type": "Document"}}
