FIG . 13A showed the XRD pattern of a\n\nUS 2021/0013551 Al\n\nJan. 14, 2021\n\ndeposited MnO,@SS mesh electrode, in which all charac- teristic peaks were well-indexed to Akhtenskite MnO, (JICPDS 30-0820).\n\nratio of the AD-gel remained unchanged under the same experimental conditions. This may be abscribed to the synergies of EG and elastomer coating of the AD-gel. In addition, an AD-gel electrolyte with arbitrary shape was immersed in a dye bath for 1 h. It was found that the color was readily washed away by clean water (FIG. 11). This result may reveal that the elastomer coating retards the mass exchange between the inner organohydrogel matrix with the outer environment. In other words, the coating may have perfectly sealed the hydrogel with arbitrary shape from external environment.", "type": "Document"}}
