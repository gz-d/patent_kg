As shown in FIG . 1D ,\n\nZIKV + RNA was detectable inside host cells after 90\n\nminutes of viral infection in the presence of extracellular\n\nCa2 + , whereas no positive viral RNA was detected in host\n\ncells after 90 minutes of the viral infection in the absence of\n\nextracellular Ca2 + . Moreover , in the host cells in the absence\n\nof extracellular Ca2 + , intact virirons ( staining with ZIKV\n\nenvelope proteins ) were detected in the plasma membrane of\n\nhost cells as shown in the right panel of FIG . 1D . These\n\nOH\n\nresults suggest that Ca2 + influx is required for flavivirus\n\nentry of host cells .\n\nUS 2021/0060002 A1\n\nMar. 4, 2021\n\nbamine or its analogue as described above. The enterovirus may be EV-A71, and the lentivirus may encode histone B-REP.\n\n[0077] With reference to FIG. 1E, in cells treated with BAPTA-AM, a calcium chelator, no ZIKV positive RNA strand was spotted inside the host cells. It was also found that BAPTA-AM treatment of host cells markedly inhibited the expression of JEV envelope protein in a dose dependent manner, as shown in FIG. 1F. Again, these date suggest that intracellular calcium signaling is involved in flavivirus infection of host cells. Similar data have also been observed for EV-A71 infection of host cells (data not shown). These data together support the role of Ca influx or intracellular Ca?* in flavivirus or enterovirus infections.", "type": "Document"}}
