The residual block D is integer image transformed in step 320 (e.g. by an ICT) to produce the transformed residual block F*. The block F* is scaled in step 330 and then quantized in a separate step 340 to produce a quantized transformed residual block Z. The block Z is entropy encoded in step 350 and the number of bits required to entropy encode the block is noted. In step 360 the block Z is inverse quantized to obtain inverse quantized residual block F. The block F is then inverse scale trans- ormed in step 370 and inverse integer image transformed in step 380 (by the reverse of the operation of step 320). This provides a reconstructed residual block DB. The original block is then reconstructed from the residual block using inter or intra prediction to arrive at reconstructed block C in step 340. The SSD between the source block S and the reconstructed block C is finally calculated in step 395. This gives a measure\n\nThe particular position regions, quantization points and boundaries in the tables of FIGS. 3 and 6 are examples only and are determined by the ICT transform and the H.264/AVC standard. If another image or video encoding standard is used, then the tables will have different position regions, quantiza- tion points and boundaries which can easily be determined by consulting the encoding standard in question.\n\nIn the preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 8 the separate scaling, quantizing, inverse quantizing, inverse scaling, inverse integer image transform and block reconstruction steps 330, 340, 360, 370, 380 and 390 are eliminated and replaced with an iterative lookup table process 440.\n\nOperation of the circuit 520 will now be discussed in detail, being understood that the other circuits 530, 540 etc operate the same way.", "type": "Document"}}
