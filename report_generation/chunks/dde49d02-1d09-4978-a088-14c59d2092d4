With the load resistance increase from 1 KO to 100 MO, the output voltage was measured to vary from 0.45 V to 170 V and the output current decreased from 410 pA to 1.55 nA. When a load resistance was 33.2 KO, the maximum output power-density was 69.8 W/m?.\n\n[0060] FIG. 18 is a schematic diagram showing negative and positive charges fixed on the atomic layers of PTFE and the ITO electrode, respectively.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
