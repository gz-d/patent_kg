In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can be low power (e.g., can employ components using low power), wherein the power supplied to the SDGD subsystem can be provided by the AC voltage source or preferably at least a portion of the rectified output signal from the synchronous rectifier. In an embodiment, the SDGD subsystem, or a desired portion thereof, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In an aspect, the SDGD subsystem can comprise a high-side portion and a low-side portion that can be symmetrical. With the arrangement of SDGD sub- system and the switches (e.g., power MOSFETs), the syn- chronous rectifier can thereby be a self-driven synchronous rectifier. In another aspect, the switches can form and/or emulate a diode bridge. In an aspect, even if the SDGD subsystem is not ready for full or steady-state operation, for example, immediately at the start-up of the synchronous rec- tifier (or at another period of time when the SDGD subsystem is not operating at steady-state operation), the synchronous rectifier can still function the same as or substantially similar to a diode bridge (e.g., bridge-rectifier type functionality is inherent in the synchronous rectifier) because the body diodes of the MOSFETs are arranged in the circuit to form a tradi- tional diode rectifier circuit. Before the output DC voltage of the rectifier is ready to power the control circuitry for switch- ing the MOSFETs, these body diodes can facilitate enabling the MOSFETs to act as a normal diode rectifier during the start-up process. In still another aspect, the system can include a zero-cross controller component(s) that can facili- tate providing a desired positive voltage signal to a compara- tor(s)", "type": "Document"}}
