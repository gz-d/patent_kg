This integral vaporizing and supply means is connected to the remainder of the PBII apparatus by means of a quick release flange 10. By means of the quick release flange 10, the inte- gral vaporizing and supply means may be removed if not needed and in its place a supply conduit for a gaseous plasma forming material may be used if the material to be implanted is one that is gaseous under standard conditions.\n\nby\n\nupper region\n\nvacuum\n\nprovided\n\na\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 8,119,208 B2\n\n6\n\n5\n\nIn the presently described preferred embodiment of the\n\nAlternatively the feed conduit 4 may be closed off alto\n\ngether and plasma may be supplied to the vacuum chamber 1\n\ninvention, the mean free path of the vaporized Sulfur atoms is\n\nin a conventional manner elsewhere, and the implantation\n\nmuch larger than the diameter of the feed conduit 4 and thus\n\nchamber 2 may be removed, thus allowing an embodiment of\n\nthe vapor enters the feed conduit 4 in the form of a laminar\n\nthe invention to be integrated into a conventional PBII appa\n\nflow.
