The radiology examination report may include the body text and the standardized code of examination of the radiology examination report. The clinical and discharge note may include the dates of discharge and/or admission and the body text of the clinical documentation. For the clinical report, a sequence order number by reference datetime among all clinical result datasets for identifying the clinical report record is necessary to ensure its correctness. For merging the patient records, an episode key assigned to the patient upon attendance for the examination and a unique patient key assigned to each individual patient are required\n\n25\n\nby the data collection module 104.\n\n30\n\n[0035]\n\nIn the various embodiments, image data element 103 contains image data for\n\nthe patients fulfilling some criteria by hospital, for example the CT Brain for brain plain.
