As shown in FIG. 2, the antenna loo has wide impedance bandwidth of 69%, with S11<-10 from 20.3 GHz to 41.7 GHz, and a peak gain of 5.3 dBi.\n\n[0065] FIGS. 3A to 3C show simulated radiation patterns for the antenna 100 of FIGS. 1A to 1C at 23 GHz, 30 GHz and 40 GHz respectively. As shown in these Figures, in both E and H planes, the end-fire radiation patterns are stable. Also, low back radiation is observed across the entire operating bandwidth.\n\n[0060] As shown in FIG. 1C, a ground plane 110 for microstrip line feeding is formed on the bottom side 103 o the antenna 100. In this example, the ground plane 110 is integrally formed with the elongated conductive strip por- tion 108D and the conductive patch portion 108E.\n\n[0066] the feed network 212, 312 of the top layer 202, 302. In the embodiment of FIG. 4A, the feed network 212 includes first and second conductive strips 212A, 212B (generally elon- gated, not straight) operably connected with each other via a common portion 222. Each strip 212A, 212B is connected. with a respective via at the terminal end (the bottom layer has corresponding via locations). In the embodiment of FIG. 4B, the feed network 312 includes first and second conduc- tive strips 312A, 312B (generally elongated, not straight) operably connected with each other via a common portion 322. Each of the strips 212A, 212B is connected with a respective via near its open end (the bottom layer has", "type": "Document"}}
