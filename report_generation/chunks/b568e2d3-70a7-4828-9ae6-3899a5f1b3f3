In particular, the encap- sulation step may include the step of immersing the sand- wiched structure into a solution of silane-modified PDMS. In this example, the solution may contain a Pt catalyst with a concentration of for example 0.1% v/w and a silane- modified PDMS precursor. The silane-modified PDMS pre- cursor may include a curing agent of Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) and a liquid base at a weight ratio of 10:1, and TEOVS (i.e. second coupling agent).\n\n[0195] At this stage, the as-obtained hydrogel includes covalently crosslinked PAAm network functionalized with TMSPMA with un-crosslinked alginate chains dispersed among the PAAm network. The as-prepared hydrogel may be peeled off and optionally dried under room temperature or an elevated temperature.\n\n[0203] The sandwiched structure may be repeatedly immersed into the solution of silane-modified PDMS for at least 5 times so to have suflicient amount of the solution retaining on the surface of the sandwiched structure.

In one example, the electrolytic solution may contain zinc(II) sulphate at a concentration of for example 2 mol L ~' and Li2SO4 at a concentration of for example 0.5 mol L~?. In another example, the electrolytic solution may contain H,PO, at concentration of for example 2 wt %.\n\na\n\nJan. 14 , 2021\n\nUS 2021/0013551 A1\n\n11\n\nhydrogel matrix .
