[0015] Preferably the second winding is located con- centrically with respect to said first winding. [0016] The first and second windings may be planar windings preferably located in the same plane, or may be planar windings located in parallel planes. [0017] The first and second windings may be formed as conductive coils, or may be formed as conductive tracks on one or more printed circuit boards. [0018] The first and second windings may be connect- ed together in series or in parallel, and may be driven in the same phase and the same polarity or may be driven independently. [0019] The first winding may preferably extend about the periphery of the charging surface and the second winding may be located at the center of said charging surface. Preferably the second winding is a spiral wind- ing. The first winding and the second winding may be generally rectangular or circular. [0020] In cases where a single second winding is in- sufficient to compensate for voltage sag, a third winding is provide located within said area defined by said first winding.", "type": "Document"}}
