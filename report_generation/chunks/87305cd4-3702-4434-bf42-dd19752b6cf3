The large capacitance of electrolytic capacitors is usu- ally needed to provide a stable de link voltage for the ballast circuit to provide stable power (with reduced power variation) for the load; a stable de power supply in the electronic control for the inverter circuit.\n\nFIG. 1 shows the schematic of a typical off-line lighting system. An off-line system here means a system that can be powered by the ac mains. The power conversion circuit can adopt a two-stage approach in which an AC-DC power stage with power factor correction is used as the first power stage, which is followed by a second de-de power conversion stage for controlling the current for LED load. An alternative to the two-stage approach is to employ a single-stage approach\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided an LED lighting system comprising in sequence: (a) a rectifica- tion circuit for rectifying an AC input power and generating a rectified DC power, (b) a first circuit for reducing the voltage ripple of said rectified DC power, (c) a second circuit having\n\nLED technology has been promoted as a promising light-\n\n374].\n\npower\n\n10\n\n15\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nwhich combines the two power stages into one and such a\n\ncapacitors.\n\nAn electronic ballast circuit without the use of electrolytic\n\npassive circuit.\n\nUS 8,482,214 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\neye.
