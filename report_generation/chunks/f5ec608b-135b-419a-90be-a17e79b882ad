The 3-D autostereoscopic con- tent, which can comprise a specified number of respective views (e.g., respective 2-D views) that make up the 3-D image, can be presented as an output (e.g., views 1 through 7 (V1 through V7) as depicted in FIG. 1) by the barrier com- ponent 108 for viewing by a viewer. It is to be appreciated and understood that the above example barrier patterns are just a few of the various types of barrier patterns that can be employed in accordance with the disclosed subject matter, and all such various barrier pattern types are contemplated for", "type": "Document"}}
