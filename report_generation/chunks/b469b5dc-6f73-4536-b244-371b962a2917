Preferably, the plurality of receptors is specific to the target substance, forming a physical interaction with the target substance upon contact, thereby capturing the target substance. For example, the plurality of receptors may form at least one of electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic inter- actions, or a complementary shape with the target substance upon contact.\n\nembodiment of an electrochemical detector comprising a solution chamber and a substance selection structure sepa- rating the chamber into individual compartments, the solu- tion chamber is arranged to retain and separate solutions in each of the individual compartments; and a pair of elec- trodes each connecting the respective individual compart- ment, wherein the pair of electrodes is arranged to form a conductive path across the electrodes when in contact with the solutions retained in the solution chamber; wherein the substance selection structure is arranged to interact with a target substance in the solution so as to alter an electrical characteristic of the conductive path defined by the pair of electrodes, the solution retained in the individual compart- ments in the solution chamber and the substance selection", "type": "Document"}}
