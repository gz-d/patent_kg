In an exemplary embodiment, the clamp 52 can be coated with a material, such as polyethylene, on the internal surface thereof to reduce or dissipate the correction force or energy generated by the support member 10. The correction force can be controlled by varying the coating material or the gripping force of the clamp 52. In another exemplary embodi- ment, one or more braking elements 50 can be in the form of an adjustable screw or washer element 54. Depending on how tight the adjustable screw or washer element 54 is adjusted, the braking element 50 is capable of providing a variable braking force to the support member 10, thereby controlling the correction force. It will be appreciated that other embodi- ments of the braking elements 50 are also within the scope of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
