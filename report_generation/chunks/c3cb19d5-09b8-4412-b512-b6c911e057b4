Ina preferred embodiment an integer cosine transform (ICT) is used. Alternatively a Hadamard transform ora Walsh transform could be used. Other possibilities will be apparent to a person skilled in the art.\n\nThis method is similar to the first aspect of the present invention, but less restrictive in that the image transform does not need to be an integer image transform and therefore pre-scaling may not be necessary. For example, the image transform may be a Discrete Cosine Transform. The method has the advantage that the sum of squared differences is calculated in the transformed residual domain and so the computations involved in reconstruction and the inverse transform are avoided.\n\nA second aspect of the present invention provides a method of calculating the distortion caused by encoding image or video data according to a first encoding mode, the method comprising carrying out the first aspect of the invention, wherein in step (a) the predicted block is computed according to said first encoding mode and wherein the calculated dis- tortion is based on the sum of squared differences computed. in step (e). This information can be used to decide whether the encoding mode is suitable or not.\n\nPreferably the method further comprises the step of quan- tizing the coefficients of said transformed residual block F obtain a quantized transformed residual block Z.\n\nPreferably step (d) is carried out with the aid of a look up table.", "type": "Document"}}
