Other biodegradable polymers can be formed\n\npolymeric materials . In an embodiment of the present inven\n\nby the copolymerization process using other lactone mono\n\ntion , the biodegradable metallic material can include mag- 60 mers such as y - butyrolactone ( y - BL ) , d - valerolactone\n\nnesium and / or a magnesium alloy . In another embodiment ,\n\n( N - VL ) , y - valerolactone ( Y - VL ) , and y - caprolactone ( Y - CL ) .\n\nthe biodegradable metallic material can include iron and / or\n\nThe biodegradable polymer can be a polymer or copolymer\n\nan iron alloy . In certain embodiments of the subject inven\n\nof any of these monomers or any combination thereof . The\n\ntion , the biodegradable metallic materials can be beads ,\n\nformation process of the polymer can be either with or\n\n65 without catalysts . In an alternative embodiment , instead of\n\nrods , tubes , or any combination thereof .\n\nWith the hybrid materials of the subject invention , the\n\nchemically synthesizing the polymer from monomers , the\n\nmechanical properties of the materials can be modified so as\n\npolymer may be obtained by purchasing a commercially\n\nUS 10,603,412 B2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nobtain the approximate mechanical properties of natural bones without inducing biological toxicity.\n\nadding the biodegradable metallic material to the polymer melt to form a pre-hybrid material; shearing the pre-hybrid material in a first direction and a second direction; and compressing the pre-hybrid material along a third direction to obtain the hybrid material.", "type": "Document"}}
