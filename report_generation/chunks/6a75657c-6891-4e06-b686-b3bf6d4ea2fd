The feed network 112 is operably connected with the planar dipole antenna 106 and the loop antenna 108 for feeding an electrical signal from the feed source to the planar dipole antenna 106 and the loop antenna 108 so as to form an electric dipole at the planar dipole antenna 106 and a magnetic dipole at the loop antenna 108.\n\n[0038] FIG. 4A is a plan view of a top layer of a planar complementary antenna in one embodiment of the inven- tion;\n\n[0039] FIG. 4B is a plan view of a top layer of a planar complementary antenna in one embodiment of the inven- tion;\n\n[0040] FIG. 5A is a plan view of a top layer of a planar complementary antenna in one embodiment of the inven- tion;\n\n[0057] As shown in FIG. 1C, the planar dipole antenna 106 and the loop antenna 108 are both arranged on the same (bottom 103) side of the substrate 104. The planar dipole antenna 106 and the loop antenna 108 are directly connected with each other, i.e., formed integrally.\n\n[0041] FIG. 5B is a plan view of a bottom layer of a planar complementary antenna in one embodiment of the inven- tion;\n\n[0058] The planar dipole antenna 106 has a first portion and a second portion that are symmetric about an axis X. The first and second portions each includes a first elongate: conductive strip portion 106A, 106C and a second elongated conductive strip portion 106B, 106D generally extending at an angle to the respective first conductive strip portion 106A, 106C. In this embodiment, the first and second elongated conductive strip portions 106A-106D are gener- ally rectangular (or straight), and the angle between them is about 90 degrees.", "type": "Document"}}
