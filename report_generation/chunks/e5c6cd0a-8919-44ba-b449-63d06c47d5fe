Additionally or alternatively, the locking and unlocking processes can be controlled in various manners, such as manually or remotely.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, such as shown in FIG. Sa or FIG. 55, one or more braking elements 50 can be provided. and formed in various manners to adjust the constant correc- tion force. For example, the braking elements 50 can be attached to any portion of the support member 10 or the anchor members 30 to reduce or terminate the correction force applied to correct scoliosis. Exemplary braking ele- ments 50 can include, but are not limited to, wires, threads, hooks, screws, clamps and the like. In an exemplary embodi- ment, one or more braking elements 50 can be in the form a clamp 52, such as a \u201cC\u201d shaped clamp. In another exemplary embodiment, the clamp 52 can be at least partially formed of a superelastic or pseudoelastic material or other materials with the same properties. In a further exemplary embodiment, the braking elements 50 can be the same as the anchor mem- ber 30.\n\nIn one exemplary embodiment, when the superelastic sup- port member 10 restores to its original position after being implanted, the blocking elements 64 can act as a stop mecha- nism to intercept the movement of the support member 10. The blocking elements 64 can instantaneously stop the move- ment of the support member 10 without any manual or remote control means. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the restraining elements 60 are also within the scope of the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
