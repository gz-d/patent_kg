Itis to be appreciated and understood that the various components of the barrier component 500 can communicate information between each other and/or between other components asso- ciated with the barrier component 500 as desired to carry out operations of the barrier component 500. It is to be further appreciated and understood that the communicator compo- nent 502, interface component 504, detector component 506, etc., of the barrier component 500, can each be included within the barrier component 500 (as depicted), can be a stand-alone unit, or can be incorporated within another com- ponent, and/or virtually any suitable combination thereof, as", "type": "Document"}}
