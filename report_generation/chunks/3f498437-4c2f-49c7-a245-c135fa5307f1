In striking contrast to conventional wis- dom, the inventors demonstrate that the previously strictly avoided detrimental crack phenomenon can be translated. into a powerful tool to achieve structures and functions that are otherwise impossible to realize even using state-of-art facilities. The inventors\u2019 innovation lies in that elastomer materials are associated with a high level of configurability by virtue of their elastic deformation characteristics; effec- tively controlling the cracking in elastic materials and sub- sequently configuration of the elastic crack can pave a road for 3D replication. The inventors demonstrated that this approach can realize faithful mass-production of various functional hierarchical structures reported before that could only be made at very small scale in silicon or photoresist only. The inventors name this new approach configurable, elastic crack engineering (CECE)-assisted molding, which is breakthrough in microfabrication technology, as it greatly extends the range of 3D micro-processible materials to broadly used structural plastics and other shapeable mate- rials, as well as tremendously reduced the production cost (by the order of 10\u00b04) and increased the production scope and throughput. The inventors\u2019 work paves the way for the cost-effective, large-scale production of a variety of flexible, inexpensive, and transparent 3D hierarchical and biomi-", "type": "Document"}}
