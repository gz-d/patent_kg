Specifically, wave incident angles can be tuned by mechani- cally tilting a minor placed in front of an f-theta refractive lens or reflector, thereby adjusting the focal position. The use of conventional bulky refractive/reflective components makes these systems unwieldy, slow, and with limited field of view, for example, 1.1\u00b0x1.1\u00b0. The realization of fast, compact, lightweight, and high-repeatability focus-steering devices is one of the most important open challenges in terahertz science.\n\n[0005] Thus, there is a need in the art for focus-steering devices. Such devices could be used in terahertz systems applications such as imaging and tracking.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nrelates\n\ninvention\n\nnovel\n\nThe\n\nto\n\n[0006] present a antenna with a 3D near-field focus-steering capability that operates at gigahertz and terahertz frequencies. The novel antenna includes a pair of discrete dielectric lenses fed by a stationary horn source. In-plane synchronous counter-rota- tion and co-rotation of the lens pair steers its near-field focus radially and azimuthally, respectively, while linear transla- tion of the upper lens moves the focal point longitudinally. The steering focus beam enables fast imaging. In imaging applications, a radiated beam focused in the target area can reduce undesired interference from neighboring structures and increase the system dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nthe\n\ninvention\n\nincludes\n\nfirst\n\n[0007] In one aspect, second rotatable discrete dielectric metalenses, each metal- ens including arrays of subwavelength dielectric projections,\n\nfor\n\nlens\n\nand\n\nDec. 9, 2021", "type": "Document"}}
