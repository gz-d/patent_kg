The photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus 300 can generate three-wave- length laser pulses and the system 200 can accordingly acquire three-wavelength photoacoustic signals in sub-mi- croseconds. The photoacoustic imaging or sensing apparatus 300 may be integrated with the system 300 as a single apparatus. The sample in this example includes a tube T holding a liquid, e.g., blood. The tube T is connected to a syringe X that is in turn connected with a pump P.

The optical processing unit is arranged to receive and process pulsed laser received. from the pulsed laser source 302 to provide laser pulses of different wavelengths. The probe 304 connects with the optical processing unit to receive the laser pulses and to transmit them to the sample.\n\n[0078] As shown in FIG. 2A, the pulsed laser source 302 is a pump laser, more specifically a nanosecond pulsed laser (532 nm, VPFL-G-20, Spectra-Physics). In this embodiment the pulsed laser source 302 is a single wavelength source. The pulse repetition rate of the pump laser can reach up to 1 MHz and the pulse width is set to 7 ns.", "type": "Document"}}
