For example, an absorption/desorption between a gas such as water vapor (H,O), ammonia (NH;) vapor, alcohol, hydro- fluorocarbon (HFC), hydrofluoroolefin (HFO), or CO, and a reagent such as salt, water, 1onic liquid, or other absorbents. The charging and discharging processes are represented by the equation below (diluted solution means a lower fraction of absorbent; concentrated solution means a higher fraction of absorbent):\n\n. charge \u4e00 Diluted + heat Concentrated + Refrigerant solution discharge solution\n\n[0025] In the charging process, the diluted solution is heated by thermal energy and becomes a concentrated solution after some refrigerant is generated (desorption); the thermal energy is stored in the concentrated solution. In the discharging process, the concentrated solution 1s mixed with the refrigerant (absorption) and becomes a diluted solution. The heat release is the useful output if the purpose is heating supply, while the cooling effect caused by the refrigerant evaporation is the useful output if the purpose is cooling supply.", "type": "Document"}}
