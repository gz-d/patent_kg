Asa further example, methodologies can include, converting a portion of the first collected solar radiation (or a second collected solar radiation) into an elec- trical potential available for use by the communications antenna (e.g. GA 300, GA 500, etc.).\n\nIn further non-limiting methodologies 1900, a portion of the electrical potential can be used to operate a portion of the communications antenna (e.g. GA 300, GA 500, etc.). For instance, at 1908, methodologies 1900 can include using a portion of the electrical potential to operate a portion of the communications antenna. As further described above regard- ing FIGS. 3-6 and 17, solar energy collection systems 1700 can comprise an array of circuitry 1708 that can be configured or adapted to electrically couple the one or more solar cell(s)\n\nIn view of the systems, components, and devices described supra, methodologies that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter will be better appreciated. with reference to the flowchart of FIGS. 19-20.
