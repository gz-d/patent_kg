The post-hoc pairwise comparison reveals that the five- module configuration yielded significantly lower accuracy than the three- and the four-module configurations (3 vs 5: 99.1% vs 86.0%, p<0.0005, 4 vs 5: 99.1% vs 86.0%, p<0.0005), with no significant difference between the three- and the four-module configurations (p=0.923). FIG. 6 shows the accuracy of individual stimuli identification, and FIG. 7 shows the confusion tables in different thermoelectric (TEC) configurations.\n\n[0078] Response Time. The multi-factorial repeated mea- sures ANOVA revealed the significant effect of the configu- ration on the participants\u2019 response time to the stimuli (F(2,22)=11.53, p<0.005, 12=0.512). Post-hoc Boferroni test showed that the 5-modules configuration yielded sig- nificantly longer response time than the 3-modules configu- ration (p<0.005) and the 4-modules configuration (p<0.05), and there was no significant difference between the response time for the 3-modules and the 4-modules configurations.
