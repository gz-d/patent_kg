A neurostimulation system comprising\n\n[0108] For the rotarod test, motor coordination was evalu- ated using rotarod apparatus (LE8500, BIOSEB, France). Mice were trained for 3 sessions over 5 days at initial speed of 4 rpm and then progressively increased to accelerated mode for 2 min. Mice that stayed on the rotarod spindle for at least 60 s were selected for the experiment. Baseline of the rotarod test was performed at an accelerated mode (4-40 rpm) for 5 min and the mean latency to fall off (retention time on rotarod spindle) was used for evaluation purposes. Animals were given minimum 15 min to rest between each trial (Au et al., 2016).\n\nan electromyographic (EMG) electrode;\n\nneural electrode implantable in a deep cerebellar nuclei of a subject;\n\na data acquisition unit in communication with the EMG electrode for receiving and transmitting a EMG signal; and\n\nprocessor in communication with the data acquisition unit, the processor generates a EMG pattern based on the EMG signal and outputs a stimulation signal to the neural electrode when the EMG pattern is indicative o. an abnormal motor movement.\n\n[0109] The beam walk test assesses fine motor coordina- tion and balance. Mice were trained to cross a wooden round beam, 100 cm long, 1 cm diameter, and 50 cm above the bench. Time to traverse the beam was determined using ANY-maze video tracking system (ANY-maze, Stoelting, USA).\n\nThe neurostimulation system of claim 1, wherein includes a field-programmable gate array.\n\n3.
