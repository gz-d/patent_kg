Wearable devices require portable power sources such as example batteries. Portable power sources often can suffer from power output capacity for a small footprint. A small portable power source often has a limited output capacity, while large portable power sources have a large enough power output but can be very heavy and are less suitable for wearable devices. Portable power sources can often be fragile and are limited by their size.\n\n[0014] In one configuration flexible substrate is bendable comprises a flexural modulus value such that the flexible substrate can bend or be wrapped around about a limb of human body while maintaining structural integrity.\n\n[0015] In one configuration the flexible substrate com- prises Polyimide or Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Poly- carbonate, Polypropylene, Polyethylene, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC).\n\n[0016] In one configuration the first electrode and the second electrode being coupled to either of the semiconduc- tor elements or the conductor member.", "type": "Document"}}
