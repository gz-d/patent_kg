The sample was cut into two separate pieces with a razor blade and then placed in contact with hands. FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate in-situ microscope photographs of the UP,-C, sample at different time points. FIGS. 4B and 4C show the sample at 20 minutes and 40 minutes, respectively, at 80\u00b0 C. The results show that the self-healing efficiency of the composition increases with time. Heating the composi- tion to 70\u00b0 C. also significantly accelerates the healing process, which correlates with the rheological and DMA analysis showing that the modulus of the composition decreases above this temperature.\n\n[0153] Compared to the control sample UP,-C, (FIG. 7C and FIG. 7F), the composition comprising one or more monomeric units and hydrophobic material, i.e. essential oil in this embodiment, exhibited anti-bacterial ability to gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria. Bactericidal ability of the composition also positively correlated with the content of essential oil in the composition. When FIGS. 7A-7C were compared with FIGS. 7D-7F, samples of the composition at the same concentration appear to have a stronger bacteri- cidal effect on gram-positive bacteria when compared with gram-negative bacteria.\n\nhealing times was also conducted and is illustrated in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6. The healing efficiency of the sample at 40 minutes was 96.5% relative to pristine sample, potentially attributable to the chain motion and dynamic hydrogen bonding association.\n\n[0154] Time Dependent Disinfection Efficiency", "type": "Document"}}
