The major output is from Purkinje cells projecting to the DCN. DCN acts as a relay center to receive inputs from Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and projects to various pre-motor areas for fine tuning of motor activity. Therefore, the neural electrode is preferably implanted in the DCN to achieve the desired modulating effect of the present invention.\n\n[0047] FIG. 6A shows the videokinematic tracing results the control group with reference to EMG pattern.\n\n[0048] FIG. 6B shows the videokinematic tracing results of the DKO group with reference to EMG pattern.\n\n[0049] FIG. 7 is a plot of descent latency of the control group and the DKO group before and after DCN stimulation, determined under the pole climb test.", "type": "Document"}}
