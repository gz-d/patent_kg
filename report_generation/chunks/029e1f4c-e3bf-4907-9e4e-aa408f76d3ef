Amplitude and phase information the learned 2D sparse representation can used to represent the temporal flickering features. A weighted function can be used for balancing amplitude and phase information to improve effectiveness. An integration algorithm can be applied to combine each block of the temporal layers. A weighted pooling algorithm integrates scores from each temporal layer, in which the importance of each temporal layer can be measured and considered. The number of edge patches can be used to rank the importance (which affects the weighting) of each temporal layer.
