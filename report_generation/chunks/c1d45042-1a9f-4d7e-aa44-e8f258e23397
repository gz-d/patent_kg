Since PTFE electret is associated with high charge storage density whose stability can be also preserved by continuous droplet impinging, it serves as a virtual source. When a falling droplet spreads on the PTFE surface, it induces the charge transfer between the ITO source and drain, bridging the originally disconnected terminals into a closed-system, a process reminiscence of the formation of gate channel under the action of gate voltage in the case of FET. The dynamic formation of the gate-like channel in our TIDE-G is also accompanied by the concurrent building of electrical double layers (EDLs) at both terminals that ultimately leads to the preferential charge separation and the directional transport of ions to the respective terminals. From the energy point of view, continuous impinging droplets also serve as soft, configurable transformers that dynamically regulate the effi- cient hydrodynamic-to-electrical energy conversion. Thus, by careful control of the synergistic cooperation among the source/virtual source, drain and gate, it has been shown that continuous and efficient electricity generation is achievable by translating the conventional interfacial effect into a desirable bulk effect from the sustainable source, such as", "type": "Document"}}
