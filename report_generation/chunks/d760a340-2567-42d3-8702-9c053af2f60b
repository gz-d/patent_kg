The manifestation of these special architecture enables the skin of springtail beetles to repel various liquids and dirt, and respire in humid and dirty environment. Another extreme case is exemplified by Nepenthes alata that evolved peristome arrays to offer the spontaneous, diode- like spreading of liquid. The diversity and complexity of structures result in many unexpected combinations of func- tions, allowing biological systems to survive and adapt to the challenges of life.", "type": "Document"}}
