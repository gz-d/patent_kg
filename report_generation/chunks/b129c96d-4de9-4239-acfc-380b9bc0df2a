Amethod of performing plasma based ion implantation comprising:\n\nfeeding a gaseous or vaporized implantation material to an implantation chamber through a feed conduit, and sup- porting a sample to be implanted on a sample holder, said feed conduit having an end that opens into said implantation chamber to form a feed conduit exit open- ing, wherein said end and said feed conduit exit opening formed by said end define a feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, and wherein said sample holder defines a sample holder cross-sectional area situated opposite from said feed conduit exit opening cross-sec- tional area, said feed conduit exit opening cross-sec- tional area being smaller than said sample holder cross sectional area; and\n\napplying a negative potential to said sample holder while maintaining said end at a potential that is positive rela- tive to said sample holder so as to generate an electron focused electric field between said sample holder and said feed conduit exit opening that is effective to gener- ate a glow discharge to create a plasma from said gas- eous or vaporized implantation material, whereby ions from said plasma are accelerated towards said sample for implantation therein.\n\n2. A method according to claim 1 comprising applying negative potential to said sample holder as a series of pulses maintaining said conduit exit opening grounded.\n\ngenerating a glow-discharge between said sample holder and said feed conduit exit opening by applying a nega- tive potential to said sample holder to generate a plasma from said gaseous or vaporized implantation material, whereby ions of said implantation material are gener- ated and accelerated towards said sample.\n\n3. A method according to claim 1 comprising maintaining the pressure in said implantation chamber above a breakdown pressure and high enough to maintain a steady-state glow discharge.", "type": "Document"}}
