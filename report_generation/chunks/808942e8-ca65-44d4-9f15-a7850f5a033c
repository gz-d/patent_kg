Power adaptors (or AC-DC power converters) are traditionally used to charge the batteries in the electronic equipment. Due to the wide range of portable electronic prod- ucts, many people nowadays have a wide range of power adaptors because there is no standard for charging different types of portable electronic equipment.\n\nRecently, a number of types of planar inductive charging platforms have been proposed. One example is described in GB2399225A which generates an AC electromagnetic flux 1 with the flux lines flowing \u201chorizontally\u201d along the charging surface 2 as shown in FIG. 1A. A distributed winding is used in this charging platform for generating the AC flux. This principle is in fact similar to the AC electromagnetic flux generated in a cylindrical motor, except that the cylindrical structure is compressed into a flat pancake shape. As the flux needs to flow horizontally along the upper and lower surfaces, two inherent limitations arise.\n\nFirstly, an electromagnetic flux guide must be used to guide the fiux along the bottom surface. This is usually a layer of soft magnetic material such as ferrite or amorphous alloy. In order to provide sufficient flux, this layer must be \u201cthick\u201d enough so that the flux can flow along the layer of soft mag- netic material without magnetic saturation. Secondly, a simi- jar problem applies to the secondary device that has to pick up to flux (and energy) on the upper surface of the charging platform.", "type": "Document"}}
