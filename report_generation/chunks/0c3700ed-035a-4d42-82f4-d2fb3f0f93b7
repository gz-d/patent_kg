Weighted Pooling for Temporal Layers\n\n[0116] This embodiment employs the same method to assess spatial activity distortion as that in X. Liu, Y. Zhang, S. Hu, S. Kwong, C. C. J. Kuo and Q. Peng, \u201cSubjective and objective video quality assessment of 3D synthesized views with texture/depth compression distortion,\u201d\u201d IEEE Trans. Image Process., vol. 24, no. 12, pp. 4847-4861, December 2015, which mainly measures the variance difference of the pixel gradients in a spatiotemporal tube. The concept of Quality Assessment Group of Pictures (QA-GoP) and Spa- tial-temporal (S-T) tube are introduced in the spatial-tem- poral activity distortion measurement method, which is illustrated in FIG. 9. A video is divided into several QA- GoPs, which is made up of a number of frames, e.g., 2N+1 frames as shown in FIG. 9. A QA-GoP consists of multiple S-T tubes, which are concatenated by matched blocks via motion estimation algorithms in adjacent frames and denote the motion trajectory. Given the original video V, and. distorted synthesized video V first of all, the pixel gradi- ents G,S(x,y,t), and G(x,y,t), are computed by calculating the norm of the pixel gradient vector composed of horizontal and vertical spatial gradients at frame t, respectively.", "type": "Document"}}
