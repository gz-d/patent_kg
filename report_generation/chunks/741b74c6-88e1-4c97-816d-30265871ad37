In one approach, foreign protective layers (e.g., carbon, polymer, inorganic oxides and so on) are used as coatings. These coating layers require an additional coating process, and their homogeneity and completeness remain a chal- lenge. More importantly, the diverging dynamic behaviors of host lattice and coating layer also leads to cracks and even separation upon long-term cycling, which fails to protect the bulk materials. Further, coatings cannot efficiently mitigate the underlying structural transitions and thus the internal stress in the primary grains, especially in view of the fact that they are generally accomplished at a secondary-particle scale. Thus, there is a need in the art for improved Ni-rich NCM material design down to the primary-grain level to overcome the above deficiencies.\n\nApr. 14, 2022\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION,\n\n[0005] The present invention provides a facile PGE approach to engineer a Ni-rich NCM cathode material down to primary-grain level. By fine tuning the local electronic structure to induce the Jahn-Teller octahedral distortion, monoclinic grain boundaries are built within the hexagonal primary grains, which significantly improved the cycling stability and rate capability of the cathode material. Advan- tageous over other methods, the cathode material involves minimum alterations of structure, constituents, and mor- phology, which ensures industrial applicability without tradeoffs regarding to energy density and battery safety.", "type": "Document"}}
