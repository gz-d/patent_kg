The parameters for Na* and Cl\u201d were taken from previous studies\u00ae (a,,,=2.876 A, sw=0.5216 kJ/mol, 0,,=3.785 A, \u20ac\u00a27=0.5216 kJ/mol). The cross LJ interaction parameters between water and sodium and chlorine ions were given by Lorentz-Berthelot rule. The interactions between substrate atoms and NaCl water solution were described by 12-6 LJ potential (Gaw\u3002 sp=3.021 \u4ece\uff0cews sp-=0.4785 kKi/mol, og, sub=3.476 A, \u20acey 560.4785 kJ/mol\uff0cao so-3.458 A, \u20ac 0.567 0-6223 kJ/mol). Fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald method was used for electrostatic interactions with a real- space cutoff 10 A. The van der Waals interactions were truncated at 10 A. Newton\u2019s equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 1 fs by leap-frog algorithm in the MD simulations. Nos\u00e9-Hoover scheme was used to control constant temperature of the systems. All the MD simulations were carried out by using Gromacs 4.5.5 soft- ware.\n\n[0074] Materials. Acetone (RCI Labscan, 99.5%), ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 97%), nitric acid (Sigma Aldrich, 70%), Polytetrafluoroethylene precursor (Dupont AF 60182, 6 wt %), polydimethylsiloxane (Dow Corning\u00ae SYLGARD, PDMS 184) were used without further purification.", "type": "Document"}}
