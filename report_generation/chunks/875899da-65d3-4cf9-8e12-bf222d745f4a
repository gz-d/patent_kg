The secondary energy-receiving cir- cuits of all electronic loads are designed to pick up the flux at the same frequency. This ensures that the secondary circuits are compatible with the charging pad.\n\nFIG. 4 is a schematic of a full-bridge power inverter with a primary winding and a DC-blocking capacitor,\n\nFIG. 5 is a schematic of a half-bridge power inverter with a primary winding and a DC-blocking capacitor,\n\nSince the magnetic flux is a function of the excitation current in the windings of an active group, the power inverter that drives the windings in the charging pad should be current controlled.\n\nFIG. 6 shows a typical winding array in a planar battery charging platform,\n\nFIG. 7 shows an AC-DC voltage-mode controlled first- stage flyback converter feeding a constant current source to a second-stage full-bridge fixed frequency inverter,\n\n(5) In order to control the power delivered to the inverter and hence the windings of the active group, the front-stage power converter should have a controllable output voltage. Since the second-stage power inverter is controlled to inject a constant AC current into the windings of the active group, the control of the output voltage of the first-stage power converter can be used to control the power of the active group.\n\nFIG. 8 shows an AC-DC current-mode controlled first- flyback converter feeding a constant current source to second-stage full-bridge fixed frequency inverter,\n\nFIG. 9 shows an AC-DC voltage-mode controlled first- boost converter feeding a constant current source to second-stage full-bridge fixed frequency inverter,", "type": "Document"}}
