At its most basic form, the audio processing separates the frequency spectrum into bands corresponding to the number of active electrodes, each handling slightly overlapping frequency ranges. The temporal envelope of the incoming signal in each frequency band is estimated and a train of electrical pulses of corresponding amplitude is delivered to the corresponding electrode in an interleaved sampling.\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE\n\nA portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material, which is subject to copyright protection.

However, such stimulation strategy encodes very little details of harmonic structure cues and temporal fine structure cues for musical pitch and timbre.\n\nDue to technological and user-specific (e.g., biological) limitations, the perception of musical features is diminished in Cls users (individuals with CIs).\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention generally relates to method of processing audio signals and an audio processing system, and more particularly, to methods of processing audio sig- nals and audio processing system for a cochlear implant.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
