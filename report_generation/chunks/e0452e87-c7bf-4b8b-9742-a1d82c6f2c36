In other words, the present invention is\n\napplicable on a polymer film prepared by a polymer solution comprising PVDF and/or TPU. Although the mixed solvent illustrated in embodiments 1-16 is DMF-water in embodi- ments 1-3, 6-11, 14-16, and DMF-ethanol in embodiments 4 and 12, it shall be understood that solvents suitable for preparing the mixed solvent according to the present inven- tion is selected from a group consisting of DMF, water, ethanol, dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and in combination thereof. It shall be understood that any solvent or mixed. solvent that can semi-dissolve or partially dissolve the electrospun film falls into the scope of the present invention. For sake of brevity, examples of solvent or mixed solvent are not described herein. Further, it shall also be understood that the mixed solvent prepared according to the present inven- tion is suitable for the prepared electrospun film according to the present invention comprising PVDF and/or TPU. For sake of brevity, embodiments above do not illustrate all possibilities. It shall be understood that every specific numerical point for parameter described in embodiments in this context (for example: mixing ratio between solvents, solubility of solvent to polymer, solubility of polymer in solvent, contact angle of mixed solvent on electrospun film, ot-pressing temperature in post-treatment, pressure in post- treatment, etc.) can be used as an end point for a numerical range for said parameter in embodiments according to the resent invention. In other words, said end point is included in the numerical range. It shall also be understood that every numerical value in said numerical range can be an end point for another numerical range for said parameter in embodi-\n\nments according to the present invention.", "type": "Document"}}
