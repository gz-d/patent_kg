Referring to FIG. 15, spe- cifically, in the step $510: A data set in response to the movement event is measured by, the receiving electrode portions RP.\n\nIn the step $520, the movement event is classified through the classification ML model by analyzing the data set in response to the movement event, so as to determine if the movement event is a negative event or a positive event. A sliding window operation and a channel-wise gradient operation, which are similar to the steps $340, $350, are performed on the data set, and the descriptions are not repeated herein. Thus, a feature set including feature vectors in response to the movement event is determined. The processor P compares the feature set in response to the movement event and the negative feature set in to\n\nof\n\n25\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n65\n\nIn some embodiments, the data set in response to the movement event is analyzed/processed by the processor P by performing the steps similar to the steps S420, S430 to obtain an estimate result of continuous 1D tracking of the thumb\u2019s position on the index through the second ML regression model ML2.\n\nBased\n\nabove,\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nof the\n\nembodiments", "type": "Document"}}
