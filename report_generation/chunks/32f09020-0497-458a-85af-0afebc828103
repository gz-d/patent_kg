The scene capture devices 802 through 814 can be associated (e.g., communi- catively connected via a wired or wireless communication connection) with the capture component 702 of FIG. 7, and the capture component 702 can receive the respective subsets of video information relating to the real 3-D scene from the respective scene capture devices 802 through 814.", "type": "Document"}}
