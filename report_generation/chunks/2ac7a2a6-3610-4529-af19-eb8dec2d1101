The array of primary windings may also be divided into a plurality of zones and within each zone the primary windings are of identical size and shape, though different zones may feature windings of different sizes and shapes.\n\nThe data transfer from the primary side to the secondary side may be achieved by modulating the excitation of a pri- mary winding. The data transfer from the secondary side to the primary side may be achieved by modulating a parameter (such as, for example, the loading conditions) on the second- ary side.\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the primary wind- ings are provided in a stacked structure which may, for example, be formed of two or more connected coils separated a substrate.\n\nPreferably, only a single primary winding is excited when secondary winding is placed on the charging surface.\n\nPreferably, the data communication comprises detection the primary side of a load to be charged on the secondary side. The detection of a load to be charged may include detection of the location of the load on the charging surface.\n\nIn embodiments of the invention, the electromagnetic shielding provided with the secondary winding extends beyond the dimensions of the secondary winding. Preferably, only a primary winding that is covered either by the second- ary winding, or by the electromagnetic shielding, when a secondary winding is placed on the charging surface is excited. More than one primary winding may be excited, provided that only primary windings covered by the second- ary winding and/or shielding are excited.", "type": "Document"}}
