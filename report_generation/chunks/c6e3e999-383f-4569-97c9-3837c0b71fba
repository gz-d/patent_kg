Unlike in GB2399225A, GB2389720A uses a multi-layer planar winding array to generate an AC flux 4 that has almost uniform magnitude over the entire charging surface 5. The lines of flux of this charging platform flow \"perpendicularly\" in and out of the charging surface as shown in Fig.2. This perpen- dicular flow of flux is very beneficial because it allows energy transfer over the surface on which the electronic equipment (to be charged) is placed. [0007] For both planar charging platforms described above, it is necessary to use an electromagnetic shield 6 on the bottom surface. If the charging platform is placed on a metallic desk, the AC flux generated in the charging platform may induce currents in the metallic desk, result- ing in incorrect energy transfer and even heating effects in the metallic desk. US patent 6,501,364 has been shown to be an effective electromagnetic shield for this type of planar charging platform. The electromagnetic shield in US6,501,364 simply consists of a thin layer of soft magnetic material (such as ferrite) and a thin layer of conductive material (such as copper).
