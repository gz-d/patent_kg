Color of light has a direct relation with the wavelength of the electromagnetic (EM) wave, for example, in the visible light spectrum, red light generally refers to EM wave with wavelength close to the spectrum at around 650 nm, whereas blue/violet light generally refers to the 400 nm end.\n\n[0018] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the color coding system further comprises a color manipulation mod- ule arranged to manipulate the numerical codes so as determine one or more target colors associated with one more baseline colors in the color space.\n\n[0019] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the color manipulation module is arranged to determine one or more relationships among multiple colors in the color space.\n\n[0003] A color may also be specified based on attributes such as hue, saturation, brightness or a combination of basic colors in a color representation or color space. In an example color representation, a color may be represented by a coor- dinate of a point on a color graph. Alternatively, a color may be specified based on intensity or \u201camount\u201d of each of the basic colors in a color space which combine to form such a color.\n\n[0020] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the one more relationships include a complementary relationship, and wherein m colors are complementary colors if a,+0.,+ \u00bb. +0,,\u2014B +84... +B,,-0)4+0,+ ... +0,, for all the colors p,\u201c\"'ps*\"p3\u00b0\", pi*paP?ps, . - . , pa*\u201d\"pa?\u201d\"p3\u00b0\u201d.\n\n[0021] In an embodiment of the first aspect, the one more relationships include a monochromatic relationship between the target color and the baseline color,", "type": "Document"}}
