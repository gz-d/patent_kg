For example, the barrier control component can moni- tor or scan the control region of a projector screen of a pro- jector screen component during presentation of the video image (e.g., normal 2-D video image or enhanced 2-D visual image) displayed on the projector screen, and can detect the signal (e.g., optical signal) in the control region, wherein the signal can be one of a plurality of available signals that can be respectively associated with corresponding display modes and/or corresponding barrier pattern modes or barrier pat- terns associated with the barrier component.\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment of the disclosed sub- ject matter, one or more of the systems, the devices, the barrier control component, and/or other components disclosed. herein, can be or can comprise one or more electronic circuits situated or implemented ona single integrated-circuit chip. In accordance with another embodiment, one or more of the systems, the devices, the barrier control component, and/or other components disclosed herein, can be or can comprise one or more electronic circuits implemented on an applica- tion-specific integrated-circuit (ASIC) chip. In yet another embodiment, one or more of the systems, the devices, the barrier control component, and/or other components dis- closed herein, can be or can comprise one or more electronic circuits situated or implemented on multiple dies or chips.", "type": "Document"}}
