Description of Related Art\n\n[0003] In a 3D integrated circuit (3D IC), conventional solder joint technology typically relies on the solid-liquid interdiffusion (SLID) reaction, in which the solder alloy is in the liquid state and the Cu substrate is in the solid state. To enable the SLID reaction, the reaction temperature must be above the melting point of the solder alloy. However, since the melting point of the solder alloys (e.g., Sn\u2014Ag alloy) is typically above 200\u00b0 C., and the soldering temperature is even higher, thus, conventional soldering is basically in- operable at room temperature.\n\nOn the other\n\nthe size of interconnected\n\n[0004] hand, as components in 3D ICs continues to shrink, there are several challenges that must be addressed in order to make reliable solder joints in micron ranges. One of the major challenges is the difficulty in preparing uniform small solder particles. Current methods for preparing such particles, including high-energy ball milling, mechanical crushing, centrifugal atomization, chemical reduction, and laser processing, have limitations in terms of cost, uniformity, and impurity control. These limitations make it challenging to create stable sub- micron-sized solder particles required for micro-bumps. Another challenge is to control the shape of the liquid solder phase during reflow, which can lead to the protrusion of the solder layer in micro-bumps and limit the yield during\n\nassembly.\n\n[0005] To overcome these challenges, ultrasonic vibration (USV) is developed for the preparation of small and uniform solder particles, therefore can be used to form spherical nanoparticles of low-melting metals. However, only a lim- ited number of studies have focused on developing multi- alloy solder particles and their practical applications. Despite these efforts, no substantial progress has been made in this area.", "type": "Document"}}
