The system includes one or more processors arranged to perform any of the methods of the first aspect. In particular, the one or more processors are arranged to: process a reference video file and a synthesized video file associated with the reference video file to compare the reference video file and the synthesized video file; and determine an extent of flicker distortion of the synthesized video file based on the processing. The synthesized video file may be a 3D video file containing 3D video data, or it may be a virtual reality video file containing virtual reality video data.\n\n[0043] FIG. 6C is a gradient feature map corresponding temporal layer of FIG. 6B, along with zoomed-in views the rectangles marked on the temporal layer;\n\n[0044] FIG. 6D is a video frame of a synthesized video corresponding to the original video of FIG. 6A,\n\n[0045] FIG. 6E is temporal layer generated by the hori- zontal line in FIG. 6D, along with zoomed-in views of rectangles marked on the temporal layer;", "type": "Document"}}
