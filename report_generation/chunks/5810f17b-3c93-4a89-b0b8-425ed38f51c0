The aim was to discover differences in the high-level cognitive behavior involving the explorative and preference-biased periods. For each group, representative exploration-period and preference-biased-period HMMs were computed running the VHEM algorithm on the exploration-period and preference-biased-period HMMs of that group respectively\u2019. It was then examined how participants in the two groups differed decision making behavior, including their differences in the gaze cascade plot/effect, transition between the exploration and preference-biased periods, distribution of number fixations in exploration/preference-biased periods, and accuracy of inferring preference\n\nin\n\nby\n\nof\n\nchoices from eye movement data.\n\nEXAMPLE 10\u2014Transition between exploration and preference-biased periods\n\nAfter participants\u2019 high-level transition matrices were clustered into two groups, it\n\nwas further investigated how the participants in these two groups differed in decision-making behavior. More specifically, the probability that the participant was in the preference-biased period was investigated from the beginning to the end of a trial. For each trial, the posterior probabilities of all possible high-level state sequences were computed given the observed eye gaze data. Then a sequence of probabilities of being ln the preference-biased period was computed by computing the expectation over the high-level state sequences, 7.e., by computing the weighted average over all high-level state sequences where the weights are the posterior probabilities. This was performed on all trials in all participants. Since the duration\n\n' Since forced", "type": "Document"}}
