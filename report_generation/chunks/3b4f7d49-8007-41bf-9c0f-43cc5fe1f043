The measured maximum realized gain is\n\nabsorbing or dissipating the energy through a filter ( esp . ,\n\n7.28 dBi at 5.8 GHz , which is 0.78 dB lower than the\n\nresistor ) . The energy in the passband is transmitted to the\n\nsimulated peak gain ( 8.06 dBi ) at 5.94 GHz due to experi\n\nantenna , whereas the energy in the stopbands is absorbed by\n\nmental tolerances . The measured realized antenna gain is\n\nthe filter ( esp . , resistor ) . As a result , the energy reflection is\n\nhigher than 7 dBi from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz , with a measured\n\ngreatly reduced or even eliminated in both the passband and\n\n1 - dB gain bandwidth ( gain 6.28 dBi ) of 5.86 % ( 5.63-5.97\n\nstopbands , which avoid possible detrimental effects on the\n\nGHz ) .
