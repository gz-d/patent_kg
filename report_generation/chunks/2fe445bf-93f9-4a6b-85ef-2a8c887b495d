In a further embodiment, the modification method can be ther- mal treatment. Depending on the biodegradable metallic material(s) used, the thermal treatment can allow formation of an oxide layer on the metallic surface. In yet a further embodiment, both plasma immersion ion implantation and thermal treatment can be performed. A change in surface chemistry can enhance the bonding or adhesion between the biodegradable metallic material(s) and a biodegradable polymeric substrate.\n\nThe novel hybrid materials of the subject invention pro- vide a stable degradation rate for the whole material since the polymer and metallic material are distributed approxi- mately evenly. Additionally, strong bonds (e.g., chemica\u2019 bonds) can form between the metallic material and the polymer. For example, a coupling agent can be used to modify the metallic material so that chemical bond can be formed with the polymer, thereby improving the mechanica. properties of the hybrid material.", "type": "Document"}}
