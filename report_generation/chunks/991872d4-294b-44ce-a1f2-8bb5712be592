In particular, the mixture may be a slurry obtained by mixing the COF, the conductive material, the binder, and a solvent (e.g., NMP). The slurry may then be pasted onto the current collector to form an assembly, which may be subsequently dried. Pref- erably, the mass ratio of the COF, the conductive material, and the binder in the slurry is about 7:2:1 to about 3:6:1. The step of drying may be performed in a vacuum oven at about 30\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C., about 50\u00b0 C. to about 130\u00b0 C., or about 60\u00b0 C. to about 120\u00b0 C., for about 3 h to about 48 h, about 5 h to about 36 h, or about 6 h to about 24 h.", "type": "Document"}}
