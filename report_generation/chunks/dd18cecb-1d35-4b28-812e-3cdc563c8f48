In some examples, the semiconductor elements may be semiconductor diodes, such as PIN diodes. In some examples, the semiconductor elements of the same control arrangement in a subwave- length unit may be arranged (e.g., controlled by the control- ler 10) to operate simultaneously in either the ON state or the OFF state. In some embodiments, the semiconductor ele- ments of the same control arrangement in a subwavelength unit are biased in the same bias state (e.g., a forward-biased. state, a non-biased state, etc.). In some embodiments, each of the control elements may be respectively connected across a slot portion of its corresponding slot. For example, each slot may include two control elements each connected across a respective slot portion of the slot. The two slot be arranged on opposite long sides of the slot\n\nportions may\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\nshaped as a loop. In some embodiments, for each subwave- length unit, the two control elements of one of the slots is disposed generally along an axis (which, in some examples, is generally perpendicular to the axis along with the corre- sponding slot extends), and the two control elements of another one of the slots is disposed generally along another axis (which, in some examples, is generally perpendicular to the axis along with the corresponding slot extends) that is at an angle (e.g., acute angle, right angle, etc.) to the axis. In one example, the angle is about 90 degrees.", "type": "Document"}}
