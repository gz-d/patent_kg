It can be understood that this mode can be caused by the L-probe, for example, because its frequency agrees reason- ably with 2.25 GHz estimated using a primitive formula of f=c/[4(L,,+L,)]. where c is the speed of light in vacuum. The discrepancy between the two frequencies can be further understood by noting the fact that the primitive formula does not take into account the effect of the suspended patch. According to various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, exemplary GAs can employ the first resonant mode (e.g., resonance caused by the TM), mode of the exemplary single-element 102 SPA).\n\nThus, according to various implementations, the GA 700 can comprise a parabolic reflector 702 (e.g., a substantially parabolic reflector comprised of a metallic reflector, etc.) antenna fed by an exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna) that can be supported by holder or support 710. Inan aspect, GA 700 can further comprise one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704. In addition, one or more conformal overlaid solar cell(s) 704 can be fabricated, placed on, or otherwise attached to the parabolic reflector 702 antenna and. under a coating or overlay 802 that permits transmission of light but reflects one or more of Radio Frequency (RF), microwave, or millimeter-wave signals to exemplary antenna 706 (e.g., a horn antenna).\n\nFIG. 11 depicts measured antenna gain 1102 as a function of frequency 1104 for an exemplary non-limiting single-ele- ment 102 SPA. It can be seen from FIG. 11 that the gain is approximately 7 Decibel Isotropic (dBi) around the SPA mode, as expected for the dominant TM mode of the exem- plary non-limiting single-element 102 SPA.", "type": "Document"}}
