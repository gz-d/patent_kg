The composition of claim 1, wherein R has a structure Formula (Ia):\n\n[0161] The release of the carvacrol encapsulated into the composition was also investigated in water, as shown in FIG. 8D. The cumulative release of carvacrol from the composition samples could last for up to 60 days, demon- strating controlled or sustained release properties of carvac- rol when encapsulated into the composition samples. This may be attributed to the strong noncovalent interactions between carvacrol oil and the one or more monomeric units. Thus, the composition of the present invention shows strong prolonged release behavior this providing a highly advan- tageous composition with wide applicability, such as in the preparation of sustained release dosage forms for various medical purposes.\n\nFormula (Ia) Ri Ro \u201c co) * Rs Ry\n\nin which:\n\nR, and R, are independently selected from the group consisting of (i) a linear or branched alkyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkenyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom: a linear or branched alkynyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (ii) a cycloalkyl group optionally comprising a heteroatom; (iii) an aryl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; and.
