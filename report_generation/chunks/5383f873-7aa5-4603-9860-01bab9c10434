Copious amount of recipes for tailoring metal surface at nanoscale level have been experimentally developed. However, they ubiquitously suffer from either poor structural uniformity or high cost and tedious procedure, which severely restrict their practical application. As a result, current commercial noble metal products generally display poor surface roughness at the macroscopic sale, leading to unsatisfactory device per- formances.\n\n[0015] In one aspect of the present invention, the solution the electrolyte includes an acid.\n\n[0016] In one aspect of the present invention, the acid includes at least one of nitric acid and citric acid.\n\n[0017] In one aspect of the present invention, the solution the electrolyte further includes an additive for manipu- the size and morphology of the nanoparticles.\n\n[0018] In one aspect of the present invention, the additive includes at least one of acid, metal salts, water soluble polymer, citrate sodium, polystyrene sulfonate, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and cysteine.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
