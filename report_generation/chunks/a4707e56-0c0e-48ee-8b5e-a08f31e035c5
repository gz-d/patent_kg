The ratio of the polymer to the metallic materials can be varied. For example, 50%-99.9% polymer can be used, and 50%- 0.1% metallic materials can be used. Table 7 shows an example of process conditions for solvent formation using PCL and magnesium beads. All values listed will work with slight variations, such that each value should be interpreted as having the word \u201cabout\u201d in front of it.\n\nExample 8: 150 hm Magnesium Beads\n\nMagnesium a um were to fabricate an embodiment of the hybrid material of the subject invention. The polymer used was PCL. Tables 8 and 9 show the process conditions used. Table 8 is with no pre-heat treatment, and Table 9 is with pre-heat treatment. All values listed will work with slight variations, such that each value should be interpreted as having the word \u201cabout\u201d in front of it. Additionally, FIG. 3 shows the compressive modulus for the resulting hybrid materials (\u201c_ASCA\u201d indi- cates no pre-heat treatment, and \u201c_pre&ASCA\u201d indicates pre-heat treatment; the amount of Mg is in grams). FIG. 5 shows fluorescent photos after 1 day and after 3 days using enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein Osteoblasts (eGFPOB) culture by incorporating 0.1 g ASCA-treated 150 hm mag- nesium beads as an example. The photos suggest that the hybrid material of the subject invention is compatible with the growth of osteoblasts.\n\nTABLE 7\n\nProcess conditions for solvent formation Solvents used Dichloromethane (Weight of PCL/Volume of DCM: 0.05 g/ml-1 g/ml)\u2019 Trichloromethane (Weight of PCL/Volume of TCM: 0.05 gmLl g/ml) 1 g of PCL 0.1 g to 1 g magnesium beads 30 mins to 1 hr 12-24 hrs 60\u00b0 C.-80\u00b0 C, 30 mins to 3 hrs Polymer added Metallic materials added Sonication time Drying duration Heat treatment temperature Heat treatment time\n\nTABLE 8", "type": "Document"}}
