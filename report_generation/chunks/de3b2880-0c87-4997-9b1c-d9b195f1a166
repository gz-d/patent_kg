Under similar surface charges, the TIDE-G devices made of PDMS and PP exhibit comparable initial output to that of TIDE-G made of PTFE. However, distinct from the latter, the output in both devices made of PP and PDMS exhibits a rapid decay, partly due to the relatively poor charge stability.\n\n[0064] A second aspect is concerned with behavior of continuous droplet impinging serving as a facile method to induce high charge density on PTFE. PTEE has been found. to be a promising electret material with high charge storage capability and stability. As shown in FIG. lc and FIG. 1, there is a gradual increase in the surface charge with the progression in the times of droplet impinging. Experiments leading to the present invention have shown that the PTFE surface can serve as a rich charge reservoir to electrostati-\n\n[0059] FIG. 17 is a graph showing thickness of PTFE film a function of volume of PTFE precursor.
