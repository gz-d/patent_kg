Preferably, the groove generally elongates in a first direc- tion, and the dielectric block further includes an opening continuous with the groove and generally extends in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. Prefer- ably, the opening is continuous with the groove in a central portion of the groove. Preferably, the second excitation member comprises a L-probe arranged at least partly in the opening. The antenna may further include an air-filled metallic cable arranged in the opening and generally coaxi- ally with a portion of the L-probe in the opening. The antenna may further include a suppressor for suppressing cross polar fields generally by the L-probe. The suppression may include an arc-shaped sleeve attached to the air-filled metallic cable. Optionally, the arc-shaped sleeve is semicir-\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0006] It is an object of the invention to address the above needs, to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages or, more generally, to provide an antenna, in particular a multi- (e.g., dual-) frequency antenna that is compact, light, and operationally-effective in supporting 4G, 5G, or any other future wireless communication standards.\n\n[0016] Preferably, the dielectric resonator antenna is microwave dielectric resonator antenna and the Fabry-Perot resonator antenna is a millimeter wave Fabry-Perot resona- antenna.", "type": "Document"}}
