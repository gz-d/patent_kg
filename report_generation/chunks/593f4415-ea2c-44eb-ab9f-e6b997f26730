The contribution from the elongation of tension bars 18a is rela- tively small at large displacement. This is illustrated by the measured deformation of the plastic hinge 20 of Example 3 as shown in FIG. 8. The compression shortening of the mecha- nism 50 was directly measured in the test. The elongation of the bars was obtained from the measured strain of the rein- forcement bars 18a at mid-span multiplied by the plastic hinge length 55 of 200 mm. The figure shows that the defor- mation of GFRP bars 18a was greater than that of the com- pression mechanism 50 before yielding. The compression deformation increased quickly and linearly after the yielding point whereas the tension deformation of the plastic hinge 20 essentially kept unchanged. The compression deformation was almost ten times that of the tensile deformation at the maximum mid-span displacement of 82 mm. FIG. 9 shows the variation of the compression shortening of the mechanism\n\nMander, J. B., Priestley, M. J. N. and Park, R.
