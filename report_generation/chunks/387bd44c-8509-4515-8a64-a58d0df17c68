The main components of the information handling system 700 are a processor 702 and a memory unit 704. The processor 702 may be formed by one or more of: CPU, MCU, controllers, logic circuits, Raspberry Pi chip, digital signal processor (DSP), application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), Field- Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), or any other digital or analog circuitry configured to interpret and/or to execute program instructions and/or to process data. The memory unit 704 may include one or more volatile memory unit (such as RAM, DRAM, SRAM), one or more non-volatile unit (such as ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FRAM, MRAM, FLASH, SSD, NAND, and NVDIMM), or any of their combinations. Preferably, the information handling system 700 further includes one or more input devices 706 such as a keyboard, a mouse, a stylus, an image scanner, a microphone, a tactile input device (e.g., touch sensitive screen), and an image/video input device (e.g., camera). The information handling system 700 may further include one or more output devices 708 such as one or more displays (e.g., monitor), speakers, disk drives, headphones, earphones, printers, 3D printers, etc. The display may include a LCD display, LED/OLED display, other suitable display\n\nthat may\n\na\n\nor any or may not be touch sensitive.
