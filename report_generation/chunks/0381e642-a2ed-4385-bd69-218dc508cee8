The compensator circuit 222 is arranged to generate a compensa- tion signal I,,,,,, based on said difference level signal and to apply said compensation signal I,,,,,,, to said inductor 226. In this example, the compensation signal is provided by a linear- type current source 228 of the compensator circuit 222 con- nected to an output of the inductor 226. Application of the compensation signal to the inductor 226 results in a compen- sated output current signal i,. The compensation signal I.,,,,,, is an inverse waveform signal of the output current signal i, minus the reference signal I,,-namely:\n\nThe first and second examples also provide a power supply embodying means for implementing said method.", "type": "Document"}}
