These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the inno- vation may be employed and the disclosed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and distinctive features of the disclosed subject matter will become apparent from the following detailed description of the innovation when considered in conjunction with the drawings.\n\nIn an embodiment, a multi-phase system can comprise a multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) synchronous rectifier that can be employed to receive and synchronously rectify a multi- phase signal (e.g., multi-phase AC power signal) and produce a desired signal (e.g., rectified DC power signal) as an output. The multi-phase synchronous rectifier can comprise, for example, six (or more) switches (e.g., MOSFET switches), which can be power switches that can facilitate synchro- nously rectifying the multi-phase power signal. In an embodi- ment, the six (or more) switches can be situated in relation to each other to form and/or emulate a diode bridge.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example system that can synchronously rectify a received signal (e.g., power signal) in accordance with various embodiments and aspects.\n\nFIG. 2 depicts a diagram of an example system that can synchronously rectify a received signal (e.g., power signal) accordance with various embodiments and aspects.\n\nIn an aspect, the multi-phase system can comprise an SDGD subsystem that can be associated with the power switches, and can be designed such that the SDGD subsystem\n\nFIGS. 3A through 31 illustrate diagrams of operation, in relation to time, of an example system comprising the high-\n\n220 V mains) and/or high frequency applications.\n\n25\n\n40\n\n45\n\na\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
