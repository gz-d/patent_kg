The follow- ing now describes the design of the oscillator at a high fundamental frequency of 225 GHz, considering the para- sitic capacitance of transistor.\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\n[0181] As mentioned above, both high fundamental ampli- tude harmonic at the transistor gate by driving the transistor into the cut-off region and high fundamental amplitude at the transistor drain by driving the transistor into the triode region can simultaneously boost third harmonic current output. A higher net fundamental output power of the transistor can sustain a stronger oscillation fundamental amplitude in an oscillator. In some examples, the phase difference of fundamental voltage gain between the gate and drain deviates from 180\u00b0 to compensate for the direct current feedthrough to improve the fundamental oscillation ampli- tude at a high fundamental oscillation frequency.\n\n[0182] FIG. 10 shows an example simulation setup for determining fundamental operation condition and harmonic load impedance (fundamental frequency set to 225 GHz). Specifically, the simulation setup in FIG. 10 can be used to determine the optimum fundamental voltage gain phase difference and corresponding net fundamental output power Po_fo.\n\n[0183] FIG. 11A shows simulated net fundamental output power Po_f, for different fundamental voltage gain phase differences \u00bb. As shown in FIG. 11A, in this example, phase difference of about 160\u00b0 can maximize Po_f, for higher fundamental oscillation amplitude.\n\na\n\na\n\n[0184] In one example, driving the transistor into and triode region can cancel the second harmonic current, relieving the potential adverse effect of the second harmonic voltage induced at the drain yet without shortening simplifying circuit design.\n\ncut-off\n\nit,", "type": "Document"}}
