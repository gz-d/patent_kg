It plays a critical role in regulating cell metabolism. Klip is reported to occur on several essential metabolic multimeric complexes, including the branched-chain a-ketoacid dehy- drogenase complex (BCKDH), the a-ketoglutarate dehydro- genase complex (KDH), the pyruvate dehydrogenase com- plex (PDH), and the glycine cleavage complex (GCV). Klip is required as an essential cofactor for maintaining the activity of these enzyme complexes. Malfunction of the lipoylated metabolic complexes, on the other hand, can lead diseases. For loss of PDH\n\n[0071] A series of competition experiments was per- formed to further identify the high-specificity binders of\n\nto\n\nof\n\nis\n\na\n\nin\n\ncells\n\n[0065]\n\nPost-translational modifications (PTMs) of lysine\n\nattracted increasing attention in recent years.\n\nto numerous\n\ninstance,\n\nlipoylation\n\nhas\n\ndis-\n\n(FIG. 15) was\n\nalso synsthesised.\n\n[0070]\n\nUsing the two probes (KPlip and KPlip-C).
