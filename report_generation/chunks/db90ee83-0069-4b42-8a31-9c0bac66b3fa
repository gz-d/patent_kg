The use of the pro\n\nmeans for connecting said battery charging circuit to an exter\n\nposed inductive charging device is simple and comprises only\n\n30\n\nnal power adaptor, and said device further comprising an\n\na thin sheet of soft magnetic material, a winding, a small AC\n\nenergy receiving element adapted to receive power from a\n\ncapacitor, a diode rectifier and a DC capacitor (and an\n\nplanar inductive charging system and for Supplying power to\n\noptional Voltage regulator). The invention is particularly use\n\nsaid battery charging circuit, said energy receiving element\n\nful for use with any charging platform (such as that shown in\n\nhaving an inductance, and an capacitor connected to said\n\nWO03/105308 but not limited thereto) that provides mag\n\n35\n\nenergy receiving element and forming a resonant tank there\n\nnetic flux perpendicular to the charging Surface, the entire\n\nwith, wherein said energy receiving element comprising a\n\narea of the proposed device can be used to pickup the AC flux.\n\ngenerally planar thin soft magnetic sheet located on a side of\n\nFor the same reason, the structure of the proposed device can\n\nsaid battery pack facing a side of said housing adapted to be\n\nbe of low-profile (i.e. very thin, less than 1 mm), making it\n\nreceived on a said planar inductive charging system and a first\n\neasy to mount the proposed planar device on the active side of\n\n40\n\ncoil wound circumferentially around the edge of said sheet\n\nthe battery inside a battery pack without increasing the overall\n\nSuch that the coil lies in a plane defined by said magnetic\n\nthickness of the battery pack substantially.
