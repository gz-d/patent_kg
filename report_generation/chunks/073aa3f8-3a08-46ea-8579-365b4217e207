The XIST-L1/L2/L3 genome browser view on XIST hairpin structure information by Lu et al. uses black strings to represent regions with comple- mentary pairs. The vertical lines in different colors highlight the location of the different gRNA groups of the targeted locus on the XIST IncRNA. The locations of known domains (A-H) are also indicated.\n\n[0069] FIGS. 6a to 6\u00a2 show the CARPID results of XIST, wherein:\n\n[0070] FIG. 6a shows the use of the Venn diagram to illustrate the overlap/repeatability of the CARPID mass spectrometry identification results of three different XIST gRNAs (XIST-L1/XIST-L2/XIST-L3).\n\n[0071] FIG. 66 shows the use of the Venn diagram illustrate the overlap of the proteins significantly enriched the CARPID mass spectrometry identification results three different groups of XIST gRNA (XIST-L1/XIST-L2/ XIST-L3).\n\n[0072] FIG. 6c shows the identification of XIST binding proteins using CARPID. The volcano plot shows the enrich- ment of XIST-related proteins in HEK293T cells. The x-axis represents the log 2 converted value of the protein level fold change in the CARPID results of all three groups of XIST gRNAs compared with the control. The y-axis shows the negative logarithmic converted p-value (non-parametric rank product test). Significantly enriched proteins are marked with orange dots. Proteins previously known to interact with XIST and recognized by CARPID are marked. in orange font. The blue font represents SNF2L and TAF15,\n\nwhich are two newly identified XIST-related proteins.", "type": "Document"}}
