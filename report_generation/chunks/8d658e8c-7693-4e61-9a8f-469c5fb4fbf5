Transform Domain Sum Squared Difference\n\ninverse quantized-transformed residual block. Equation 14 shows that the cause of the SSD is due to the quantization errors in the DCT transformed residual block F. The reason behind this is that the quantization is applied to the trans- formed coefficients of F. That is why SAD(S,P) and SATD (S,P) cannot well predict the SSD(S,C). Both SAD(S,P) and SATD(S,P) are determined by the original block and pre- dicted block, without considering the influence of quantiza- tion which the inventors have determined is the real reason of the SSD. For example, ifthe quantization step=18 and all the transform coefficients are multiples of 18, then the quantize: coefficients would be the same as the inverse quantized coef-\n\nIn this section, we analyze the major cause of the SSD (sum of squared differences) between the original block and recon- structed block in the rate-distortion cost function. One method of calculating the rate-distortion cost (Jap) for video and image encoding schemes, such as MPEG-like or H.264/ AVC schemes, can be summarized as:\n\nCompute the predicted block using inter or intra frame prediction: P\n\nUsing the original block S and the predicted block P to compute the residual (difference) block: D=S-P\n\nDiscrete Cosine Transform (DCT) the residual block:\n\n(BQUATION 9)\n\nF=DCTD)=TpcPT pcr\"\n\n180 72 36 18 72 54 18 36 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 0 and the quanization step is 18, then\n\nwhere Tp\u00a27 is the DCT matrix which is a unitary matrix T,.7\u2019 is the transported matrix of Ther.", "type": "Document"}}
