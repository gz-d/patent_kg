Please see FIG. 12, wherein We=pDv7/y, where D, v and y are the diameter, impact velocity and surface tension of the droplet, respectively. As shown in FIG. 3d, the charge is linearly proportional to We: as the We increases from 27.6 to 130.9 by varying the releasing height, the transferred charges increase from 21.9 nC to 68 nC. In contrast, without the use of a transistor-like design, the measured charges on TENG are negligible and insensitive to We or the maximum spreading area, A,,,,,.~We. Also, there is no notable difference in the charges measured from the droplets departing from TIDE-G and TENG. Please see FIG. 11.
