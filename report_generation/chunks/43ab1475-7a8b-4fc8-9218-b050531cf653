To resolve the values of the nuclear modulus E,,,iexs and the cytoplasmic modulus E.,,., a simplified physical cell structure consisting of only the\n\n(6)\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\ncytoplasm 306 and the nucleus 308 is adopted to represent the key biomechanical properties of the captured whole cell 302.\n\n[0079] The whole cell elasticity measured under the large cell deformation can then be considered as the nucleus and the cytoplasmic body being compressed simultaneously inside the microfluidic channel 304. In other words, the \u2018modulus jump\u2019 is attributed to the nuclear deformation.\n\n[0080] According to the force balance as shown in FIGS. and 3B, the compressive force is related to the drag force the following equation:\n\n3A by\n\nF azag OF compress! Sin 6 (8)\n\n[0081 Foonpress Can be calculated by multiplying the driv- ing pressure P with the normalized compressive force (de- noted as F*) at 1 kPa as described previously in FIG. 2B. As the penetration length L can be converted to W goyorms F* is a function of D and Wuprm Hence, Equation (4) can be rewritten as:\n\ncompress =PXE*(D, W teform)-K\\D.W efor) ED, We form) (9)\n\nF\n\nwhere K is a function of D and Worm\n\n[0082] The compressive force driven by the inlet pressure is distributed into two smaller compressive forces applied on the cytoplasm 306 and nucleus 308. Therefore, considering compressive forces Fi and F, are caused by the driving pressures of P,=100 Pa and P,=400 Pa, respectively, the compressive forces Fi and F, can be calculated with the following equations:\n\nPEP XE * Dects WK Deets WE cototK Daetouse WE \u2018nucteus (10)", "type": "Document"}}
