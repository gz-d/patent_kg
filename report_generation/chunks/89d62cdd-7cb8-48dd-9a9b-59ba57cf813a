First, to examine the percentage of\n\nfixations in a trial required for making above-chance-level inferences, the first 10% of the fixations were used for the inferences and this proportion was increased by 5% each time until all fixations (100%) were used. The inference task was therefore conducted 19 times, and the mean inference accuracy was calculated each time. Second, to examine how quickly a decision could be inferred, inference on increasing duration of fixation sequences was performed from the beginning of the trial (e.g., the fixations In the first 1 second, the fixations the first 2 seconds, etc.). Third, the gaze cascade model suggested that although preferences were shaped during a trial when participants switched their fixations between the two stimuli, the fixations immediately before the end of the trial were usually significantly biased to the preferred stimulus. Thus, these fixations should be better predictors for participants\u2019 preference than the earlier fixations. Accordingly, in a separate examination only the fixations in the last 2 seconds before the decision were used to perform the\n\nin\n\ninferences.\n\nEXAMPLE 12\u2014Categorization of individual SHMMs\n\nOne SHMM was trained for each participant and 1) a standard HMM using the exploration period transition matrix to represent the participant\u2019s eye movement pattern during the exploration period and 2) a standard HMM using the preference-biased period transition matrix to represent the participant\u2019s eye movement pattern during the preference- biased period were created.\n\nTable 2 below shows the average high-level state transition matrix. Participants started in the exploration period, and had a 55% probability to remain in the exploration period. Otherwise there was 45% probability to transition to the preference-biased period, and remained there until the end of the trial.\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n3]", "type": "Document"}}
