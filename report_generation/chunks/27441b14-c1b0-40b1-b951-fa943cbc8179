Under current-control mode, the first-stage power converter feeds a DC current to the second-stage power inverter. In both operating modes, the objective is to maintain a constant current feeding the second-stage power inverter. That is, under voltage-control mode, the power converter will vary its output voltage (Vdc) in order to keep constant the current feeding the second-stage inverter. Under the current- control mode, the power converter is controlled to provide a current of a desired value to the second-stage inverter.\n\nThe current feeding the second-stage power inverter is monitored by a current sensor which can be a small resistor or a hall-effect current sensor. If the power absorbed by the secondary load increases (decreases), this current may be reduced (increased). A feedback current is compared with a preset reference (Vref) that represents the desired current feeding the primary winding, which can be set by users, or according to some standard or to flux, power or other require- ments communicated back from the load. The error signal is then amplified by amplifier A and compared by a comparator C with a triangular carrier reference of a fixed frequency that determines the switching frequency of the first-stage power converter. The duty cycle will be dynamically adjusted to control the DC-link voltage (Vdc) so as to keep the current feeding the second-stage inverter to the desired current value within a small tolerance.\n\nThe same principle can be implemented using a boost converter as the first-stage under voltage-control mode current-control mode as shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, respec- tively.", "type": "Document"}}
