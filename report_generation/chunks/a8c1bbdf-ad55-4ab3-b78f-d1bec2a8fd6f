In this embodiment, the coupler 402C is an even-mode-shorted coupler (such as that described with reference to FIG. 2) for enabling or sustaining an out-of-phase coupling mode between the two oscillators. The gate terminals of the transistors of both transistor arrangements 402A, 402B of the two oscillators are all electrically connected with the even-mode-shorted coupler (and other even-mode-shorted coupler(s) connected with adjacent unit cell(s), if any).\n\n[0159] In this embodiment, the source terminal of one of the transistors (e.g., the upper one in FIG. 4A) may be electrically connected with an odd-mode-shorted coupler (such as that described with reference to FIG. 2) for enabling or sustaining an in-phase coupling mode between itself and an adjacent oscillator in an adjacent unit cell, and/or the source terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) may be electrically connected with an odd-mode-shorted coupler (such as that described with reference to FIG. 2) for enabling or sustaining an in-phase coupling mode between itself and an adjacent oscillator in an adjacent unit cell.\n\n[0160] Inthis embodiment, the patch antenna arrangement of the unit cell 400 includes two patch elements 404A, 404B with generally identical shape and size and construction (but arranged at different positions). Each of the patch elements 404A, 404B is respectively coupled with both oscillators. Each of the patch elements 404A, 404B may respectively be part of a larger patch (e.g., combined with the patch elements of adjacent unit cells, e.g., see FIG. 15).", "type": "Document"}}
