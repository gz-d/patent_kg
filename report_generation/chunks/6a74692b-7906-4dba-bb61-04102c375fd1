The voltage vz... can begin to decrease from volt- age V,, which can indicate that the transistor Q, is turned to an off state and the transistor Q, can be switched to an on state. While at ornear time t,, the voltage vz. can reach the voltage Ya and can be clamped to the voltage of the capacitor Ca by the p-n junction between the base and collector of the tran- sistor Q,.\n\nIn an aspect, current sensing resistors, Rs (e.g., 2.0 mQ) and Rg, (e.g., 2.0 m2), and the respective comparators CP, and CP, can be respectively associated with switch 206 and switch 208, wherein the resistors, R,, andR,.. and the respec- tive comparators CP, and CP, can be used to detect the cur- rents in the respective switches 206 and 208, and can drive the respective switches 206 and 208. In an embodiment, if desired, respective on-state resistors (not shown) of the respective switches 206 and 208 also can be used to replace the sensing resistors, Rs and Rs,, respectively, in SDGD 216 and SDGD 218.\n\nFIG. 3F presents operation of the system 300 during the time period of time to to time ts, because the voltage level V,-V, is a positive value, the input voltage v,,, can commutate atornear time ty, which can occur after time ty. At or near time to, the source drain diode of the switch 202 can begin in an off state and the source drain diode of the switch 204 can begin to conduct naturally, for example, as illustrated in FIG. 3F. The time interval to to time ts can end, for instance, when the voltage vaca drops down in voltage level to the defined threshold switching voltage for the switch M, to switch to an on state.", "type": "Document"}}
