On the other hand, the ultrashort reduction step 104 prohibits overgrowth of silver nuclei, which facilitates the formation of uniform and densely packed Ag nanosphere films 20. Naturally, the resultant morphologies are tailorable by modulating the oxidation and reduction steps 102 and 104 respectively.\n\n[0058] In one exemplary configuration, the electrochemi- cal treatment of the metallic structure 10 may be performed in an electrochemical cell having a working electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte in electrical connection. Optionally, the electrochemical cell may also include a reference electrode, which serves for voltage measurement purpose. A metallic structure 10 made of a first metallic material is used as working electrode and a wire made of a second metallic material is connected to the counter elec- trode respectively. The solution of the electrolyte is an acid and preferably a diluted acid solution such as nitric acid or citric acid.\n\n[0065] Advantageously, the dimensions and density of Ag nanosphere 22, i.e., the morphology at the surface 20 of the SAN 10, can be precisely controlled in the range from ~100 to 600 nm as depicted in FIG. lc through altering the electrochemical parameters (e.g., P,, Ps, t, and t,). Four SEM images of nanosphere 22 with different dimensions are depicted in FIG. 1c, with scale bars indicate 2 hm and 500 nm for the low and high magnification images respectively.", "type": "Document"}}
