In particu- lar the flexural member may comprise concrete, for example FRP bar or steel bar reinforced concrete, such as a concrete structural member such as a beam or column.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nIt is known that when large flexural deformation occurs in a structural member (hereafter referred to as a \u201cflexural mem- ber\u201d), the plastic deformation is mainly concentrated in a small area called the \u201cplastic hinge\u201d zone that has a limited length. When large rotations of the plastic hinge cannot be achieved through elongation or tensile yielding of the rein- forcement on the tension side, the other way to achieve it is by shortening or compression yielding on the opposite compres- sion side.\n\nPreferably the mechanism is made from steel or other metallic materials, FRP, composite, plastic, cementitious material, elastomeric material or combinations thereof, mechanism may be encased in a protective material a lightweight concrete or other low strength materials.", "type": "Document"}}
