To demonstrate the wide dynamic range of the present application, an experiment using the dielectric/ metal/dielectric SPR sensing structure has been conducted. A triangular prism made of BK7 glass is employed. In the conventional SRR configuration, the transducing layer of the sensing surface is made of conducting material such as gold. In this case, a gold thin layer, nominally 48 nm thick, is employed because of its good chemical resistance. The target samples are sodium chloride solutions. The concentrations of these solutions are from 0% to 12% (from curve 801 to curve 807 in FIG. 8) by weight with 2% increment, the correspond- ing refractive index unit (MU) ranged from 1.3330 to 1.3541. As seen from these plots, the system covers a dynamic range of 2x10-? MU with spectral range covering 600 nm to 800", "type": "Document"}}
