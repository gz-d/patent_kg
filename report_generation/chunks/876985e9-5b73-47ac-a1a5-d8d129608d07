FIG. 6B illustrates a bar graph showing the live cell percentage in the recollected cells and the control group of FIG. 6A.\n\nTo examine cell viability after the nuclear elasticity\n\n[0098]\n\nquantification procedure, cell live/dead assay is performed on recollected cells after the procedure and cells in a control group (e.g. cells that are not injected into the microfluidic channel). The LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit is applied to examine the cell viability (see description about \u201ccell viabil- ity test\u201d below in the \u201csupplementary information\u201d section or further details). For examining cell viability on recol- lected cells after the quantification procedure, a tube is connected to the microfluidic device outlet to collect cells, ollowed by mixing the prepared LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit in the recollected cells. Similarly, LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Kit is mixed in trypsinized cell suspensions to stain cells in the control group. From the cell viability staining results shown in FIG. 6A, it is noted that only few dead cells are found for both recollected cells and the control group. From the bar graph shown in FIG. 6B, it is noted that high ive cell percentage is maintained after the proposed quan-\n\ntification procedure.
