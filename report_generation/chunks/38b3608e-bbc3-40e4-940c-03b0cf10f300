The solar energy collection system of claim 9, the selective transmission layer comprises a grid of at least one metal, a metal wire, or a metallic composition.\n\n11. The solar energy collection system of claim 10, the grid is further configured, relative to predetermined wavelengths of the incident solar radiation and the reflected communica- tions signal, with a grid spacing adapted to at least one of aid reflection of the incident RF signal, the incident microwave signal, or the incident millimeter-wave signal or aid transmis- sion of the incident solar radiation.\n\nWhat is claimed is:\n\n1. A solar energy collection antenna comprising:\n\nareflector structure adapted to support at least one confor- mal solar cell adjacent to the reflector structure;\n\na selective transmission layer adjacent to the at least one conformal solar cell on a side of the at least one confor- mal solar cell opposite the reflector structure, the selec- tive transmission layer adapted to transmit at least a portion of incident solar radiation to the at least one conformal solar cell, the selective transmission layer further adapted to reflect at least a portion of at least one of incident Radio Frequency (RF) signals, incident microwave signals, or incident millimeter-wave signals creating reflected communications signals; and\n\n12. The solar energy collection system of claim 8, communications antenna is further configured as a horn antenna.\n\n13. The solar energy collection system of claim 12, non-planar reflector structure is further configured as sub- stantially parabolic reflector structure.\n\n14. The solar energy collection system of claim 13, at least portion of the horn antenna located proximate to a focus associated with the substantially parabolic reflector structure.\n\nacommunications antenna located proximate to the reflec- tor structure and adapted to collect at least a portion of the reflected communications signals.", "type": "Document"}}
