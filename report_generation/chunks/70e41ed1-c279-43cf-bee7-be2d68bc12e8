The main difference between this embodiment and the embodi- ment of FIGS. 6B and 6C are that the feeding point of the antenna (the location of the via) has changed.\n\n[0062] In operation, the signal from the feed source is transmitted to the portions 106B, 108A1 through the input portion 112A. Also, part of the signal would couple to a slot \u2018ormed between portions 108A1 and 108E. The signal in the slot would be coupled to the second conductive strip 112B. The signal flow direction in the second conductive strip 112B is opposite to signal flow direction in the first con- ductive strip 112A so the signals have a 180 degrees phase difference. Then, the signal will be transmitted to portions\n\n[0070] FIGS. 8A to 8D show different embodiments of bottom layers 803A-803D of the antenna.
