This element is a component of the element 115 in FIG. 1. The processed structured data 307 is from the structured data pre-processing process 300, the processed textual data 405 is from the textual data pre-processing process 400, and the processed image data is from the image data pre-processing process 500. Element 901 is a combination filter configured to screen out the samples having one of structured data, textual data, and image data. All the data passing through the filter element 901 are mixed data 902, where the structured data, image data, and textual data are filtered structured data 903, filtered image data 904, and filtered textual data 905, respectively. The filtered structured data is to pass through the machine learning and deep learning pipelines. The data is first divided into training set 906, validation set 907 and testing set 908. The training set 906 and the validation set 907 are used to train various machine learning and deep learning models, and then the testing set 908 is added for model\n\n30\n\nverification 916. Finally, the trained machine learning and deep learning models are\n\nDocket No. UM1104HK00 15\n\nHK 30057394 A\n\nobtained and saved into element 921.
