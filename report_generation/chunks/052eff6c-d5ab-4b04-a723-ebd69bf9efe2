For instance, the barrier component 108 can be placed on a front side of the projector screen component 102, wherein the front side of the projector screen component 102 is a side of the projector screen component 102 on which a viewer(s) can view video content.\n\nA signal can be one of a plurality of available signals, wherein respective signals can correspond to respective types of multi-dimensional video content and/or respective types of display modes and/or respective types of barrier pattern modes or barrier patterns. For example, there can be a first signal that can correspond (e.g., be mapped to) normal 2-D content, a second signal that can correspond to a first type of 3-D content (e.g., 3-D stereoscopic content, wherein the pre- sented video content can be one type of enhanced 2-D content that can be processed or converted to produce the 3-D stereo- scopic content), or a third signal that can correspond to a disparate type of 3-D content (e.g., 3-D autostereoscopic", "type": "Document"}}
