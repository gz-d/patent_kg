The switches may be controlled by a microproces- sor control unit and the matrix switching array preferably includes filter means to prevent the generation of EMI inter- ference.\n\nnetic shielding on the side of the winding opposite from the side to be placed on the charging surface. The relative dimen- sions of the primary windings and the secondary winding are chosen to meet the conditions that (a) the area enclosed by the secondary winding is greater than the area enclosed by a primary winding, (b) the secondary winding or the shielding will always fully enclose a primary winding when a second- ary winding is placed on the charging surface, and (c) a single primary winding generates sufficient power to charge a the battery.\n\nAccording to a still further aspect of the invention, there is provided a planar battery charging system comprising a pri- mary power transmission side formed of an array of primary windings adapted to generate magnetic flux substantially per- pendicular to a charging surface, and a secondary power receiving side comprising a secondary winding associated with a battery to be charged and being adapted to receive the magnetic flux when placed on the charging surface. The bat- tery charging system further comprises data communication means for enabling data communication between the primary side and the secondary side.", "type": "Document"}}
