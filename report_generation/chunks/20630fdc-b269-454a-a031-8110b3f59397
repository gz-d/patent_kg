The timebase was 20 us with v,,=2V/div, Veomp 900 mV/div and 1,=2 A/div.\n\nAs already indicated, the voltage regulator 110 is modified include nodes A to E for connection to respective nodes compensator circuit.\n\nThe power conversion stage (PCS) 116 of the regulator of FIGS. 11a to 1le comprises a switching device 142 in the orm ofa transistor, a diode 123, filter inductor 119 and a filter capacitor 118. Vi 112 is the source and ZL, 120 is the load impedance. Pins 8 and 11 of the controller integrated circuit TL494 107 provide the gate signal to the switching element 142 through the resistive network comprising RX and RY. An error amplifier provided by pins 15 and 16 of the IC circuit device 107 is inhibited by connecting pin 15 to the reference voltage Vref and pin 16 to ground. Only an error amplifier formed by pins 1 and 2 is used.\n\nIn FIG. 14, the load resistance was changed from 3Q 10Q, the settling time was also reduced from 8 ms to 600 and the overshoot was reduced from 520 mV to 120 mV with compensator. The timebase was 20 hs with v,,,=2 V/div, Veomp=500 mV/div and i,=2 A/div.\n\nFinally, as shown in FIGS. 12 to 14, v,,,,,,,, Was kept at very low voltage, except during the transient moment. The required power was very low, which is 0.25 W in this example. The waveforms of v,., with and without the com- pensator are almost the same, confirming the foregoing analy- Sis.", "type": "Document"}}
