Similar to the previous hidden Markov modeling approach to eye movement data analysis EMHMM, the EMSHMM approach has several advantages over traditional eye movement data analysis methods such as ROI or fixation heat map analysis, including the ability to account for individual differences In both spatial and temporal dimensions of eye movements (1.e., through discovering personalized ROIs and transition probabilities among the ROIs) and to quantitatively assess these differences. In contrast to EMHMM, which uses a single regular HMM to model eye movements and assumes a participant\u2019s strategy is consistent throughout a trial, the EMSHMM_\u00a7 approach uses multiple low-level HMMs corresponding to different strategies/cognitive states, and a higher-level state sequence to capture the transitions among different strategies/cognitive states. Thus, it is especially suitable for analyzing eye movement data in complex tasks that involve cognitive state changes such as decision-\n\nmaking tasks.\n\nEMSHMM approach,\n\ndemonstrate the advantages of using the\n\npreference\n\nTo\n\na", "type": "Document"}}
