Together these results suggest the possibility of using eye tracking as a screening assessment for cognitive decline or deficits.\n\nEMHMM has been limited to tasks involving stimuli with the same feature layout so that discovered ROIs correspond to the same features across stimuli. For tasks where stimuli have different layouts, the inclusion of perceived images as features in the ROI representations has been proposed but, while this method has improved discovery of ROIs, it does not work well when features among stimuli differ significantly, such as in scene perception.\n\n10 EXAMPLE 3- Novel EMHMM with co-clustering\n\nThe instant invention provides a\n\nnew\n\nmethod that models each participant\u2019s eye\n\n] >\n\n20", "type": "Document"}}
