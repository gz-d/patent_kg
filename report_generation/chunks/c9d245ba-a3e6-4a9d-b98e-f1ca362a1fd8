In particular, the presodiation process may be enabled by way of an electrochemical process such as a discharging process. In an example embodiment, the as-formed anode 32' may be fabricated with a cathode to form a half cell, such as the half coin cell 20'. The half coin cell may then be arranged to undergo a discharging process at a current density of about 40 mA g\u2122! to about 60 mA g7', about 45 mA g7/ to about 60 mA gl about 45 mA gl to about 58 mA gt, about 48 mA g\u2122 to about 58 mA g\u2122, about 48 mA gm to about 55 mA g\u2122', about 48 mA g\u2122! to about 52 mA g\u2122', about 50 mA gr to about 52 mA g\"', or particularly about 50 mA g\"!. The discharging process may be performed for a duration from about 9 hours to about 11 hours, from about 9 to about 11.5 hours, from about 9.5 to about 11 hours, from\n\nabout 9.5 to about 10.5 hours, or in particular, about 10\n\nUS 2024/0079591 Al\n\nhours. After the discharging process, the presodiated anode may be isolated from the half-cell under an inert environ- ment, such as in a glovebox supplied with inert gas (e.g., argon).\n\n[0067] In an alternative or additional embodiment, the presodiation process may be performed by way of, for example, direct contacting the anode 32' with sodium metal or presodiation reagents (e.g., sodium naphthaline, sodium phenyl, etc.). For example, the anode 32' may be pressed with a sodium metal foil, or dispersed with sodium powder or presodiation reagents, or ball milling the COF with sodium metal upon the fabrication of anode 32\u2019, etc.\n\nIn one embodiment, the preparation of the\n\n[0068]", "type": "Document"}}
