For the pressure sensing tests, conductive Cu tapes are adhered onto two electrodes of the interdigital electrode of electronic fabric, and the electronic fabric is encapsulated by the medical grade adhesive tape on the top side to ensure to ft skin. Firstly, the electromechanical properties of electronic skin are measured by monitoring the relative resistance variation or sensitivity (AI/I,, AI=I-L,, L, indicates the original current, I represents the current under pressure). FIG. 3A shows the schematic diagram of the sensing elements, and the inset is the picture of real product with the size of 1.6x1.6 cm\u201d. An interdigital Au electrode is sputtered on the PAN nanofibrous membrane to contact the MXene/CNTs sensing layer and collect the electric signal (FIG. 14). FIG. 3B shows the sensitivity curve of the electronic skin with different MXene/CNT contents under wide range of pressure. The sample-3 is observed to have the highest sensitivity value in comparison with the others, which can be ascribed to the uniformly distributed MXene/ CNTs sensing layer. The sample-1 and sample-2 show lower sensitivity in comparison with sample-3, which can be attributed to the uneven spraying of MXene/CNTs on the C-PVDF nanofibers matrix and thus, larger interface resis- tance and poor ohmic contact between the conductive sens- ing layer and interdigital electrode, resulting in low sensi- tivity. The sensitivity curve can be split into three parts: S1 exists in the low-pressure area (0-3.20 kPa), S2 lies in the middle-pressure area (3.20-6.30 kPa), and S3 lies in the high-pressure area (6.30-20.0 kPa). The corresponding sen- sitivity of S1, $2, and $3 is 237.1, 548.09, and 75.7 kPa\u2019, respectively. In the low-pressure range, the current response and sensitivity of the electronic skin are relatively lower than the sensitivity at the medium-pressure range, which is due to the small air gap between the interdigital electrode and the conductive MXene/CNTs layer and", "type": "Document"}}
