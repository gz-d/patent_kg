For simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are depicted and described as a series of acts. It is to be understood and appre- ciated that the subject disclosure is not limited by the acts illustrated and/or by the order of acts, for example acts can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement the methodolo- gies in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In addi- tion, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the methodologies could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events.\n\nThe subject specification can employ a SDSR (e.g., self- driven multi-phase AC-DC synchronous rectifier) that can be employed to replace a diode bridge as a general-purpose multi-phase AC-DC rectifier. Similar to the single-phase SDSR disclosed herein, the high-side portion and low-side portion (SDGD subsystem) of the multi-phase SDSR can efficiently (e.g., with regard to reduced cost, relative ease of implementation, improved power loss reduction, etc.) pro- vide the normal rectification functions for resistive, capaci-\n\nFor an inductive-resistive load connected to a three-phase system comprising the SDSR (e.g., system 2100), the input voltage and current are substantially the same as that of the resistive load. A larger inductor typically only causes the fluctuation of the input current to be smaller, which does not affect the function of the driver. So the driving signals for an inductive-resistive load are the same, or at least substantially the same, as the driving signals with a resistive load.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 8,913,409 B2\n\n29\n\n30\n\nReferring to FIG. 34, an example methodology 3400 for", "type": "Document"}}
