The electromagnetic device 402 includes a magnetic core 4022, while the electromag- netic device 404 includes a magnetic core 4042. Each of the magnetic cores 4022, 4042 can be movable towards or away from the workspace 40, thereby modifying the boundary of the workspace 40. In this way, the size and location (such as the center of workspace) can be tailored to various industrial contexts.\n\n[0064] As illustrated, a magnetic bridge 480 connects the electromagnetic devices 402, 404. The magnetic bridge 480 includes a first section 482, a second section 484, and a middle section 486 disposed between the first section 482 and the second section 484. The magnetic bridge 480 is such configured that one end (such as the second end) of the magnetic core 4022 passes through the first section 482 and. one end (such as the second end) of the magnetic core 4042 passes through the second section 484. The first, second, and middle sections may be formed separately and then are assembled to form the magnetic bridge. Alternatively, the first, second, and middle sections may be formed integrally as a single piece.\n\n[0065] By way of example, the third section 486 has a surface 4862 opposite to the workspace 40. The surface 4862 as illustrated is of a rectangular shape with a length 1 and a width t. The length | extends along a direction from the second end of the magnetic core of the first electromagnetic device 402 towards the second end of the magnetic core of the second electromagnetic device 404. The length | is in a range from 50 cm to 60 cm, and the width t is in a range from 35 cm to 45 cm.", "type": "Document"}}
