In FIG. 5A, the electronic fabric is used to gather gait information and biomechanical energy based on the single-electrode triboelectric sensing mechanism during running exercise, which is simply pasted onto the internal sole of the running shoe. Distinct signal patterns generated when the volunteer is walking at different paces, which can be acquired by analyzing the frequency and amplitude of the obtained signals easily (FIG. 5B). The V,,. signal of running (1 Hz frequency) is approximately two times higher than the generated signal of walking (0.5 Hz frequency). Addition- ally, the walking pace can be resolved into three sections from the one-step signal in FIG. SB (ie., a. stomping, b. intermission, c. lifting and striding). Two inverse V,,,. peaks can be observed in stage a and stage c, indicating the imposed pressure by feet during walking. The intermission can be applied to demonstrate the walking pace. The stage b disappears when the feet frequency reached 1 Hz, indi- cating fast running. The walking information is of great value to physicians and coaches in the physical therapy of patients with lower extremity disorders and scheduling training sessions for athletes. In addition, the electronic fabric can achieve the accurate physiological monitoring of weak bio-signal based on the piezoresistive pressure sens- ing. The electronic fabric exhibits clear and steady signals of various degree of joint motions (FIG. 18) and displays a high sensitivity for articular nimbleness monitoring. FIG. 19 shows the 7 cycles of breathing signal in 18 s, which is consistent with the normal adult breathing frequency of 16-24 cycles in one minute. FIG. 5C shows the electronic fabric attached onto the volunteer\u2019s throat to monitor the tiny movement of vocalization. The electronic fabric pro- duces apparent signal patterns for different word vocaliza- tion, i.e., \u201chello\u201d \u201cspeaking\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d and \u201csensor,\u201d demon- strating the potential application in AI and voice", "type": "Document"}}
