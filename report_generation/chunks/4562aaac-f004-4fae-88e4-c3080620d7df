Differences between group strategies are subsequently quantified using symmetric KL (SKL) divergence between group HMMs. Correlations between eye movement patterns and recognition performance and/or cognitive abilities are determined by quantifying the similarities of a subject\u2019s pattern the group strategies using a cluster score where log-likelihoods of a subject\u2019s data under different group strategies are employed. For example, individuals\u2019 eye gazes across images are clustered into two groups using the data mining technique co-clustering resulting two group HMMs for each image. Histograms of SKL divergence between the two general pattern groups are generated, where SKL quantifies the difference between the two group\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nin\n\npatterns for each\n\nstimulus.
