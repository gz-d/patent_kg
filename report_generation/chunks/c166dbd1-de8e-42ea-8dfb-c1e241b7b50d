It is located on the Jong (q) arm of the X chromosome in the human genome and. is only expressed in the inactive X chromosome (Xi) to regulate cis-XCI in differentiated female cells. Technical research has revealed a variety of XIST binding proteins in the art and gradually revealed potential molecular pathways. This example focuses on XIST to evaluate the performance of CARPID.\n\n[0103] HEK293T cells are transfected with a vector expressing BASU-dCasRx and three different gRNAs tar- geting different regions of XIST in the present invention (FIG. 14; see Table 1 for the three groups of gRNA).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nXIST Li-1 TGAAAAGACCTTGAAAACACCTGGTGTACC (SEQ ID No. 1)\n\nXIST L1-2 AGGAGGGGACAAATAAGAGGGGACAGAGGT (SEQ No. 2)\n\nXIST L2-1 TATGTGGAGAGGACCCTCCTTTTCTAGTGC (SEQ ID No. 3)\n\nXIST L2-2 AGTCTTATGGAGTGGGCACTCCCTGCTGGA (SEQ ID No. 4)\n\nXIST L3-1 AGTAGAGGGGTTCATGTATAATGGGTGGGA (SEQ No. 5)\n\nXIST L3-2 AGAAGGGGCTTTGGGTAGTCAGCATACTCA (SEQ No. 6)\n\nDANCR L1-1 TAAGAGACGAACTCCTGGAGCTCAAGGTCG (SEQ ID No. 7}\n\nDANCR L1-2 GCTGCCTCAGTTCTTAGCGCAGGTTGACAA (SEQ No. 8}\n\nDANCR L2-1 TTCCTATTGTAACTGAAGGGATAGTTGGCT (SEQ No. 9)\n\nDANCR L2-2 CCAAATATGCGTACTAACTTGTAGCAACCA (SEQ ID No. 10)\n\nID\n\nID\n\nID\n\nID\n\nID\n\nNov. 4, 2021\n\nTABLE 1-continued\n\nMALAT1 L1-1 AGTTGCGGGGCCCCAGTCCTTTACAGAAGT (SEQ ID No. 11) MALAT1 L1-2 TICTGCGTTGCTAAAATGGCGCTGCGCTTA (SEQ ID No. 12) MALAT1 L2-1 AATCTTAGAAACGTGAAAACCCACTCTTGG (SEQ ID No. 13) MALAT1 L2-2 TTGCTTTTTTGTTCGAGAAATCGGAGCAGC (SEQ ID No. 14)\n\n[0104] \u2018The specificity of these gRNA groups is confirmed co-transfection with active CasRx, the CasRx co-trans- fection shows that the target area is specifically digested without affecting other areas (FIG. 4e). Due to the highly ordered structure of XIST, the present invention also avoids targeting the expected XRNA hairpin structure (FIG. 5).\n\nby", "type": "Document"}}
