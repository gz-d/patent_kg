It delivers high cycling stability with reversible capacities of ~340 and 270 mAh g\u2122' at the current densities of 20 mA g 1 and 50 mA gl, respectively (FIGS. 11A-11B). No obvious drop can be observed after 40 charging/discharging cycles illustrating excellent stability of the electrode materials.\n\n[0086] FIGS. 12 and 13 show the sodium storage perfor- mance of Ketjen Black electrodes in SIBs with a reversible capacity of ~105 mAh g~' at a current density of 50 mA g\u2122!. It means that the absolute specific capacity of BHT-BQ- COF-based anode is about 60 mAh gp at a current density of 50mAg\u2122.\n\nExample 10\n\nFabrication of the Full SIB Coin Cell with the BHT-BQ-COF-Based Cathode and the Presodiated BHT-BQ-COF-Based Anode\n\nsmaller\n\nAn\n\n[0087] o-ring was placed on a cap and pressed against the case. Next, a spring, a stainless steel spacer and. the presodiated BHT-BQ-COF-based anode obtained in Example 7 were placed on the o-ring sequentially, with the cast film of the anode facing upwards. After that, a separator (glass fiber) was placed on top of the anode as centered as possible. 200 pL of 1M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF,) in diglyme as the electrolyte was then dropped onto the separator. Next, the BHT-BQ-COF-based cathode obtained in Example 4 was placed on top, with the cast film facing the anode and centered as much as possible with the anode to avoid uneven current densities. Finally the larger case was placed on top and the coin cell was packed with 0.8\n\nkPa pressure.\n\nExample 11\n\nDevice Performance of Symmetric Full SIB Coin Cell Utilizing BHT-BQ-COF-Based Electrode", "type": "Document"}}
