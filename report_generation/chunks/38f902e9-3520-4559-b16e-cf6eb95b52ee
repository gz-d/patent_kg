An artificial superomniphobic surface was first reproduced to mimic the soft, semitrans- parent, and liquid-repellent springtail skin (FIG. 4A). FIG. 4B shows the optical image of the as-fabricated, flexible, transparent polypropylene (PP) surface exhibiting excellent repellency to liquids even including hexane (surface tension: ~18.6 mN/m). In particular, the surface also displays a superior dynamic wetting property as evidenced by the complete rebounding of hexane droplet (FIG. 4C). Such a superior wetting property is ascribed to the presence of pillar arrays decorated with doubly reentrant structures (FIGS. 4D, 4E\uff0cand 4F), which are faithfully transferred from their masters using CECE with the time and cost several orders of magnitude lower than those of standard 3D prototyping methods. Remarkably, owing to its strong flexibility and elastic deformation, these doubly reentrant structures pre- serve their structural integrity and liquid repellence during repeated bending deformation. The bending test was con- ducted by using a buckling device with defined curvatures (k, as illustrated in FIG. 4F) at a frequency of 50 cycles per minute. For water and ultralow-surface tension liquids (e.g.\uff0c ethanol and hexane), no obvious decay in the dynamic wetting property was observed until the buckling cycles are up to 100,000 and 70,000, respectively (FIG. 4G). In con- trast, for the counterparts based on rigid materials, the surfaces are easily broken and their liquid repellences are lost after only several cycles of buckling. These complicated reentrant structures can also be fabricated on other chemi- cally inert materials, e.g., polyethylene (PE), thus offering\n\n[0089] Materials and Methods", "type": "Document"}}
