After administering acompound to the fish embryos, the embryos are to be main- tained at 28\u00b0 C. until 28 hpfand 52 hpf, respectively. Twenty- four and forty-eight hours after adding the compound to the medium in which the fish embryos are cultured, the embryos are then visually inspected for mortality, movements and gross morphological defects under a dissecting microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The number of dead embryos of the 20 embryos tested in each experiment is then to be scored. Data collected from the 15 replicates are to be tested for the hypothesis that no differences existed between mortality over all concentrations. Analyses of variance are then done, along with the post-hoc Tukey\u2019s honestly significant differ- ence test to determine the differences in mortality between treatment concentrations and the untreated control. Likewise, analyses of variance and the post-hoc Tukey honest signifi- cant difference test are both used to determine the differences in total adverse effects between treatment concentrations and the untreated control. The software Statistica for Windows (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla., USA) is to be used for the calcula- tions.\n\nd. Endogenous Alkaline Phosphatase Staining\n\nEmbryos older than 72 hpf can be used for endogenous alkaline phosphatase staining Specifically, embryos are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and 1% Triton x-100. Embryos are fixed for overnight at 4\u00b0 C. and then washed four times in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 (PBT) for 5 minutes. For stain- ing, the embryos are equilibrated three times in a TMNT buffer (0.1M Tris-HCI pH 9.5; 50 mM MgCl,; 0.1 M NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After the embryos are equilibrated, they are stained in substrate solution (4.5 wl of 75 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 3.5 wL of 50 mg/ml X-phosphate for 1 ml of TMNT solution).\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55", "type": "Document"}}
