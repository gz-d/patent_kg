To fabricate the positive electrodes, the pristine NCM811 and PGE-NCM811 were each thoroughly mixed with super-P carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 in weight) in N-methyl-pyrrolidone. Each obtained slurry was spread onto an Al foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 120\u00b0 C. for 10 hours, then punched and weighed. The mass loading of active materials was about 2 mg-cm7. Galvano- static charge-discharge cycling of the cells was performed under the cut-off voltages of 3.0 V to 4.3 V (vs. Lit*/Li). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was mea- sured by an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 2273) with an amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz. Potentiostatic intermittent titration tech- nique (PITT) measurement was conducted by applying a series of potentials from 3.7 V to 4.3 V with a step of 25 mV\n\nand then recording the current after the current was less than\n\nUS 2022/0115659 Al\n\n0.01 C in each step. The Li* diffusion coefficient, (cm?-s~'), was calculated from the slope of In I(t) vs. t plot using the equation:\n\nby\n\ndin(l) 41? \u65b9 = - dt ow\n\n[0034] Here I(t) stands for the transient current (mA), t is the time (s) and L stands for thickness of the electrodes (cm).\n\nSample Characterizations", "type": "Document"}}
