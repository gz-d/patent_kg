In the example measurement setup of FIG. 17, a VDI WR1.5 SAX mixer (Virginia Diodes Inc.) con- nected to the Keysight signal analyzer N9041B (Keysight Technologies, Inc.) is used to detect the radiation signal of the chip (of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array) received by the VDI WR1.5 diagonal horn antenna (Virginia Diodes Tnc.). As shown in FIG. 17, an absorber is used to cover the front metal panel of the mixer to avoid multiple reflections.\n\n[0197] FIG. 19A shows the measured spectrum of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array at 674.85 GHz. The output frequencies can be tuned by changing the supply and bias voltages. FIG. 19B shows simulated and measured frequency tuning range associated with the 12x12 coupled oscillator array of FIG. 15. As shown in FIG. 19B, a 6.9% tuning range exists from 643 GHz to 689 GHz. It is noted the bias voltage shown in FIG. 19B is for one subarray of the array, and the bias voltages for other subarrays are slightly tuned to ensure that the radiated terahertz electromagnetic radiation beam is in the broadside direction.\n\n[0198] The EIRP and radiated power are also measured. with the beam tuned for broadside radiation. In the mea- surement, the distance between the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array and horn antenna is about 30 cm, satisfying the far-field condition. The path loss, conversion loss of the mixer, and cable loss are calibrated using the example calibration setup in FIG. 18. With the calibrated data and measured power from the spectrum analyzer, the EIRP of the chip is calculated and shown in FIG. 20, which shows simulated and measured effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the chip of the 12x12 coupled oscillator array of FIG. 15.", "type": "Document"}}
