In a particular embodiment, the biodegradable metallic materials can include magnesium and/or magne- sium alloys. In an embodiment, the biodegradable polymer can be derived from e-caprolactone, either used alone or combined with other lactone monomers. The other lactone monomers, can include, for example, y-butyrolactone (y-BL), 5-valerolactone (8-VL), y-valerolactone (y-VL), and y-caprolactone (y-CL). In further embodiments, other mono- mers can be used, for example, xylitol can be used to form\n\nThe biodegradable metallic materials can be surface- treated. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable metallic materials can be surface-treated by heat treatment, magne- tron sputtering, plasma immersion ion implantation, or plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition before mixing with the polymer component.\n\nThe hybrid materials of the subject invention, which can be used as biodegradable implants, can include polymeric and metallic materials. Referring to FIG. 1, the hybrid material can include a biodegradable metal with a surface treatment and a biodegradable polymer.\n\nBiodegradable implants can an advantage over biodegradable polymeric implants since metal has better mechanical properties than polymers; this can be particularly advantageous in instances where the implants are used in a high load-bearing situation. Biodegradable metallic materials, such as magnesium alloys, are able to withstand higher mechanical loading than biodegradable polymeric materials. In an embodiment of the present inven- tion, the biodegradable metallic material can include mag- nesium and/or a magnesium alloy. In another embodiment, the biodegradable metallic material can include iron and/or an iron alloy. In certain embodiments of the subject inven- tion, the biodegradable metallic materials can be beads,", "type": "Document"}}
