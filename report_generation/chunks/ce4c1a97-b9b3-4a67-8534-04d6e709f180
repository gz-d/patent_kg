The second is INTT operation, and the third is NIT operation. Both NTT and INTT operations include modular multiplication and occupy around 34% of the computing time. The fourth is the PWM operation, which is the point-wise modular multiplication with differ- ent polynomials. The fifth is the PWA operation, which includes point-wise addition/subtraction, and their subse- quent modular operations. Sampling operation occupies around 2% of the total time, which includes the rejection eta sampling and rejection uniform sampling. There are 5% remaining operations are listed as Others, such as signature pack operation for 0.57%, signature unpack operation for 39%, the decompose operation in make/use hint for 08%, check norm operation in signature checking for 0.56%, the SampleInBall operation for 0.06%, etc.\n\nthe multiplication/addition of matrices and vectors, while the SHAKE module is responsible for all the hash related works. The cooperation of these modules could manage up to 94.91% of the computation in Dilithium. In order to increase the design flexibility to support Dilithium compu- tation for all the security levels, the hardware modules may be parameterized to support runtime configuration.\n\n[0074] The remaining functions, such as signature pack and unpack operations, and the decompose operation, are neither time-consuming nor friendly to hardware design, therefore may be kept running in the software. Alternatively, they may also be implemented as hardware modules in some alternative examples.", "type": "Document"}}
