To cope with different types of load, that synchronous rectifier circuit can \u00a2 initially inactivated in order to allow the body-diodes of the 6 MOSFETs to conduct like a normal 3-phase diode rectifier. Using timing circuits, the conduction periods of the MOS- FETs\u2019 bode diodes are then registered. Such conduction time information is then used to control the conduction time of the MOSFETS. However, this approach has at least three major imitations. First, with the use of voltage detection only, the logic circuits have to be tailor-made to cater for a particular application. Second, since a diode will turn off only when its current is reversed and has gone through the reverse-recovery rocess using voltage detection cannot guarantee equivalent diode bridge rectification functions under all types of loads and circumstances. Third, a DC power supply derived from the AC voltage supply is desired to power the control elec- tronics. While a DC power supply for the control circuitry can derived from the input AC voltage source with the aid of isolation transformers, transformers cannot be easily inte- grated into the same package with the MOSFETs in a com- act way, and as a result, the control circuitry with the trans- formers will take up significant space and cannot be built in the same package with the MOSFETs, and as further result, will not be able to form a replacement block for a diode\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELAIED APPLICATION AND CLAIM FOR PRIORITY", "type": "Document"}}
