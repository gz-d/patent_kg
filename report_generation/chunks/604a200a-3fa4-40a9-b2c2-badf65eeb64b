At or near time ta, the switch M, can switch from an on state to an off state based at least in part on the predefined threshold switching voltage applicable to switch M,,, and the switch Ms can remain in an on state to facilitate maintaining the switch 2102 (M,) in an off state. The current can flow through the source drain diode of the switch 2102 (M,). Commutation can occur at or near time t,.\n\nReferring 254A, operation sys- tem 2500 (and the system 2100 and FIG. 21) during a time prior to time t,. During the time period prior to time t,, the voltage v_,, can be at a higher voltage level than the voltage V (e.g., the voltage level for capacitor C,). Both the current directions in resistors R; and Rg can be from left to right as illustrated in FIG. 25A. The voltage vz; can be clamped to a zero voltage by the collector-base p-n junction of the transis- tor Qs. Asa result, the switch M, (e.g., a p-channel MOSFET My) can be switched to an on state, and the switch Ms (e.g., the n-channel MOSFET Mg) can be switched to an off state, wherein such condition can maintain the gate-source voltage of the switch 2102 (M, ) ata high level, thus turning the switch 2102 (M,) to an on state. Also, during the time period prior to time t,, the current in the resistor Rg can flow through the base-collector p-n junction of the transistor Q,, which can clamp the voltage vz\u00a24, at a specified voltage V. Due in part to the diode D, being reverse biased, the gate-source voltage of the switch M,, can be maintained at a specified voltage V. Asa result, the switch Me can be in an off state and the switch M,, can be in an on state to facilitate maintaining the gate- source voltage of the switch 2104 (M,) at a low level, and", "type": "Document"}}
