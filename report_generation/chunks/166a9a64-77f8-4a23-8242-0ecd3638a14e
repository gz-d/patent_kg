The quan- tization table contains the boundary points of quantization sub zones for each (i,j) position region and the quantization point which each sub zone is associated with. For example, boundary points A/2a2, 3A/2a and 5A/2a? and corresponding quantization points 0, 1, 2 respectively\u2014see position region I in FIG. 6). The quantization point may be stored separately from the boundary point or alternatively inferred from the position in which the boundary point is stored in the table. The data from the quantization table is stored in the look up table 522,552, 562 ofeach circuit 520, 530, 540. Alternatively each look up table may only contain the data relevant for that circuit\u2019s position region (so circuit 520 for calculating {,,* has the data for position region I, the look up table of circuit 530 for calculating \u4eba has data for position region II] and circuit 540 for calculating f,,* has the data for position region II\u2014see FIG. 3). It may also be possible for each circuit to", "type": "Document"}}
