For example, the battery 100 may physically deform into different irregular shapes under the conditions o bending, folding, squeezing, twisting, cutting, and hammering while dissipating energy therefrom, and maintaining mance. In other words, the e withstanding a certain amount the electrochemical perfor- lectrolyte may be capable of of mechanical forces applied thereto while the integrity of the electrolyte and thereby the battery is maintained.\n\n[0143] Alternatively, the cathode 104 may comprise other active materials such as LiMn,O, or polypyrrole deposited or electroplated onto substrate 110.\n\n[0144] In one example, each of the anode 102 and the cathode 104 may be enclosed by an encapsulation 130 (not shown). That is, the anode 102 and the cathode 104 may be in contact with the electrolyte 106 through the encapsulation 130. The encapsulation 130 on the one hand may function as an electrode protector by dissipating the energy applied thereonto. On the other hand, the encapsulation 130 may synergistically work with the electrolyte 106 so as to dissi- pating the energy applied on the battery 100, maintaining the integrity and durability of the battery.\n\n[0151] With reference to F IG. 1B, there is provided an alternative configuration of battery 100 (i.e. battery 100\u00b0). The battery 100' may have a similar configuration to the battery 100 in view of electrodes and electrolyte. The battery 100' may have an anode 102 and a cathode 104 being spaced apart from each other. Each of the electrodes 102, 104 may\n\n[0145] The encapsulation 130 may include a polymer or polymer matrix. The polymer or polymer matrix may have", "type": "Document"}}
