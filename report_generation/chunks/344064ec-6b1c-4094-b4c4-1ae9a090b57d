If the comparator 524 judges that | \u4e86 zl is larger than the current boundary point, then a \u2018Loop\u2019 signal signal is issued which tells counter 523 to increment its count by one and causes the pointer in RAM 522 to shift forward and point to the next boundary point in the look up table. This process continues until the comparator 524 finds If,,*| that is smaller than the current boundary point. The comparator 524 then generates an \u2018Out\u2019 signal which resets the pointer to the initial position and causes the counter 525 to output its accu- mulated count (which is the quantized value z,,). The \u2018Out\u2019 signal also causes the register to output the current inverse quantized value, f, yy (which may be stored in the look up table or calculated at that moment, for example by multiplying the quantized value by a quantization parameter stored in the look up table). From the structure in FIG. 9, it can be seen that the proposed table-lookup quantization process is very suitable for hardware implementation, since it does not require com- plicated operation modules and can execute in parallel mode.\n\nWhile FIG. 11 shows just two different encoding modes, possible for there to be three or more different encoding modes. In that case the rate distortion of each encoding mode may be computed separately, compared and the mode with lowest rate distortion selected.\n\nAs mentioned above the area for which the rate-distortion is calculated may contain one or more blocks. The area may contain a different number of blocks according to the encod- ing mode used (i.e. the encoding mode determines the num- ber and size of the blocks which the area is split into). How- ever, as the rate-distortion for the entire area is computed (e.g. as the sum of the rate-distortion cost of all the blocks in the area), the rate-distortion of different encoding modes may be compared even if the different encoding modes produce dif- ferent numbers and sizes of blocks.", "type": "Document"}}
