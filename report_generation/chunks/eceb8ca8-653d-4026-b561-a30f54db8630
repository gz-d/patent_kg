The precoder device in accordance with claim wherein the analogue delay element includes art analogue delay-line.\n\n[0068] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.\n\n13. The precoder device in accordance with claim wherein the analogue delay-line includes a plurality printed circuit board traces connected with each of sub-channels.\n\n14. The precoder device in accordance with claim wherein the analogue delay-line includes a plurality signal traces on dielectric material connected with each sub-channels.\n\n[0069] Any reference to prior, art contained herein is not be taken as an admission that the information is common general knowledge, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n1. A precoder device for a communication system, com- prising: a delay element arranged to introduce a delay to plurality of sob-channels of a signal at a transmitter end the communication system;\n\n15. The precoder device in accordance with claim wherein the delay element is provided in the output stage transmitter end.\n\n16. A wireless communication system comprising a wire- less signal transmitter having a precoder device and a wireless signal receiver, wherein the precoder device com- prises: a delay element arranged to introduce a delay to a plurality of sub-channels of a signal at the wireless signal transmitter;\n\nwherein the delay in a plurality of sub-channels are associ- with a process time of a receiver component at receiver end of the communication system.\n\n2. The precoder device in accordance with claim wherein the delay includes an incremental time delay intro- duced to the plurality of sub-channels signals.", "type": "Document"}}
