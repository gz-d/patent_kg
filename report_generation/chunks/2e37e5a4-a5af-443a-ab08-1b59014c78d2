A second group of electromagnetic devices is energized by using the first energizing current value in a second direction opposite to the first direction. A third group of electromagnetic devices is energized by using a second energizing current value in the first direction. A fourth group of electromagnetic devices is energized by using the second energizing current value in the second direction. As a result, a local minimum point of magnetic flux density in the workspace is formed.

The vertical axis represents magnetic flux density, while the horizontal axis represents distance.\n\n[0094] In some embodiments, a first group of electromag- netic devices and a second group of electromagnetic devices are energized by using a first energizing current value in a first direction. A third group of electromagnetic devices and a fourth group of electromagnetic devices are energized by using the first energizing current value in a second direction opposite to the first direction. A local minimum point of magnetic flux density in the workspace is formed, such that the magnetic field is zero at the local minimum point. An optimized magnetic field gradient at the center of the work- space can be obtained by adjusting location of the local minimum point.\n\n[0095] In some other embodiments, the electromagnetic devices can be divided into more than four groups. Other activation strategies may be implemented. The methods as exemplified herein provides flexibility to adapt to industrial needs and also achieve gradient-enhanced magnetic field that improves driving of actuation subject.", "type": "Document"}}
