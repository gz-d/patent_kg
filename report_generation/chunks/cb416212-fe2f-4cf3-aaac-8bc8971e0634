Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said winding extends about the periphery of the charging surface and wherein said second winding is located at the center said charging surface.\n\nThe principal and the auxiliary winding may be connected together in parallel or in series and may be driven in phase and the same polarity. Alternatively the auxiliary winding may be driven separately from the principal winding such that the flux generated by the auxiliary winding can be controlled so as to be sufficient to compensate for the voltage sag without generating any undesirable flux peak as it is desirable that the flux generated over the surface of the charging platform should be as uniform as possible.\n\n12. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said second winding is a spiral winding.\n\n13. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said and said second winding are generally rectangular.\n\n14. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said and said second winding are generally circular.\n\n15. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein a third wind- ing is provided located within said area defined by said first winding.\n\nIt will be understood that in preferred embodiments the present invention is particularly suitable for use with planar windings where the lateral dimensions (e.g., width and length ofa rectangular winding or circumference of a circular wind- ing) are substantially greater than the thickness or height of the winding whether it is a very thin winding such as a conductive track on a PCB, or a slightly thicker winding\n\n16. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the magnitude the flux generated by the first winding is greater than magnitude of the flux generated by the second winding.\n\nee Ok Ok OF\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65", "type": "Document"}}
