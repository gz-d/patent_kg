Briefly, A549 cells plated in triplicates in 96-well plates were pretreated with different doses of berbamine (5 uM, 15 1M or 30 uM), fangchinoline (10 uM, 20 uM or 30 pM) or isotetrandrine (10 1M, 20 uM or 40 uM) for 1 h before infected with about 10 MOI of Dengue virus type 2 (DENV- 2). Cells were then fixed at 24 h.p.i. and subjected to DSRNA immunostaining to detect DENV-2 replication.\n\n[0090] As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, all berbamine, isotetrandrine, and fangchinoline can significantly inhibit DENV-2 infection in A549 cells in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate that berbamine and its analogues are potent anti-DENV agents and may be used as pan-anti-flavivirus agents.\n\nIdentification of Compounds with a Similar Structure by Virtual Screening\n\n[0091] The inventors identified further 13 compounds ligand-based virtual drug screening by using berbamine reference.
