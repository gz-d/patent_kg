In order to select the transmitter winding(s) 7 to be energized, each transmitter winding 7 can be periodi- cally energized for a short time at low power. If there is a receiver winding 8 enclosing a transmitter winding 7, the impedance of the transmitter winding 7 will be changed and can be detected indicating the presence of a load. However, load detection alone is not the only condition for determining the selection of the transmitter windings for energy transfer. Load identification and compatibility check are also needed and will be discussed further below. Furthermore if two trans- mitter windings 7 are found to be covered by a single receiver winding 8, a choice may be made as to which of the transmit- ter windings is to be energized based for example upon which of the transmitter windings 7 couples the most strongly to the receiver winding 8.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 5, x has the relationship with d, as given by equation (1):\n\nxvid aw\n\nThen the diameter of the receiver winding, D, can be expressed by (2):\n\nd= Sexsxt$ 24+ v2 @\n\nThe area ratio between one receiver and transmitter windings\n\n\u7ad9 2 Areceiver ADA22 _ receiver _ = ad {27 (1+ V2)\" = 5.8284 A transmitter", "type": "Document"}}
