In the switching-on mode, the gate-like droplet serves as a resistor, and the PTFE can be considered as a capacitor Cp, in which the water/PTFE serves as the top plate and PTFE/ITO as the bottom plate, respectively. The voltage across the capacitor is written as do,/e,, where Gp, ep and d are the charge density, dielectric constant and thickness of PTFE, respectively. Two additional capacitors are also established at the water/PTFE interface and the water/drain interface, respectively, thus forming a closed- circuit. Please see FIGS. 14a to 14d. Since the capacitance of the capacitor CP is three orders of magnitude smaller than of the two capacitors at water/PTFE and water/drain inter- face, almost all these positive charges stored on the bottom\n\n[0073] The following provides more description of experiments leading to the present invention.\n\nelectricity generation.\n\n[0071]\n\nOur transistor-like design is also generic to water\n\non the TIDE-G made of PTFE.
