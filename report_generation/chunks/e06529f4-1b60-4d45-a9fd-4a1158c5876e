In an aspect, the barrier component 500 can include a communicator compo- nent 502 that can facilitate communication (e.g., transmis- sion, reception) of information between components within the barrier component 500 or communication between the barrier component 500 and other components (e.g., barrier control component, projector screen component) associated with the barrier component 500. The communicator compo- nent 502 can communicate data via a wireline or wireless communication connection using one or more specified com- munication protocols and one or more types of communica- tion technology (e.g., wireless communication technology, such as Bluetooth, cellular, Near Field Communication (NFC), etc.), for example, as are known in the art. To facilitate wireless communication of data, the communicator compo- nent 502 can comprise, for example, one or more antennas that can receive a signal(s) from and/or transmit a signal(s) to a wireless device (e.g., barrier control component), wireless ports and routers, and so forth, that operate in a communica- tion network (e.g., radio access network). It should be appre- ciated that one or more antennas can be part of communica- tion platform, which can comprise electronic components and associated circuitry that provide for processing and manipulation of received signal(s) and signal(s) to be trans- mitted, e.g., receivers and transmitters, multiplexer/demulti-", "type": "Document"}}
