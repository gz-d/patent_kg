For instance, while the focusing properties of a parabolic curve on an incident parallel beam can be well suited, for example, for maximizing reflected communications signals at communi- cations antenna (e.g., antenna 706, such as a horn antenna), other considerations can militate against using such one- sided considerations. As an example, in yet other non-limit- ing implementations, given the power requirements, physical spacing considerations, reflector geometry, solar energy duty cycle, and so on, the location or placement of the communi- cations antenna (or portions thereof) can be varied in order to maximize the reflected communications signals, to maximize collection and transmission of the incident solar radiation (e.g., such incident light 322 (522), etc. with regard to FIGS. 3-6), to or effect any other desired design tradeoff between these and/or other considerations.", "type": "Document"}}
