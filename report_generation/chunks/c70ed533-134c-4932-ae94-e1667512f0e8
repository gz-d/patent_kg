The correction member is capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force for correcting spinal deformities. The correction device so formed is thus capable of gradually and fully correcting spinal deformities without further manipulation of the cor- rection member after the spinal correction surgery.\n\npresent\n\nbe the\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n60\n\na\n\nIn\n\nan\n\nthe the\n\nat\n\nUS 7,976,568 B2\n\n10\n\nand 10b, such as in the form of \u201cC\u201d or \u201cS\u201d shaped supporting\n\nor more anchor members 30 can be linked to at least one of the\n\nsupport member 10 and the deformed spine portion 4 but left\n\nrods 12a and 12b.
