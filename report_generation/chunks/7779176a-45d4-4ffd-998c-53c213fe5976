Recently, it has been reported that the ear and its surrounding areas also possess a low thermal threshold, indicating high sensitivity to thermal variations. Treede et al. found that hairy skin is more heat sensitive than a glabrous skin portion (that 1s, skin without hair). Recent research on the on-finger thermal feedback supports this finding of the difference on the thermal sensi- tivity between hairy and glabrous skins. As the hair and the skin thickness vary around the ear, it is reasonable to hypothesize that different areas around the ear may yield different thermal sensitivities, making it non-trivial for designing auricular thermal\n\npatterns.\n\n[0047] Thermal Earhook Design\n\near-mounted\n\nFIG.\n\n1A\n\n[0048] schematically depicts an wearable device for providing thermal stimuli to a user in the region surrounding the outer ear. The device can provide various thermal patterns on the surface depending on the input or pre-set parameters. The user wearing the earhook can feel thermal feedback on single or multiple points on the auricular areas. Different levels of notifications with distinct intensities and patterns (optionally predetermined by the users) corresponds to the signals received from the con- nected external devices. These patterns may be helpful to guide the users with their navigation directions, alarms and other electronic notifications as, for example, by a smart- other electronic device.\n\nphone, laptop, or\n\ndevice\n\nwearable\n\n1A,\n\nFIG.\n\n100\n\nto", "type": "Document"}}
