The annealing time is in a range of 30 to 600 minutes, and the annealing temperature is in a range of 300 to 900\u00b0 C.\n\n[0023] A second aspect of the present invention provides a metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure, where a metal nanoparticle constitutes a core and an amorphous carbon-containing phase having a thickness of approxi- mately 2 nm or less constitutes a shell, and the shell surrounds a portion or the entirety of the core.\n\na\n\n[0024] A third aspect of the present invention provides substrate selected from a porous metal grid, a (porous) ceramic plate, a silicon substrate, a fused silica substrate glass substrate having a uniform dispersion of the metal- carbon composite formed thereon.\n\n[0025] In accordance to one embodiment, the size distri- bution of the metal-carbon composite of a core-shell struc- ture is in a range of 20 to 800 nm.\n\n[0026] Compared to the traditional methods for the syn- thesis and deployment of nanoparticles, the metal-carbon composite of a core-shell structure made by the present method have the following advantages:\n\n[0027] (1) the present method allows deploying nan- oparticles on various materials regardless of their sur- face topologies (e.g., planar, rough, or porous surfaces), which are attractive for the surface modification of complex-shaped materials and structures, such as elec- trodes in energy related applications and biosensors in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering;", "type": "Document"}}
