They were asked to move | bead at a time to reach the target position as quickly as possible with the minimum number of moves and to plan the moves in mind before execution. In total there were 10 trials. The total number of extra moves, number of correct trials, total planning time before executing the first move, and total execution time for the moves were measured.\n\n(2) Flanker task (see, e.g., Ridderinkhof, Band, & Logan, 1999) for testing selective attention: Participants judged the direction of an arrow flanked by 4 other arrows. In the congruent condition, the flanking arrows pointed at the same direction as the target arrow, whereas in the incongruent condition, the flanking arrows pointed at the opposite direction. In the neutral condition, the flankers were non-directional symbols.\n\n(3) Verbal and visuospatial 2-back task for assessing working memory capacity (see, e.g., Lau et al., 2010): In each trial, participants judged whether the presented symbol/symbol\n\n10\n\n] >\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWO 2021/087651\n\nPCT/CN2019/115288\n\n18\n\nlocation was the same as the one presented 2 trials back in the verbal/visuospatial task respectively.\n\nParticipants\u2019 eye movements during the passive viewing phase were analyzed using", "type": "Document"}}
