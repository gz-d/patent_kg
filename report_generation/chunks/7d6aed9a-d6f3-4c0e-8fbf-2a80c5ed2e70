In other words, the disclosed subject matter can enable the disclosed synchronous rectifier to replace the diode rectifier without the need to know the nature of the load. In addition, the control electronics can be powered by a por- tion of the AC voltage source or preferably a portion of the rectified DC voltage of the power rectifier circuit without the need for another specially designed auxiliary switched mode supply or transformers.\n\ncan synchronously rectify a received signal (e.g., power sig- nal) in accordance with various embodiments and aspects. In an aspect, the system 100 can comprise components and associated circuitry that form a synchronous rectifier (e.g., self-drive synchronous rectifier (also referred to herein as SDSR)), which includes self-driven control circuitry that can be employed in high-voltage power applications while pro- viding the benefit ofa significantly smaller conduction loss as compared to, for example, a conventional diode bridge. The system 100 can receive a signal, such as, for example, an AC power signal, and can rectify the received signal to produce a desired output signal, such as a desired DC signal, which can be supplied to a desired load (e.g., resistive load, capacitive- resistive load, inductive-resistive load) (not shown). As desired, the system 100 can be employed in high-voltage applications (e.g., 110 V or 220 V mains), and also can", "type": "Document"}}
