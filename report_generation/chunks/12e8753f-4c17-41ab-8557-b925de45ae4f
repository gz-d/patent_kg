Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such alternative aspects as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n\n4, body portion of the electrical device and the secondary winding each have a generally circular cross section.\n\n6. Anelectrical device in accordance with claim 4, wherein array of primary coils that generate the lines of magnetic flux that extend generally perpendicular to the planar charg- surface that is disposed beneath the planar charging sur- face.\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n1. An electrical device, comprising:\n\nbody having a portion formed with a circumference extending about an axis;\n\n7. An apparatus, comprising:", "type": "Document"}}
