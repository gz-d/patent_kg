In general, the transmitter windings can be grouped into zones with the number of zones and the number of transmitter windings within each zone depending on the dimensions of the charg- ing surface of the charging pad and the transmitter windings. In FIG. 7, the transmitter windings are grouped into ten zones and each zone has nine transmitter windings. Another advan- tage of the zone approach is that the winding structure as well as the electronics (power switches, controller, etc.) in one zone is scalable and duplicable.\n\nUsing the same argument, other transmitter windings of other shapes and packing methods can be used. For example, FIG. 6 shows the hexagonal packing of hexagonal spiral transmitter windings 7 and an overlying circular receiver winding 8. Again, in the event of any slight movement of the larger receiver winding 8 in any direction at least one trans- mitter winding 7 is still enclosed by the receiver winding. Again, as with FIG. 5 it will be understood that while FIG. 6 only shows three transmitter windings, in practice these windings are only part of a larger regular array of like wind- ings.", "type": "Document"}}
