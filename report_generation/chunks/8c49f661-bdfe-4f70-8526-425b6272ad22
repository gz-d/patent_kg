At this point, the switch 2102 (M,) should be or is turned off before the commutation point and the switch 2104 (M,) should be or is turned on after the commutation point, which can be seen in FIG. 23, which illustrates a diagram of example graph 2300 of example gate-source voltage signals for the three power switches, switch 2102, switch 2104, and switch 2106, versus input voltage from the input voltage source 2126. Due at least in part to the voltage v,, being the lowest in the time period, the voltages vaca and vscoia can be clamped to zero volts by the p-n junction between the collector and base of the transistors Q, and Q,5. This should be noted in the following analysis.\n\nReferring to FIG. 24 and FIGS. 25A through 25H (along with FIG. 21), FIG. 24 depicts a timing diagram of example operation states and parameter values 2400 relating to certain components of the system 2600, in accordance with various aspects. FIGS. 25A through 25H illustrate diagrams of opera- tion, in relation to time, of an example system 2500, which is a portion of the system 2100 comprising the a portion of the high-side gate-drives (e.g., SDGD component 2114 and SDGD component 2116) to facilitate demonstrating opera- tion of the high-side portion of the SDGD subsystem (e.g., high-side gate drives) over time in accordance with various aspects of the disclosed subject matter.", "type": "Document"}}
