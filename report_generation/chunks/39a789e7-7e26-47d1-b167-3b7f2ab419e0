The subject specification can result in a net cost reduction stemming in part from a reduction in the size of the heatsink to be employed when using the SDSR as compared to a traditional diode rectifier as well as the energy-saving (e.g., power loss reduction), which can more than compensate for any potential minor increase in the com- ponent counts of the inexpensive and low-power components in the high-side portion and low-side portion. In another aspect, the subject specification can achieve high system compactness, due in part to reduced heat dissipation (relative to conventional rectifiers), as compared to conventional rec- tifiers. Also, as desired, the control circuit of the disclosed SDSR (e.g., single-phase SDSR, multi-phase SDSR) can in principle be built in the same module block with the power switches (e.g., power MOSFETs) so that the module can be a", "type": "Document"}}
