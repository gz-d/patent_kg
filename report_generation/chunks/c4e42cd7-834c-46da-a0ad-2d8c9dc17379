FIG. 17 shows the measured energy efficiency of the four PCB transformers with 100@ resistive load. In the PCB transformer shielded with only conductive sheets, a layer of insulating sheet of 0.684 mm thickness is used to isolate the transformer winding and the conductive sheets. From FIG. 17, energy efficiency of the transformers increases with increasing frequency. The transformer shielded with copper sheets only has the lowest energy efficiency among the four transformers. The energy loss in the conductive-shielded transformer mainly comes from the eddy current, which is induced from the normal component of the H-field generated from the transformer windings, circulating in the conductive\n\nThe conductive sheets may preferably be copper sheets, but other conductive materials may be used such as alumi- num.\n\nIt should also be understood that while the printed circuit board may be a single board with the two windings formed on opposite sides, it is also possible that the two windings may be formed on separate boards that are laminated together to form a composite structure. It is also possible that the two windings may be formed on separate printed circuit boards that may be incorporated in different devices. Another possibility is that the ferrite plus conductive mate- rial shielding could also be applied to a single winding PCB inductor.\n\nThe energy efficiency of the transformer with no shielding is lower than that of the transformers shielded with ferrite plates. Without ferrite shielding, the input impedance of coreless PCB transformer is relatively low. The energy loss of the coreless transformer is mainly due to its relatively high i7R loss (because of its relatively high input current\n\nis\n\nAs a result, the use of ferrite plates covered with conduc-\n\nthe lead wires.", "type": "Document"}}
