The proportion of time spent chosen side went from chance level 0.5 steadily up until it reached around 0.87. The probability that each participant looked at the chosen stimuli at each time point was estimated a 100-millisecond (ms) interval. To test the hypothesis that across the time intervals there was significant difference in the probability of looking at the chosen side, and that the two groups of participants differed in the time interval effect, a mixed AVOVA was performed probability of looking at the chosen side with time interval as a within-subject variable and group as a between-subject variable. The results showed a significant main effect of time interval, F(3.043, 66.938) = 52.163, p < .001, Np = 0.703, a significant main effect of group, F(1, 22) = 5.481, p = 0.029, np = 0.199, and a marginal interaction between time interval and group, F(3.043, 66.938) = 2.307, p = 0.084, np = 0.095 In addition, there was significant linear trend, F(1, 22) = 126.657, p < 0.001, np = 0.852, and quadratic trend, F(1, = 19.609, p < 0.001, Np = 0.471, across time intervals. These results demonstrated that during the last 2.5 seconds before response, participants had a significant increase probability of looking at the chosen side. In addition, group A had higher a probability\n\nthe\n\nthe\n\nat\n\nthe\n\n22)\n\nlooking at the chosen side than group B, indicating a stronger cascade effect.", "type": "Document"}}
