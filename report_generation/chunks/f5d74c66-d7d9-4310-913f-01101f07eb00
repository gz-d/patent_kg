The barrier control component can transmit the control signal to the barrier component via a wireline or wireless communica- tion connection. In response to receiving the control signal, the barrier component can switch (e.g., automatically or dynamically in real time) to (or remain in) or select (e.g., automatically or dynamically in real time) a specified display mode, such as 2-D mode, 3-D stereoscopic mode, or 3-D autostereoscopic mode, wherein there can be respective bar- rier pattern modes and corresponding barrier patterns that can be utilized in the respective display modes to facilitate desir- ably presenting 2-D content or different types of 3-D content to a viewer (e.g., presenting 2-D content without blurriness, presenting 3-D stereoscopic content or 3-D autostereoscopic\n\nIn accordance with various other embodiments, the barrier control component, barrier component, and/or projector screen component can be associated with an external power supply.
