The structured data and textual data used in mortality prediction module 105 are received from data collection module 104. The data in data pre-processing element 109 includes, but is not limited to, stroke patients\u2019 demographics, diagnosis, family medical history, laboratory results and radiology reports, all of which are then used as input in the machine learning and deep learning models 113. The demographics data includes, but is not limited to, gender and age. Family medical history data may contain indications of new symptoms or illnesses in a family through mapping of International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) Code or other standard codes such as the ICD-9 code. The laboratory result data includes the results from chemical pathology test, haematology test, immunology test, microbiology, test and virology test. Due to the different testing methods and equipment, the detection unit of the sample needs to be unified in the process of data summarizing and pre-processing.
