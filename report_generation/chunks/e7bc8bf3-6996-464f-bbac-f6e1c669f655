It is believed that when activated by NIR in this range, the platinum(IV) complexes herein; or the photoac- tivatable platinum(IV) prodrugs herein, may provide signifi- cant cytotoxicity against various cancer cells, including platinum drug-resistant cancer cells.\n\nIt is further believed that, as compared with current\n\n[0080]\n\nplatinum drugs, the platinum(IV) complexes herein possess a variety of advantages such as, for example, controllable activation, significant penetration ability, significantly reduced cytotoxicity, and the potential to reduce or even prevent bacteria from developing drug resistance. In addi- tion, as compared with conventional photosensitizers, it is believed that the platinum(IV) complexes herein possess a much longer activation wavelength. It is believed that this advantageously enables them to be used at a greater depth from the photoactivation device, and therefore at a greater tissue depth. This in turn allows improved efficacy and greater penetration capacity. Furthermore, as the present Platinum(IV) complexes do not require oxygen for activa- tion/efficacy, the present complexes may possess biological activity irrespective of whether oxygen is present, even under hypoxia, and thus are more flexible and versatile than existing oxygen-dependent photosensitizers, drugs, and.\n\nprodrugs.\n\n[0081] It is also believed that as the present platinum(IV) complexes may become strong oxidants upon photoexcita- tion so they may also robustly destroy components such as, for example, lipopolysaccharides or proteins such as those in a bacterial cell wall (if present) and/or a bacterial cell membrane so as to lyse and kill the bacteria.
