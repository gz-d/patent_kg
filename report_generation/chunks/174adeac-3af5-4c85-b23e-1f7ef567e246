The galva- nostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed on a MACCOR battery cycler at current densities of 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mA g 1. Elec- trochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was obtained by\n\nUS 2024/0079591 Al\n\nMar. 7, 2024\n\napplying a sine wave with an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz on Solartron 1400 electrochemical workstation. As shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, a high reversible discharge capacity of ~90 mAh g can be obtained at a current density of 100 mA g 1. Besides, good cycling stability of SIB can be achieved, which is associated to the stable structure of BHT-BQ-COF.\n\n[0092] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The described embodiments of the inven- tion should therefore be considered in all respects as illus- trative, not restrictive.\n\n[0089] FIGS. 16 and 17 display the rate performance of the symmetric (all-organic) full SIB batteries at a wide current density range of 100 to 3000 mA g7! between 1.0-3.2 V. It shows superior rate capability with reversible discharge capacities of 89.6, 76.9, 67.1, 62.7, 60.4, 57.2, 55.0, 52.2, and 49.2 mAh g\u2122! at 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mA g ', respectively. This demonstrates fast Na* diffusion kinetics in the symmetric all-organic full battery.", "type": "Document"}}
