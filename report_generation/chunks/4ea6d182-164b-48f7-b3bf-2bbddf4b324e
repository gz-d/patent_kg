As the temperature fluctuates, the specific capacity of the AD-battery almost restored to the pristine one. After multiple cycles of cooling-heating-cooling pro- cess, no significant capacity attenuation was identified for the AD-battery, guaranteeing its practical application. The long-term stability of the AD-battery was demonstrated by a prolonged storage of the battery for 30 days. As shown in FIG. 20, the AD-battery exhibited 84.6% capacity retention after a prolonged storage of 30 days in normal condition (25\u00b0 C.) whereas the PAM battery exhibited 0% capacity reten- tion under the conditions.\n\n[0237] Benefitting from its flexible components (the AD- gel, soft stainless steel mesh, and deposited active materials layer) as used, the AD-battery of the present disclosure possessed a high flexibility and architectural durability. As a demonstration of these properties, a series of experiments under extreme conditions including bending tests, soaking tests, anti-freezing evaluations and anti-heating of boiling water experiment were performed on the AD-battery.\n\n[0231] Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots of the AD-battery were also recorded at various temperatures (FIG. 16B). The impedance of the battery increased within a reasonable range from 164 Q at 80\u00b0 C. to 366 Q at -20\u00b0 C., revealing a stable ionic transport. These results confirm the excellent temperature durability and high compatibility of the electrodes and the AD-gel electrolyte.", "type": "Document"}}
