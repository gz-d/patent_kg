These agents were chosen from books of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Out of 1431 compounds, there were 11 showing anti-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentra- tions. The phenomenon of anti-angiogenesis was the absence of at least one intersegmental vessel. Out of 107 herbs, there were 11 showing anti-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentrations. Out of 13 formulas tested, there were 4 showing anti-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentrations while there were 3 showing pro-angiogenic modulating activity at least in one of the tested concentrations.
