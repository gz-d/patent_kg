In some examples, the AC short termination arrangement of the fourth circuit arrangement includes a grounded capacitive arrangement electrically connected in series with the transmission line arrangement. In some examples, the transmission line arrangement of the fourth circuit arrangement includes: a first transmission line portion with an end electrically con- nected in series with the AC short termination arrangement, and a second transmission line portion extending from the first transmission line portion and electrically coupled with\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nthe patch antenna\n\n2604 for capacitively feeding\n\narrangement the patch antenna arrangement. The two transmission line portions may be generally perpendicular.\n\n[0114] Insome embodiments, the construction of the third circuit arrangement and the construction of arrangement are generally identical (but connected to dif- ferent drain terminals of different transistors).\n\nthe fourth circuit\n\n[0115] The oscillator 2602B of the oscillator arrangement is operable to generate third harmonic power (e.g., in the form of electric current). The construction of the oscillator 2602B is generally identical to the construction of the oscillator 2602A. Thus, the above description related to the construction of the oscillator 2602A is application to the oscillator 2602B.", "type": "Document"}}
