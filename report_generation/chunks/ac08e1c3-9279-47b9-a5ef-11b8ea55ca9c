The optimal nanodrug has to avoid clearance by reticuloendothelial system (RES) and filtered by kidney finally achieving long circulation in body. Nanoparticles with uniform size between 50 nm and 100 nm are required for the best circulation results according to previous research. Therefore, the nanodrug labelled Cur-6 prepared using modified template-2, and shown in FIG. 124, having a suitable particle size of 61.1 nm, was used for final anticancer application. FIG. 8 shows that the Cur-6 nanod- rug has have better anticancer effect than free curcumin drug for Hela cell line.\n\n[0071] FIG. 5 shows another embodiment of the same invention, which does not use a microplate. In this embodi- ment, the ice is a singular, large piece of ice 1603. To provide confine and separate surfaces on the ice 1603 for infusion with the hydrophobic solution of a drug, a frame 1601 is provided for placing onto a surface of the large piece of ice.\n\n[0072] The frame 1601 in FIG. 5 is an integral construc- tion of a plurality of parallel plastic panels that are crossed orthogonally with another plurality of plastic panels, which define multiple square cells 1605, which has a fluid sepa-\n\nare\n\n12\n\nis\n\nDec. 23, 2021\n\nration function like the wells 103 of the microplate 101 FIG. 1. The frame 1601 can be made in any other configu- ration, although FIG. 5 only shows one example of a frame.\n\nof\n\n[0073] The dimensions of the frame 1601 are such that it is suitable for being placed on the surface of the piece of ice, and the square cells 1605 of the frame 1601 each provides confinement of an area on the surface of the ice. Each of these areas is suitable for being applied with a suitable amount of drug solution. Advantageously, the solution applied in each of the areas is unable to flow over to the neighbouring area, being separated by the frame 1601.", "type": "Document"}}
