In this example, step 102 includes trans-\n\nUS 2022/0007944 Al\n\nmitting two laser pulses of different wavelengths (e.g., isosbestic wavelengths) to the sample, and step 104 includes receiving two photoacoustic signals from the sample in response to transmission of the two laser pulses. The time difference between transmissions of the two laser pulses may be in the order of micro-seconds, in the order of nano-seconds, etc. Steps 106 and 108 may include deter- mining respective amplitudes of the two photoacoustic sig- nals and applying the determined amplitudes to a flow model that relates photoacoustic signals with flow speed, to deter- mine the blood flow speed. The flow model takes into account errors in the photoacoustic signals (e.g., caused by the Grimeisen relaxation effect).\n\n[0065] In one example, the property may further include hemoglobin concentration in the blood. In this example, steps 106 and 108 may include processing one of the two photoacoustic signals obtained during the blood flow speed measurement based on a photoacoustic absorption model to determine hemoglobin concentration in the blood.", "type": "Document"}}
