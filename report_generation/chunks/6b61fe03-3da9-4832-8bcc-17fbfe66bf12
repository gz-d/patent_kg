Classification of NPC43 and NP460 cells using different measured physical properties are performed. Qua- dratic Discriminate Analysis (QDA) is suitable to discrimi- nate between medical conditions that symptomatically are very similar, such as alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease. In particular, QDA is effective for situations where ratio of sample number to variables count is large. The\n\nof\n\nApr. 21, 2022\n\ncell-type classification using measured whole cell elasticity and cell diameter under a driving pressure of 100 Pa which achieves small cell deformations is shown in FIG. 8A (left). The boundary line is computed based on QDA as an opti- mized separating curve between properties clusters of the two cell-types. To quantify the classification performance, the accuracy (A), sensitivity values for NP460 (S-NP) and NPC43 (S-NPC), and the overall cell-type sensitivity (S) are considered. For the case of small cell deformations, the classification parameters are A=63.2%, S-NP=78.3% and S=S-NPC=58.3%. The procedure is repeated for cell quan- tification under 400 Pa driving pressure to achieve large cell deformations as shown in FIG. 8A (right), with the classi- fication parameters are A=60.6%, S-S-NP=57.9% and SNPC=64.8%, which do not show any improvements com- pared with the classification under the pressure of 100 Pa.\n\nscatter plot graphs for cell\n\nillustrates\n\n[0102]\n\nFIG.\n\n8B", "type": "Document"}}
