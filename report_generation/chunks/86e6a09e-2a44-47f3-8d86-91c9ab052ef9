In FIG. 8B, the harmonic current output is plotted against different second harmonic voltage amplitudes IV ,_ 2fol. It is found that the fundamental current increases as IV; 2f | increases. This can be understood from FIG. 8A. The current waveform recovers from the dip as IV, 2fol increases because the transistor leaves the deep triode region. As the duration of the triode region decreases, the third harmonic current decreases, as shown in FIG. 8B. As for the second harmonic current, it first decreases to a small or minimal value and then increases with |V 2f,]. This behavior can be understood because the transistor is already in the cut-off region. The second harmonic current cancel- ation from active-triode transition is reduced once the triode duration is decreased. FIG. 9B shows simulated harmonic currents at the drain terminal of the transistor under different third harmonic drain voltages |V,_3f| at the drain terminal of the transistor. The harmonic current behaviors shown in FIG. 9B are similar by increasing the amplitude of IV, 3fol because it also reduces the triode region duration and\n\nrecover the current waveform, as shown in FIG. 9A.", "type": "Document"}}
