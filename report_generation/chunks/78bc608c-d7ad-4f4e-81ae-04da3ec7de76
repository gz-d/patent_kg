The neural electrode 104 , as discussed\n\na PC / 104 based computer system , optionally a micro - sized\n\nabove , is preferably implanted in a DCN . The DCN includes\n\nPC / 104 based computer system , with built - in connectors .\n\ndentate nucleus , emboliform nucleus , globose nucleus , and\n\nfastigii nucleus . The neural electrode 104 may be implanted\n\n[ 0070 ] The processor 108 may communicate with the data\n\nto stimulate at least two or more of the dentate nucleus ,\n\nacquisition unit 106 via a wired or wireless network .

In an embodiment , the\n\nUS 2020/0406031 Al\n\nDec. 31, 2020\n\n[0064] FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of the neu- rostimulation system of an embodiment of the present invention. The neurostimulation system 100 includes an EMG electrode 102 for retrieving EMG signals of a subject during movement. The EMG electrode 102 may be config- ured as a surface EMG electrode or an intramuscular EMG electrode. In an embodiment, the EMG electrode is provided to detect and record EMG signals generated in muscles during a gait movement of the subject. The gait is preferably referred to a natural gait such as, but not limited to, walking, jogging, running, and sprinting.", "type": "Document"}}
