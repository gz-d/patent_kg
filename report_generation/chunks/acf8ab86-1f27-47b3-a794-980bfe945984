Carrying out pre-scaled quantizing on ICT transformed block F*, gives the same quantization matrix Z as would be obtained by (unscaled) quantizing of a DCT transformed residual block. The same is true of some other integer image transforms and their discrete equivalents. How- ever, not every integer image transform requires scaling; for example the Walsh and Hadamard transforms are integer image transforms which do not require scaling.\n\na\n\nThe look\n\ntable\n\ncomprise a plurality of quantization\n\ncarried out by using the look up table.\n\nUS 8,019,804 B2\n\n8\n\n7\n\nPreferably the method selects the encoding mode which\n\nPreferably the iterative table-look up process is carried out\n\nin parallel for each coefficient f* of the transformed residual\n\nwill produce the least distortion of the block or the encoding\n\nblock.
