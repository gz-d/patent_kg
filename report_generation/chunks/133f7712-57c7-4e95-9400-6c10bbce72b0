Pig.10 is a simplified version of Fig.7. Each solid square in Fig.10 represents a square-spiral winding pattern in the first layer (Fig.7). Fig.11 is a simplified version of the Fig.8. Each dotted square represents a square-spiral winding pattern in the second layer (Fig.8). The simplified version of the multi-layer array structure is shown in Fig.12. From Fig.12, it can be seen that the overlapped array structure (with correct displacement between the two layers) divides each square-spiral winding pattern into four smaller sub-regions. The important feature is that the four sub-regions are identical in terms of winding structure. Despite that fact that the distribution of the magnetic field magnitude on the surface of each individual square-spiral winding is not uniform, the distribution of the resultant magnitude field magnitude on the surface of each sub-region is more or less identical because of the overlapped multi-layer winding structure. The concept of the generating uniform magnetic field magnitude over the energy transfer surface is\n\nillustrated in Fig.\n\n13.\n\nIn this example, a multi-layer transformer winding array structure that can provide a uniform magnetic field magnitude distribution is described. This example is based on square-spiral winding patterns. In principle, winding pattems of other shapes can also be applied as long as the resultant magnetic field magnitude distribution is as uniform as possible.", "type": "Document"}}
