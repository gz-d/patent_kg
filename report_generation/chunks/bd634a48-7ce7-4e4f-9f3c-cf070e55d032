Examples of these include spatial diversity and polarization diversity.\n\n[0015] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the substrate assembly further includes a microstrip line network arranged on the second substrate layer on a side opposite the ground plane. The microstrip line network is operably connected. with the feeding network.\n\n[0004] In spatial diversity, multiple antennas, usually of the same characteristics, are separated by a certain distance that is preferably commensurate with the wavelength. The antennas can use the same operation mode. This arrange- ment, while useful is some applications, is rather bulky and suffers from high correlation and high cost.\n\n[0016] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the substrate assembly further includes a feed probe extending through first and second substrate layers, the feed probe arranged to operably connect the feeding network with microstrip line network.\n\n[0005] In polarization diversity, a dual-polarized antenna with different polarizations of is generally used, and the signals are processed independently. This arrangement offers potential for diversity combining, and can mitigate polarization mismatches that would otherwise cause signal fade.\n\n[0017] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the feed network includes a first network portion arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element to produce the first linearly- polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern, and a second. network portion arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element to produce the second linearly-polarized omnidi- rectional radiation pattern\n\n[0006] There is a need to provide an improved or alter- native antenna that can be used for (but not limited to) polarization diversity.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION", "type": "Document"}}
