The dielectric resonator antenna may provide different dielectric resonator modes (not limited to TE,,,, and Ms modes) that provide different omnidirectional radiation pat- terns, in particular linearly-polarized omnidirectional radia- tion patterns. The dielectric resonator modes may alterna- tively be other antenna modes such as monopole antenna mode or loop antenna mode.\n\n10. The dielectric resonator antenna of claim 9, wherein feed network comprises:\n\nfirst network portion arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element to produce the first linearly-polarized omnidirectional radiation pattern; and\n\na second network portion arranged to feed the dielectric resonator element to produce the second linearly-po- larized omnidirectional radiation pattern", "type": "Document"}}
