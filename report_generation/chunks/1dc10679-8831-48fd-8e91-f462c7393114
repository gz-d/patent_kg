In addition, the hypothesis was tested that the inference accuracy of group was significantly higher than that of group B. The result supported the hypothesis, t(22) 3.26, p = .004, d = 1.33. In addition, the more similar participants\u2019 eye movement patterns during the preference biased period to the representative pattern of group A, as opposed that of group B (as measured in A-B scale), the higher the inference accuracy (r = .47, p = FIGURE 10B). This result was consistent with the observation that group A exhibited stronger gaze cascade effect (FIGURE 7). The clustering of the two groups was completely based on the eye movement data alone, and thus the group difference in inference accuracy\n\n=\n\nemerged naturally as the result of the clustering.\n\nIt was also tested whether a regular HMM without inferring participants\u2019 cognitive", "type": "Document"}}
