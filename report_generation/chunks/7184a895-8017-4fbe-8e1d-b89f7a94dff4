The modified protein harboring R245A and N413A mutations and the modified protein harboring R245A, N413A, N419A mutations had significantly low off-target activity. Mutation at the N413 position had a significant effect on the number of off-target sites, for example, with reference to FIG. 4A, at VEGFA_8, the modified protein harboring N413A and R245A mutations had significantly lower number of off- target sites compared to the modified protein without a mutation at the N413 position and harboring R245A-N419 mutations. The positive effect of a mutation at the N413 position in reducing the number of off-target sites at VEGFA_8 is also exemplified in FIG. 4A where the modi- fied protein harboring the R245A, N413A, N419A, and. R654A mutations, i.e. SaCas9-HF, had a significantly lower number of off-target sites compared to the modified protein harboring R245A, N419A and R654A mutations, i.e. with- out a mutation at the N413 position, showing the advanta- geous effect of the mutation at the N413 position in improv-\n\nExample 3\n\n35\n\nGenome-Wide Targeting Specificity at Expanded Endogenous Sites\n\nTo further evaluate SaCas9 mutant genome-wide target- ing specificity, the inventors performed GUIDE-seq analy- ses to include all of the eleven endogenous sites (6 canonical and 5 non-canonical PAMs) previously subjected to GUIDE-seg. A quadruple mutant, i.e. a modified protein containing four amino acid substitutions referred to as SaCas9-HF (with the following four amino acid mutations: R245A, N413A, N419A, and R654A), was generated to test the combined effectiveness of four mutations.
