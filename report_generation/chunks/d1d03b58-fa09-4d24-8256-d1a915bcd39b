[0124] The radiator units 2700-1, 2700-3 in adjacent rows\n\nmay be operably (e.g., electrically) coupled via a coupling arrangement. In some embodiments, the coupling arrange- ment includes two couplers, one electrically connected. between one oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and one oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2, and another electrically connected between another oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and another oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2. The two couplers may be odd-mode-shorted couplers each for enabling or sustaining an in-phase coupling mode between the respective two oscillators it electrically con- nects with. In some embodiments, the odd-mode-shorted couplers may each respectively include: a transmission line arrangement electrically connected between the correspond- ing oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and the correspond- ing oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2, one capacitive arrangement electrically connected between the transmis- sion line arrangement and the corresponding oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-1 and operable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode impedance, and one capacitive arrangement elec- trically connected between the transmission line arrange- ment and the oscillator of the radiator unit 2700-2 and\n\noperable to facilitate shorting of an odd-mode impedance. be\n\n[0125] In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 can fabricated using CMOS technologies, such as 65 nm CMOS process/technology. In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 can be arranged in, or formed in, an integrated circuit (chip). In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 is a terahertz,\n\nUS 2024/0266746 Al\n\nradiator configured for terahertz electromagnetic radiation only. In some embodiments, the radiator 2700 is configured for terahertz electromagnetic radiation as well as for elec- tromagnetic radiation at one or more other frequency frequencies.", "type": "Document"}}
