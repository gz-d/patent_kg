No. 60/643,744, filed Jan. 13, 2005, the contents are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nFIG. 1 is a plot of Ni depth profiles acquired from the nitrogen, acetylene and oxygen PIII surface treated samples and control.\n\nFIG. 2 includes photomicrographs of treated and untreated NiTi (control) after two days of cell culturing showing the EGFP expressing mouse osteoblasts. (A) NiTi alloy without surface treatment, (B) with nitrogen PII implantation, (C) with acetylene PIII implantation, and (D) with oxygen PIII implantation.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nShape memory materials such as nickel titanium (NiTi) alloys are promising materials for surgical implants in ortho- pedics due to their unique shape memory effect (SME) and super-elasticity (SE) that other common orthopedic materials such as stainless steels and titanium alloys do not possess. Their mechanical properties are also closer to that of cortical bones than stainless steels and titanium alloys. The materials display superior wear resistance to CoCrMo alloys used in bone trauma fixation. Several other favorable properties of the materials have also been investigated, and good bio-com- patibility has also been reported. However, some negative effects have also been pointed out. For example, Berger- Gorbet et al. have found that the osteogenesis process and osteonectin synthesis activity in NiTi alloys are unfavorable compared to stainless steels and titanium alloys.\u2019 Jia et al. in their study revealed that the cell death rate was severe on NiTi alloys.\u201d\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION,", "type": "Document"}}
