In addition, the introduction of LRSPR effect in the SPR sensing surface can sharpen the resonance peak so that the detection resolution of phase-sensitive SPR biosensors can be further enhanced. The SPR sensor of the present application provides the following advantages: It resolves the issue of limited dynamic range typically associated with monochro- matic laser based phase-sensitive SPR biosensors. It resolves the issue of limited detection sensitivity typically associated. with spectral intensity interrogating SPR biosensors. It over- comes the issue of spectral phase discontinuity associated", "type": "Document"}}
