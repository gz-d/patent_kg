Specifically, when generally rectangular time sequences are adopted, the equivalent magnetic polarizability at the fun- damental frequency in equation (7) can be simplified as Pim-o=Pot,. The spatiotemporal modulation generates an equivalent amplitude of the magnetic polarizability without introducing phase shifts or momentum for the fundamental frequency. In one example, to facilitate guided-wave-to- propagating-wave transformation at the fundamental fre- quency, the equivalent magnetic polarizability is leveraged to form a sinusoidal amplitude modulation along the length of the waveguide such that the n=\u2014l space harmonic becomes fast and radiates into free space (FIG. 28)\n\nFa) = aft 4+ Hf cos (\u5230 \u00ae \u7ad9 \u4e8c _ [4 where M = bea\n\nare the modulation depths for the |) and Ix) components, and A is the spatial period of the sinusoidal amplitude envelope. The radiation of the equivalent magnetic dipole can be viewed as spatially sampling the reference guided wave at each meta-atom position.\n\n[0184] In one example, the momentum of the n=\u20141 space harmonic along the x direction is k,=\u20ac,,,-2n/A, which matches that of the free space providing that \u20141<k/&,<1. The corresponding output angle of the n=\u2014-1 space harmonic\n\nis\n\n6, = sin af oo \u201420/A & Sf\n\nFurthermore, to suppress the higher-order harmonic fre- quencies, the applied time delays and the time sequence randomized while the equivalent sinusoidal modulation the meta-atoms is maintained (FIG. 29). Since the momen- tums of the higher-order harmonic frequencies do not match with that of the free space and waveguide, the undesired higher-order harmonic frequencies (m#0) are significantly\n\nis\n\nto\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al", "type": "Document"}}
