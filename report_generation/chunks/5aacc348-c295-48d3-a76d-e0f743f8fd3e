To this purpose, an atomic crystal layer of ReS, (Le., single-layer of ReS,) is first formed on a substrate via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a reaction chamber (e.g., a tube furnace), and then the substrate is exposed to ultraviolet light at conditions suitable for forming a controlled wrinkle pattern structure.\n\n[0042] Reference is made to FIG. 1A, which is schematic diagram of a tube furnace 100 suitable for implementing the present method. The tube furnace 100 includes in its struc- ture, at least, a tubular body 110; and first and second containers 120a, 1206 independently for housing reactants necessary for the formation of single-layer of ReS,, includ- ing but is not limited to, the rhenium source, and the sulfur source. Further, the first and second containers 120a, 1205 are disposed within the tubular body 110, with the first container 120a being upstream to the second container 1205. The tubular body 110 has first and second temperature zones 1304, 1305, in which each temperature zone may be set at same or different temperatures. Note that in the present disclosure, each temperature zone refers to a certain section of the tubular body 110 coupled to at least, a heater and a temperature sensor (not visible from FIG. 1A), to bring the temperature of that certain section of the tubular body 110 to any pre-designated value during deposition of ReS,.", "type": "Document"}}
