Typically, the drug compound is first dissolved in the organic solvent, and the organic solution is dropped into water. Molecules of the drug will aggregate and precipitate as tiny nanoparticles in the water. However, several obvious weaknesses in re-precipitation method restrict its wide appli- cation, such as very low production rate and large batch-to- batch differences.\n\n[0006] To improve production rate or nanodrugs, it has been proposed to precipitate hydrophobic drugs inside tiny pores formed in ice. This is generally known as the ice- template method. An ice template is ice formed of deionized water at minus 20 degrees Celsius. The method involves dripping multiple drops of a hydrophobic solution of a drug onto the surface of such a piece of ice, and letting the solution infuse tiny pores in the ice. Subsequently, ventila- tion is provided to the surface of the ice to evaporate the solvent, leaving behind the hydrophobic solute to precipitate in situ the pores. The tiny size of the pores restricts the solute from precipitating into particles any larger, thereby limiting the particle size of the resultant nanodrug. Subsequently, the ice is liquefied by melting and the nanoparticles collected by filtration.", "type": "Document"}}
