In an ex- emplary embodiment, the support member can be pro- vided to extend along the posterior side of the spine. In another exemplary embodiment, the support member can be provided to extend along the anterior side of the spine. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of positioning the support member are also within the scope of the present invention. [0026] The support member can be mounted onto the spine in various manners. For example, the support member can be secured onto the spine by various se- curing elements, such as one or more bone fasteners. Examples of bone fasteners include, but not limited to, hooks, screws, wires, clamps, and the like. In an exem- plary embodiment, the supporting rod can have its free ends mounted onto the spine using various bone fasten- ers. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of mounting the support member are also within the scope of the present invention. [0027] The support member can be made of various materials. In one exemplary embodiment, the support member can comprise a superelastic or pseudoelastic material capable of providing a constant or substantially constant correction force. After such support member is subjected to deformation force, the deformed support member is capable of providing a constant or substan- tially constant force, which enables the deformed support member to return to its initial formation upon the release of the deformation force. The constant or substantially constant force so generated can be used to fully or sub- stantially fully correct various spinal deformities. In an exemplary embodiment, the support member can com- prise a NiTi alloy. It will be appreciated that other supere- lastic or pseudoelastic materials are also within the scope of the present invention. [0028] If desired, the magnitude of the correction force can be adjusted or varied in various manners. For exam- ple, the correction force can be varied by altering", "type": "Document"}}
