While notable progress has been made in the design and manufacturing of various hierarchical materials, the state-of-the-art approaches suffer from limited materials selection, high costs, as well as low processing throughput. Herein, by harnessing the configurable elastic crack engi- neering\u2014controlled formation and configuration of cracks in elastic materials\u2014an effect normally avoided in various industrial processes, the inventors report the development of a facile and powerful technique that enables the faithful transfer of arbitrary hierarchical structures with broad mate- rial compatibility and structural and functional integrity.\n\n[0010] In one embodiment of the present invention, replica material comprises a base material or an engineering material.\n\n[0011] In one embodiment of the present invention, the base material comprises silicon and a photoresist.\n\n[0012] In one embodiment of the present invention, the engineering material comprises a polymer or a printable material.", "type": "Document"}}
