A large number of LUT-FF pairs are inferred by the synthesizer in the form of slices to implement the distributed RAM-based TCAM designs. LUTs are needed by these design, but FFs are not.\n\n[0071] In one example embodiment, the electronic memory device may be further manipulated, by mapping data from a TCAM table into the electronic memory device including the plurality of basic memory blocks. Such map- ping includes: partitioning the TCAM table into a plurality of sub-tables; and mapping the plurality of sub-tables into corresponding basic memory blocks of the electronic memory device.\n\n[0063] However, due to the LUT-FF pair nature of FPGA, FFs are also inferred by the synthesizer while they are not part of the design. It is a waste of area on the reconfigurable device, i.e., FPGA. These FFs may be considered as redun- dant flip-flops.\n\n[0072] Preferably, data from a TCAM table may be mapped into D-TCAM which consists of D-CAM blocks. Mapping of TCAM data into the emulated TCAM may be referred as \u201cpopulating\u201d. In this populating operation, the plurality of sub-tables includes mxn sub-tables, wherein m equals to a number of sub-tables in a column and n equals to a number of sub-tables in a row, and wherein mxn equals to the number of basic memory blocks in the electronic memory device.", "type": "Document"}}
