The layers comprise the first substrate 702, p type semiconductor element 712, n type semiconductor element 714 and the second substrate 704. The thermoelectric module 710 gen- erates electricity when exposed to heat or a temperature difference due to the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect results in charge movement in the p type and n type semiconductor elements 712, 714 and results in an induced voltage. The induced voltage causes current to flow. A portion of the p type semiconductor element 712 is attached to a portion of the n type semiconductor element 714. The p type semiconductor element overlaps a portion of the n type semiconductor element in a region where the p type semiconductor element contacts and is attached to the n type semiconductor element.\n\n[0182] The sensor 700 as described herein can be used for fast switching applications with high sensitivity. The sensor 700 construction provides a sensor that has faster switching and higher sensitivity as compared to resistive or capacitive sensors. For example, the sensor 700 can be used for touch heat mapping or imaging applications. Alternatively, the sensor could be used as a touch sensor in other suitable applications. The sensor 700 as described is a thermal touch sensor. The sensor 700 is a standalone sensor without any externally applied voltage. The thermoelectric device 700 (i.e. sensor 700) as described is advantageous because it\n\n[0178] The thermoelectric device 700 functions as a touch sensor. The sensing region functions as a thermoelectric module since it comprises a p type semiconductor element adjacent a n type semiconductor element. The thermoelec- tric device 700 is configured to detect a touch from a person by detecting body heat from the touch and generating an electrical current in response.
