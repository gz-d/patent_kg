Thus, there exists a need in the art for an improved material that can be used as an implant in orthopedic and other medical appli- cations, as well as in other non-medical applications where a durable substitute for traditional metals or plastics is desired.\n\nSeveral different materials for implants have been used, including metal. Metallic implant materials are usually favorable in terms of toughness, ductility, and fatigue resis- tance. On the other hand, they are often stiffer than natural bone, resulting in stress shielding. The phenomenon of stress shielding is based on the effect that the implant material bears more of the mechanical load if it is stiffer than the surrounding tissue. This results in a \u201cshielding\u201d of the natural bone tissue from the mechanical load triggering the resorption processes of bone.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nbased on biodegradable polymers and surface-treated bio- degradable metallic materials, as well as fabrication meth- ods thereof. These novel hybrid materials are able to tackle the complications of conventional biodegradable materials (including magnesium-based materials), such as mis- matched bulk mechanical properties, poor biocompatibility, rapid degradation, and hydrogen gas release upon degrada- tion in orthopedic applications. In addition to the enhance- ment of biocompatibility, with the materials of the subjec- tion invention, the degradation process can be manipulated by controlling the chemistry of polymeric materials and the surface treatment of metallic materials as well as their ratio when forming the hybrid materials. The novel materials and. methods of the subject invention have several applications,", "type": "Document"}}
