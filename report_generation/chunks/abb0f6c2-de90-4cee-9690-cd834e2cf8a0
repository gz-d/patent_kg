The decoding module 332 is fol- lowed by a demodulator 333 and a signal receiving module 334. The wireless signal receive chain 330 is completed by a combined DRA and optical component module 3154. Again, one skilled in the art will understand the functionality and purpose of each of the modules comprising the wireless sig- nal receive chain 330. In the case of the combined DRA and optical component module 3154, the DRA acts as a signal radiator, ie. antenna, for the receive chain 330. The optical component may comprise a solar cell for generating power for the electronic system 300 ora lamp or LED for generating a light output signal for the system 300. Again, in the former case, the DRA comprises a DRA according to the invention as depicted by FIGS. 1 and 2 and, in the latter case, the DRA comprises a DRA according to the invention as depicted by FIG. 14 as hereinafter described. It will be appreciated that one of the combined modules 315a,b may comprise an optical component such as a solar cell for generating power for the electronic system 300 and the other may comprise a light generating means such as a lamp of an LED for said system", "type": "Document"}}
