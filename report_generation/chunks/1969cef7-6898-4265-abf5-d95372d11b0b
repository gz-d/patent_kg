FIG. 9 depicts a diagram of an example graph 900 of example gate-source voltage signals (Vgs) of the high- side portion switches (e.g., switches 202 and 204, which can be (VCSD) MOSFETs) (represented respectively as a pink- colored waveform and a green-colored waveform) of the SDSR and the input voltage (represented as a blue-colored waveform) in relation to a resistive load (e.g., when the sys- tem 200 is subject to a resistive load) in accordance with an aspect. In relation to the graph 900, FIG. 10 depicts a diagram of an example graph 1000 comprising corresponding gate- source voltage signals (V gs) for the low-side portion switches (e.g., switches 206 and 208 (CCSD) MOSFETs) (represented respectively as a pink-colored waveform and a first green- colored waveform) of the SDSR and the input current (rep- resented as a second green-colored waveform) obtained from the SDSR for the same resistive load. It can be seen from that the input voltage and input current waveforms of the conven- tional diode bridge fed with a resistive load in FIG. 8 are the same or at least substantially the same as the input voltage waveform (in FIG. 9) and input current waveform (in FIG. 10) obtained from the SDSR for the same resistive load.", "type": "Document"}}
