In further non-limiting implementa- tions, exemplary solar energy collection system 1800 can be adapted to power an associated communications antenna, for example, as described above regarding FIGS. 7-8. For example, solar energy collection system 1800 can comprise an antenna 1802 (e.g. GA 700, etc.) according to various aspects of the disclosed subject matter.\n\nFor instance, solar energy collection system 1800 can com- prise one or more solar cell(s) 1804 (e.g., one or more con- formal overlaid solar cell(s) 704, etc.) that can be fabricated on, positioned on, or otherwise located adjacent to and con- forming with a non-planar reflector structure (e.g., reflector 702 of GA 700, etc.). While, for purposes of illustration and not limitation, the reflector 702 is depicted and described as a parabolic reflector 702, it can be understood that the disclosed subject matter is not so limited. For instance, it is contem- plated that virtually any reflector structure (e.g., whether con- figured as a non-planar reflector structure, or otherwise, a parabolic reflector structure, a substantially parabolic reflec- tor structure, or otherwise, etc.) can function as reflector 702 to support one or more solar cell(s) 1804 adjacent to a reflec- tor structure.", "type": "Document"}}
