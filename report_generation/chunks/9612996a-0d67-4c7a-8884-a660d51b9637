A repeated measures ANOVA revealed there is no significant effect of the side of ear on the participants\u2019 response time. Also, there was no significant effect of the direction of temperature change on the response time, nor the pattern type. FIG. 12 illustrates the response time for different temperature-change directions and different sides of ear.\n\n[0099] Discussion of Study 2\n\nwere found with over\n\nSix same-ear spatial\n\n[0100]\n\npatterns 70% accuracy: 1h3h, 3h4h, 1e3c, 3c4c, S5h7h, 7h8h, 5c7c, and 7c8c. All these patterns involve the back location in the ThermEarhook prototype. This could be due to the thin skin at the back around the ear leading to a high thermal sensitivity, as existing psycho-physical research shows that the thickness of the skin is negatively correlated to the thermal sensitivity. In addition, half of these more accurate patterns involves the front location G.e., 1h3h, 1c3c, 5h7h, and 5c7c). This could be due to the high thermal sensitivity of the hairy skin in this area. However, as the thickness of the hairy layer increases at the top location of the Ther- mEarhook device, the thermal stimuli were mostly blocked by the hair, resulting in the lower accuracy (averagely 35.4%) for the patterns involving the stimuli in this area (1.e.\uff0c 1h2h, 2h3h, 2h4h, lc2c, 2c3c, and 2c4c on the left; S5h6h,\n\n6h7h, 6h8h, S5c6c, 6c7c, and 6c8c on the night).\n\n[0101] Study 3: Multi-Point Thermal Patterns With\n\nEars\n\nBoth\n\n[0102] Besides the spatial thermal patterns around one ear only, it is also possible to design the patterns by combining the spots on both ears. To this end, we conducted the third study to investigate how accurately and fast users may recognize the two-ears spatial thermal patterns as shown in FIG. 9c.\n\n[0103] Participants", "type": "Document"}}
