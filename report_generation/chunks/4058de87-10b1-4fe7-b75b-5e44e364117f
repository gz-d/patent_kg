Some embodiments of the invention may include one or more additional or alternative advantages not described or illus- trated. For example, some embodiments may provide a single metasurface device that can manipulate multiple (e.g., all) fundamental properties of EM waves (amplitude, phase, momentum, frequency, and polarization). For example, some embodiments alleviate or overcome one or more of these issues: (i) the functionalities of existing passive meta- surfaces cannot be altered once fabricated, (ii) existing tunable metasurfaces lack sufficient degrees of freedom in the element\u2019s geometrical parameters and lack external control variables that can support the regulation of all wave properties, and (iii) independent EM wave properties manipulations are challenging as the controls over these properties are generally coupled with each other. Some embodiments of the invention provide a metasurface antenna that can dynamically, simultaneously, indepen-\n\nUS 2024/0258717 Al\n\ndently, and/or precisely manipulate all the fundamental properties of EM waves, e.g., in a software-defined manner. Some embodiments of the invention realize complicated and complete waveform controls by simply switching the opera- tion states of the meta-atoms (radiating and non-radiating; ON and OFF) (e.g., 1 bit).\n\n[0204]\n\nIt will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art", "type": "Document"}}
