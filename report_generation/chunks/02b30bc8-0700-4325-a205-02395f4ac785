In the embodiment, a WLED lamp of electrical power 20 Watt is employed and its polar- ized beam is regarded as random. Both the common-path interferometric unit and the carrier frequency modulation unit are adopted. The thickness of the birefringent crystal of the common-path interferometric unit is made of yttrium ortho- vanadate (YVO4), which predetermined as 630 micrometers and optimized for the spectrometer employed. The SPR and the LRSPR configurations are provided respectively for com- parison purpose. The sensor layer structures are a thin gold layer with 48 nm thickness for the SPR configuration and a gold/silicon dioxide/gold multi-layer stack with thicknesses of 48 nm, 620 nm and 2 nm respectively for the LRSPR configuration. The results indicate that for a 1\u00b0 spectral phase change the corresponding refractive changes are 8.53x1077 for the SPR configuration and 1.95x10 MU for the LRSPR configuration. This means that the detection resolution of the LRSPR configuration is approximately 44 times higher than that of the SPR configuration. FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 show simulation results of the spectral phase response from the SPR and LRSPR configurations, respectively, when they are incorporated in the wide dynamic range phase-sensitive SPR sensor. The incident angles used in this simulation is fixed at about 73.5\u00b0, and the resultant signal traces are detected by a 3648-elements optical spectral analyzer covering 600 nm to 800 nm with approximately 0.05 nm interval for both SPR and LRSPR configurations.
