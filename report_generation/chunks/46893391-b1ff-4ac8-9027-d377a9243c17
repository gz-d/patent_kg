In accordance with various aspects, there can be, for example, three capacitors in each of the three high-side portion SDGD components 2114, 2116, and 2118, wherein SDGD compo- nent 2114 can include capacitors C,, C, and Cs for use in conjunction with switch 2102 (M,); SDGD component 2116 can include capacitors C,, Cs and Cu for use in conjunction with switch 2104 (M,),; and SDGD component 2118 can include capacitors C,, Cg and Ce for use in conjunction with switch 2106 (M;). Also, each of the three high-side portion SDGD components 2114, 2116, and 2118 can include three driving stages. Taking SDGD component 2114 and switch 2102 (M,) as an example, the transistors Q,, Q3, Qy, and Qs; switches M, and Ms; and transistors Qu and Q, can respec- tively form the three driving stages. The transistors Q, through Q; can be employed for signal amplifying and pro- viding charging paths for the SDGD component 2114, wherein resistor R, can be employed for use with transistor Q, and switch M., and wherein resistor Re can be employed for use with transistors Q, and Q,; the switches M, and Ms can form an inverter; and the transistors Q, and Q, can be employed for desirably fast driving of the power switch 2102 (M1), wherein resistor R; can be employed for use with transistors Q, and Q,, and power switch 2102 (M1).", "type": "Document"}}
