The system of claim 5, wherein at least one of the first high-side SDGD component, the at least one other high-side SDGD component, the first low-side SDGD component, or the at least one other low-side SDGD component, is further configured to receive at least a portion of the rectified power signal to facilitate operation of the at least one of the first high-side SDGD component, the at least one other high-side SDGD component, the first low-side SDGD component, or the at least one other low-side SDGD component.\n\n7. The system of claim 4, wherein at least one of the first high-side power switch or the at least one other high-side ower switch is respectively configured to be switched from an off state to an on state in response to reception ofa forward- iased voltage that satisfies an applicable defined gate thresh- old switching voltage level, wherein, with respect to the first high-side power switch, the first switch state is the off state and the second switch state is the on state; and at least one of the first low-side power switch or the at least one other low- side power switch is further configured to be switched from a respective on state to a respective off state in response to current in the at least one of the first low-side power switch or the at least one other low-side power switch being reversed.\n\nzero-crossing controller component configured to facili- tate supplying a defined positive voltage signal to a comparator of the SDGD subsystem to facilitate the control of a second power switch of the subset of power switches that is associated with the comparator to switch the second power switch from an on state to an off state at or substantially close to a zero-voltage-crossing point ata half-cycle of the input power signal associated with the second power switch.", "type": "Document"}}
