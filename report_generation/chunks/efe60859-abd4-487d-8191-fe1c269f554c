The term \u201coff-target sites\u201d as used herein refers to non- specific binding of the modified protein at locations other than the predetermined target sequence. The term \u201con-target sites\u201d used herein refers to binding of the modified protein at the predetermined target sequence. On-target and off- target site binding may be compared at various target sites, for example human endogenous sites. The target sites include, but are not limited to, EMX1_6, EMX1_1, EMX1_4, EMX1_10, VEGFA_8, FANCF_13, FANCF_10,\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE\n\nEMBODIMENTS\n\nUnless otherwise defined, all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one skilled in the art to which the invention belongs.\n\nAs used herein, \u201ccomprising\u201d means including the fol- lowing elements but not excluding others. \u201cEssentially con- sisting of\u2019 means that the material consists of the respective element along with usually and unavoidable impurities such as side products and components usually resulting from the respective preparation or method for obtaining the material such as traces of further components or solvents. \u201cConsist- ing of\u2019 means that the material solely consists of, i.e. is formed by the respective element. As used herein, the forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe,\u201d are intended to include the singular and plural forms unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.", "type": "Document"}}
