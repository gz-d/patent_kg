Hence, the pore surface assists infusion of the hydrophobic solution into the ice.\n\n[0038] Optionally, the ice, with the solution dropped onto the top surface of the ice, is then placed in a freezer at minus 20 degrees Celsius for 10 hours to let the solution continue to infuse into the ice pores. Keeping the ice template at a very low temperature prevents enlargement and amalgama- tion of the ice crystals, sustaining the tiny pores in the ice.\n\n[0039] Subsequently, the solvent is removed from the template by passing a flow of air or insert gas over the surface of the ice, at 207. This evaporates the solvent from ice template. As the solvent leaves the ice template, solute is forced to precipitate inside the pores in the ice.\n\nthe\n\nice\n\nthe\n\n[0040] Upon complete evaporation of the solvent, the drug-loaded ice is left to age for a further 24 hours at minus degrees Celsius, during which molecules of the drug further self-assemble into nano-sized particles, i.e. pure nanodrug or PND.\n\n20\n\n[0041] Finally, the pieces of ice are removed from wells 103 of the 24-well microplate 101, at 209. The removed drug-filled pieces of ice are simply melted, at 211, in a bath of deionised water to yield a colloidal suspension of the nanodrug 213. Preferably, sonication is applied for 10 to 30 minutes as the ice melts to assist dispersion of the nanodrug 213 in the colloidal suspension. The nanodrug 213 can be recovered by a vacuum filtration system. Alternatively, instead of melting the ice, the nanodrug 213 is separated. from the ice by freeze-drying (not illustrated) in vacuum, or sublimation, to yield a dry powder of the nanodrug 213 (not illustrated).", "type": "Document"}}
