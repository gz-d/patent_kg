In addition, KPlip- comp, of which the sequence is almost the same as KPlip but without the minimalist photo-crosslinker, is used as a com- peting probe.\n\n[0041] The fluorescent marker may be nitrobenzofurazan (NBD), for example an O-NBD.\n\n[0042] When lysine lipoylation occurs, it yields a lysine amine group. The intramolecular reaction that turns on the flourescence may be the intramolecular attack of a released. amine at the O-NBD, yielding N-NBD.\n\n[0052] All of the probes can be utilized to perform binding and pull-down experiments in living cells and cell lysates. The experimental results indicate that the proteins bound to KPlip-C are non-specific binders. By removing those pro- teins from the KPlip-binding list, a probe-selectivity list is obtained. In a parallel set of binding and pull-down experi- ments, KPlip is utilized in the absence or presence of KPlip-comp.
