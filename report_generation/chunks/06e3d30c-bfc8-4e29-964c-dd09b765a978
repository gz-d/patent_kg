In another aspect, the switch 202 and switch 204 can be VCSD switches (e.g., n-type enhancement power MOSFETs) that each can be turned to the on state when such switch is for- ward-biased, and the switch 206 and switch 208 can be CCSD switches that each can be respectively controlled by sensing the current through such switch and can be turned or switched to the off state whenever the current sensed across such switch reversed. While switch 202 and switch 204 are VCSD switches in the above embodiment, it is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with other embodiments, the switches 202 and/or 204 also can be CCSD switches, instead of VCSD switches.\n\nIn another aspect, the SDGD components 212, 214, 216, and 218 each can respectively be and/or can comprise low power components, as compared to the switches 202 through 208, which can be power devices. In an embodiment, the SDGD components 212, 214, 216, and 218, or a desired portion thereof, can be formed as an integrated circuit. In still another aspect, the SDGD component 212 and SDGD com- ponent 214 can be included in a high-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, and SDGD component 216 and SDGD component 218 can be included in a low-side portion of the SDGD subsystem, wherein the high-side portion and low- side portion can be symmetrical. In yet another aspect, the circuitry of the SDGD component 216 and SDGD component 218 can be grounded with the power circuits (e.g., circuitry associated with the power switches) and the power supplies for the SDGD component 216 and SDGD component 218 can be derived (e.g., obtained) from the output DC voltage from the synchronous rectifier of 200.", "type": "Document"}}
