The maximum peak voltage up ~1/0 V appears when the ion concentration is increased to 10\u00b0 mol/L, beyond which the output voltage decays. This is because, at high concentrations, ions In the bulk water might screen EDL, which prevents their directional flow to the virtual source or drain surfaces. Please see Embodiments made of PTFE in accordance with the present invention also exhibits relatively good stability owing to the strong charge and wetting stability of PTFE. Please see Fig. 10. charge stability is also strengthened by the continuous droplet impinging, which can provide charges to PTFE and thus preserve superior Stability. Thus, in coupled with serving as the energy source and the gate-like channel as discussed above, the water droplet manifests triple functions. control devices made of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Polypropylene (PP) as the virtual source, the performances decay rapidly due to the poor charge stability on these surfaces, although their initial power outputs are comparable with that on the TIDE-G made of PTFE.
