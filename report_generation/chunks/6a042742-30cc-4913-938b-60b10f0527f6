The device includes an earhook shell 10 config- ured to be worm on a user\u2019s outer ear. The earhook shell includes plural thermoelectric modules 20 for providing hot and/or cold stimuli at multiple points on an auricular skin area of the user\u2019s outer ear. A wireless receiver 30 is provided for recetving communication signals from a com- puting device (not shown in FIG. 1A). A mobile phone, a personal computer (PC), or a mainframe computer may provide communication signals to notify the user of infor- mation such as directions supplied from a navigation pro- gram where the thermal stimuli tell the user to turn right or\n\nis\n\nleft, for example,\n\n[0050] A power supply 40 is in electrical communication with the thermoelectric modules 20 and the wireless receiver 30. The power supply may be a single use battery or rechargeable battery and may include connectors for exter- nal recharging; alternatively, the rechargeable battery may be recharged through wireless recharging. The wireless receiver may be the wireless receiver may be one or more of NEC, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi modules.\n\n[0051] Acontroller 50 may be provided that is in electrical communication with the power supply and the plurality of thermoelectric modules for controlling a temperature and duration of the hot and cold stimuli. Each of the thermo- electric modules may be individually controlled by the controller; two or more of the thermoelectric modules may be controlled together to create different thermal patterns.\n\n[0052] The wearable device can additionally include one or more of a biosensor, microphone, bone conduction speaker, GPS module, accelerometer, or gyroscope. As seen in FIG. 1A, a thermally conductive heat, sink layer 15 may be used to mount the thermoelectric modules. The power\n\nApr. 20, 2023", "type": "Document"}}
