Accidents related to batteries and battery systems can occur reasonably frequently. For example, Lithium ion batteries are easily prone to explo- sions at high temperatures or due to physical damage. Several current portable power sources also require constant recharging. There is a need for an improved power source.\n\n[0017] In one configuration the n type semiconductor ement the p type semiconductor element generating a flow electric current in response to heat or temperature gradi- applied to the device and the electric current flowing through the conductor member.\n\n[0018] In one configuration the p type semiconductor element comprises Tin Telluride (SnTe) or Bismuth Anti- mony Telluride (Bi, ;Sb, ;Te;) , and the n type semicon- ductor element comprises Lead Telluride (PbTe) or Bismuth Telluride(Bi,Te;).\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0004] The present disclosure relates to a thermoelectric device that converts applied heat ie. thermal energy to electricity. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a wearable thermoelectric device that can be worn by a user and generates electricity when exposed to body heat ie. a temperature difference caused by body heat. The thermo- electric device described herein induces a voltage and a current flow when exposed to a heat source.\n\n[0019] In one configuration the n type semiconductor element and the p type semiconductor element are elongate legs, each leg comprises a longitudinal axis that is longer than a transverse axis of the leg.\n\n[0020] In one configuration the n type semiconductor leg and the p type semiconductor leg being arranged adjacent and parallel to each other.", "type": "Document"}}
