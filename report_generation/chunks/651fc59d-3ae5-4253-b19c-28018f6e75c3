The method comprises feeding a gaseous or vaporized. implantation material to an implantation chamber through a feed conduit, and supporting a sample to be implanted on a sample holder, the feed conduit having an end that opens into the implantation chamber to form a feed conduit exit opening, the end and the feed conduit exit opening formed by the end defining a feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, and. the sample holder defining a sample holder cross-sectional area situated opposite from the feed conduit exit opening cross-sectional area, the feed conduit exit opening cross- sectional area being smaller than the sample holder cross sectional area. The method further comprises generating a glow-discharge between the sample holder and the feed con- duit exit opening by applying a negative potential to the sample holder to generate a plasma from the gaseous or vaporized implantation material, whereby ions of the implan- tation material are generated and accelerated towards the sample.\n\nTo one side of the vacuum chamber 1 there is means for vaporizing a solid material 18. This vaporizing means comprises an evaporation chamber 17, a heating device 16 and a thermally insulating shield 15 designed to ensure that heat generated by the heating device 16 is directed into the evaporation chamber 17 for greater efficiency rather than externally of the evaporation chamber 17. At the top of the evaporation chamber 17 there is formed a neck 23 that connects the evaporation chamber 17 to the feed conduit 4 that leads through a side wall of the vacuum chamber 1 to the top of the implantation chamber 2 where the feed conduit 4 is formed with an exit opening 3 into the implantation chamber 2 located above the sample 5. provided a", "type": "Document"}}
