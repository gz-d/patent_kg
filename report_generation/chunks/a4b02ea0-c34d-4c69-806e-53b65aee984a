In this example TCAM design, 6-input may saves information of 1x6 TCAM in a similar way as described for 3-input LUTRAM of FIG. 3A. For example, a basic memory block including a D-CAM block may include 64 6-input LUTRAMs which implements a 64x6 TCAM. In addition, multiple basic memory blocks, i.e., the D-CAM blocks, may be connected together to form a modular structure of larger TCAMs similarly as described for mul- tiple 3-input LUTRAMs in cascade and/or parallel form, referring to FIG. 3E for example.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTerminologies (Notations for D-TCAM) Notation Definition Sk Search key (W bits) Ww Width of the D-TCAM D Depth of the D-TCAM m Number of D-CAM blocks in a column n Number of D-CAM blocks in a row MLs Match lines.

In one preferable embodiment, one D-CAM block consists of 64 6-input lookup tables (LUTs). These LUTs may be provided by the SLICEM slices of Xilinx FPGAs, which are also known as LUTRAMs.\n\n[0047] FPGAs consist of reconfigurable hardware compo- nents, to implement any digital system, supported by the interconnection matrix. With reference to FIG. 2, an exem- plary FPGA 200 may include block RAMs (BRAMs) 202, digital signal processing (DSP) blocks 204, configurable logic blocks (CLBs) 206, and input/output blocks (IOBs) 208.", "type": "Document"}}
