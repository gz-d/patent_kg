Because PAD needs to use multiple A-lines to calculate flow speed, the scanning mode is changed to acquiring multiple successive A-lines at each point. The photoacoustic probe was scanned along a dashed line 410 in FIG. 4A and the flow speed profile was measured using the two methods (existing photoacoustic Doppler method and the dual-pulse method of the present embodiment). 200 successive A-lines at each point were used to do autocorrelation for PAD calculation. In the dual-pulse method of the present embodiment, each pair of 545 nm and 532 nm photoacoustic data can be used. to calculate flow speed. For comparison, the dual-pulse flow result was averaged over all A-line pairs. Flow results calculated by the two methods are shown in FIGS. 4C and 4D. The two results were compared by fitting them to a linear regression model, as shown in FIG. 4E. The determi- nation coeflicient R? is 0.938, indicating that the flow results\n\nmeasured by the two methods match well. To further demonstrate the high speed of dual-pulse\n\n[0091] flowmetry, the mouse heartbeat in the artery was measured. The measurement spot is labeled with a star 420 in FIG. 4A. The maximum amplitudes of multiple successive A-lines was calculated and the blood flow speeds were determined. using equation (3). Fourier transformation was applied to the blood flow speeds at multiple A-lines. The frequency spec- trum shows a peak at ~4.6 Hz in FIG. 4F, which matches with the heartbeat rate of the mouse under anesthesia. The heart beating can also be visible in the time domain as shown in FIG. 4G. The data was averaged 100 times and then filtered with a 10-Hz lowpass filter. The heartbeat cycles become obvious in the measured blood flow speeds. This result shows the dual-pulse method is advantageous in A-line based flow imaging.", "type": "Document"}}
