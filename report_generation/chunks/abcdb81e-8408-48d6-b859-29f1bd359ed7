In particular, the monomeric units form a self-assembly polymer. The present invention also relates to a method of preparing a composition, and a method of killing or controlling the growth of microorgan- isms.\n\n[0010] In one embodiment, the cyclic group is a 6 mem- bered aryl group and R has a structure of Formula (IIa):\n\nFormula (Ia) Ry Ro aoe Rs Ry\n\nBACKGROUND OF INVENTION\n\n[0002] Compositions that are capable of directional and reversible intermolecular self-assembly are of great interest and can be effective candidates for antimicrobial coatings due to their superior biocompatibility and antimicrobial capability. These compositions can be endowed with addi- tional properties such as antimicrobial functions.\n\n[0011] in which:\n\n[0012] R, and R, are independently selected from the group consisting of (i) a linear or branched alky] group, optionally comprising a heteroatom: a linear or branched alkenyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; a linear or branched alkynyl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; (ii) a cycloalky. group optionally comprising a heteroatom; (iii) an aryl group, optionally comprising a heteroatom; and (iv) a heteroatom;", "type": "Document"}}
