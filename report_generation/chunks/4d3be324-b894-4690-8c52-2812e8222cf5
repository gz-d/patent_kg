FIG. 1a plots the variation of the output voltage measured from an individual impinging droplet as a function of the number of droplet impinging. The Q,,,,, and the output voltage increase gradu- ally with increasing of droplet impinging times, followed by reaching an eventual plateau with the charge and voltage stabilized at 50.2 nC and 143.5 V, respectively, after imping- ing of 1.6x10* times (see FIG. 1c). Furthermore, this charge- loading method is applicable to a wide range of thickness of PTFE film. Our result shows that the maximum transferred charges are comparable after water droplet impinging of same times (1.6x10*) with various thickness of PTFE film from 6.7 hm to 16.9 hm (see FIG. 44). It is noted that the voltage linearly increases with thickness of PIFE film, which agree well with the tendency predicting by the circuit", "type": "Document"}}
