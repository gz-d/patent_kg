The method of the second aspect includes:\n\n[0037] implanting an assembly of the wirelessly-con- trolled electrostimulation module and microneedle- based drug delivery module onto a tissue surface of the target site at where the microprotrusions of the microneedle-based drug delivery module are at least\n\nJan, 25, 2024\n\npartially inserted into the tissues of the target site while the substrate of the microneedle-based drug delivery module is in contact with the remaining tissue surface which is a contact surface between the tissues and the substrate of the microneedle-based drug delivery mod- ule excluding holes or slots formed during the insertion of the microprotrusions of the microneedle-based drug delivery module;\n\n[0038] closing a wound on the skin of the recipient incised during the implantation of the implantable microneedle-based electrostimulation system;", "type": "Document"}}
