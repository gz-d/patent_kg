In the following description, like numerals those already employed to describe the first example of voltage regulator of FIG. 2 will be used to denote like parts.\n\nTeomp is proportional to I,\n\nAs depicted in FIG. 5, at an input to an output signal summing point 130 of the voltage regulator 110 (i.e. absent any compensation from the compensator circuit 122) there is provided an output voltage signal of v,,. The voltage com- pensator circuit 122 provides a compensating voltage signal of:\n\nIt will be understood by one skilled in the art that, although compensation signal I.,,,,,, is described as being provided a linear-type current source, any suitable current source can be utilized or, in some examples, a voltage source may be employed.\n\nVoor Yor)", "type": "Document"}}
