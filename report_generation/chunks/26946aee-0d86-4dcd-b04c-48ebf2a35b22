The magnetic bridge 480 contributes to enhancing the overall magnetic field strength and gradient generation, thereby facilitating manipulation of actuation subject.\n\n[0067] FIG. 5 illustrates four electromagnetic devices 502, 504, 506, and 508 according to certain embodiments of the present invention. Each electromagnetic device, for example, can be a specific implementation of electromag- netic device 102, 104, 200, 300, 402, or 404 as stated above with reference to one or more figures.\n\n[0068] As illustrated, the electromagnetic devices 502, 504, 506, and 508 define and surround a workspace 50. The electromagnetic devices 502, 504 are connected via a mag- netic bridge 580a, while the electromagnetic devices 506, 508 are connected via a magnetic bridge 5805.\n\n[0069] FIGS. 6A-6C illustrate an electromagnetic actua- tion system 600 including a plurality of electromagnetic devices. Each can be, for example, a specific implementation one or more electromagnetic devices as stated above with reference to one or more figures.\n\nof\n\n[0070] The number of electromagnetic devices as shown is for illustrating purpose only. Other number of electromag- netic devices is possible according to practical needs. The electromagnetic devices are housed within a casing or housing 690. The casing 690 may be made of proper materials, such as ABS engineering plastics.\n\nBy way of example, the magnetic core of of the electromagnetic devices can be linearly\n\n[0071]\n\nmore\n\none or adjusted\n\nUS 2024/0145145 Al\n\nMay 2, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
