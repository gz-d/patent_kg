The first substrate layer is arranged between the dielectric resonator element and the second substrate layer. The substrate assembly may include additional layers attached to the first and second substrate layers.\n\nDIELECTRIC RESONATOR ANTENNA\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n[0001] The invention relates to a dielectric resonator antenna, in particular, a dielectric resonator antenna that can provide different linearly-polarized omnidirectional radia- tion patterns.\n\n[0012] The first substrate layer and the second substrate layer may have the same cross section, thickness, or size. first substrate layer and the second substrate layer may have the same dielectric constant.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] In field of telecommunications, the use of antennas (single or multiple) to transmit/receive/transceive signals known as antenna diversity. Antenna diversity can improve wireless communication links by mitigating multipath effect deep fading effect, and improving channel capacity.\n\n[0013] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the feeding network is arranged between the first substrate layer and dielectric resonator element.\n\n[0014] In one embodiment of the first aspect, the substrate assembly further includes a ground plane arranged between. the first and second substrate layers and being operably connected with the feeding network.\n\n[0003] Various types of antenna diversity have been pro- posed. Examples of these include spatial diversity and polarization diversity.", "type": "Document"}}
