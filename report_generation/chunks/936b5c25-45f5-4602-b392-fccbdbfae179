Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the detector DD is electrically coupled. to the circuit board CB through the conductive wires CW. The circuit board CB includes a processor P, a memory M coupled to the processor P and a signal generator SG. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the detector DD includes a ring body 112, a receiving electrode layer 114, a transmitting electrode layer 116, a ground electrode layer 118, a strap S, a plurality of separated conductive electrode portions CP1, a conductive electrode portion CP2, a plurality of enameled wires EW, and a plurality of magnetic elements MM1, MM2. The aforesaid elements and the arrangement therebe- tween will be described follows.\n\nfully\n\nas\n\nReferring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the ring body 112 includes a top insulating layer 112a, an intermediate insulating layer 112, and a bottom insulating layer 112c. The intermediate insulating layer 1126 is disposed in between the top and the bottom insulating layers 112a@, 1126. The intermediate insu- lating layer 112c is conformally stacked on the bottom insulating layer 112b. The top insulating layer 112a is conformally stacked on the intermediate insulating layer 112c.", "type": "Document"}}
