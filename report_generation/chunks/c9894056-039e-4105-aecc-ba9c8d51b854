It can be observed that edge maps generated by thresholds from 0.1 to 0.5 are more consistent to this flicking area for sequence \u201cBal- loons\u201d, where strong edges of balloons and ribbons inside the rectangles are detected and less edges of plants and the man outside the rectangles are detected. In this case, thresh- olds among range 0.1 to 0.5 seem suitable for sequence \u201cBalloons\u201d. Similar result for \u201cLovebirds\u201d. For \u201cUndodancer\u201d, the flicker mainly concentrates on the upper body of the dancer and the rightmost and foremost pillar, so thresholds among range 0.07 to 0.2 are feasible.
