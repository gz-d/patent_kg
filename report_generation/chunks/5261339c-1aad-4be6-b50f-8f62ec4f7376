The microscope is connected with a camera, either analog or digital, connected. to a recording device, such as a VCR recorder, digital video camera or personal computer with video frame grabber. Video recorded in medium, e.g. VCR tape or mini DV tape, or recorded in personal computer is converted back to readable format, such as AVI or WMV format, and stored in personal computer for further video image analysis. The length of video for each teleost sample should not be less than 20 seconds.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 Schematic diagram of imaging system.\n\nalgorithm implemented in a home-made software. In the algorithm, a video frame is grabbed from the video file stored in personal computer, either in AVI or WMV format and immediately subtracted with its consecutive video frame. The subtraction is performed in pixel intensity value in pixel-by-pixel manner. Any movement that occurred between two consecutive video frames will lead to a differ- ence in the pixel intensity. Thus, subtraction will reveal moving blood cells in the video. A sample subtraction result is shown in FIG, 2. Since the time interval between each video frame is constant and the amount of differential pixels is related to the distance traveled by the blood cells between two video frames, the amount of differential pixels can be used to estimate the speed of blood cells. Plotting the amount of differential pixels, i.e. pixels with different pixel intensity to the corresponding pixel in the consecutive video frame, against time in seconds exhibits a wave-form curve with regular oscillation (FIG. 3), suggesting the oscillation\n\nFIG. 2 Example of image subtraction result.\n\nFIG. 3 Plot of differential pixels for the duration of 4 seconds.", "type": "Document"}}
