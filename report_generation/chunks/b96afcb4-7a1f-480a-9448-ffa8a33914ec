The co-clustering formulation ensures that the subject groups are consistent across all stimuli. The result is a grouping of subject and their representative HMMs for each stimulus (FIGURE 2). The similarity between an individual\u2019s eye movement patterns across stimuli and the representative HMMs are quantitatively assessed using log-likelihood measures as in the existing approach. The results are used to examine the relationship between eye movement patterns and other cognitive measures. Using this method, individual differences in eye movement patterns during scene viewing were examined and it was determined (1) what types of scene images (animals in nature vs. vehicles in a city) induce larger individual differences in eye movement patterns, and (2) how eye movement patterns during scene viewing are associated with subsequent foreground\n\nobject recognition performance and cognitive abilities among subjects.\n\n25\n\n30\n\nIn a study, 61 Asian participants (35 females) aged 18-25 (M = 20.77, SD = 1.70) were recruited from the University of Hong Kong. All participants had normal or corrected- to-normal vision. The materials viewed consisted of 150 scene images with animals in a natural environment and 150 scene images with vehicles in an urban environment. Images with different numbers of foreground objects, feature layouts, and locations of foreground objects were used to increase stimulus variability to provide adequate opportunities to elicit individual differences in eye movement pattern.", "type": "Document"}}
