According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the present Sn \u4e00 Bi \u4e00 In base solder particles are produced by,\n\ntin\n\nmixture\n\n[0045]\n\n(a) sintering a comprising (Sn), muth (Bi) and indium (In) to produce a bulk alloy having a melting point of about 60-65\u00b0 C.;\n\nbis-\n\n[0046]\n\nthe bulk\n\nof\n\n(b) dissolving alloy step (a) ethylene glycol solution containing polyvinylpyrroli- done (PVP) to produce an alloy solution;\n\nin\n\nan\n\n[0047] (c) ultrasonicating the alloy solution of step at a first temperature of about 65-85\u00b0 C. for 10 to minutes to produce a suspension; and\n\n(b) 150\n\n(d) cooling the suspension of step (cj to a temperature of about 0-25\u00b0 C. to produce the Sn \u4e00 base solder particles.\n\n[0048]\n\nIn\n\nsecond Bi \u4e00\n\n[0049] The Sn\u2014Bi\u2014In base solder particles of the present disclosure are characterized in having a homogenous sub- micron particle size, specifically, each particle is less than 10 hm in diameter. To forming homogenous particles, a bulk alloy is ultrasonicated at a first temperature to form a suspension, which is subsequently cooled to a second tem- perature, thereby achieving uniform size distribution among the thus produced particles.", "type": "Document"}}
