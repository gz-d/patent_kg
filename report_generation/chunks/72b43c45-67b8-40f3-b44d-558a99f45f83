To this end, a shared aperture approach is developed to enable the universal metasurface antenna 400 to achieve such complicated wave and information manipulations (FIGS. 36 to 39). The measured far-field radiation patterns (FIG. 20) and the decoded constellation diagrams at the receiver (right inset of FIG. 20) verify that the universal metasurface antenna 400 can realize simulta- neous and independent multiplexing.", "type": "Document"}}
