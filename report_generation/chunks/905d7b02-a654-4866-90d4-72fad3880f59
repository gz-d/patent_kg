The Sirt2 enzyme was first incubated with either KPlip or a negative control probe, KPlip-C (lacking lipoylation), followed by 15 min of UV irradiation. Following click chemistry with rhodamine azide (Rh-N;), the reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analysed by in-gel fluorescence scanning. The results showed that Sirt2 was labelled by KPlip efficiently, whereas no labelling was observed in the control probe KPlip-C, indicating that Sirt2 interacted with the probe KPlip by specifically recognizing the Klip moiety. Time-dependent experiments showed that 2 min UV irradiation resulted in intense labelling. The fluorescence intensity of the labelled Sirt2 band increased when the concentrations of the probe increased, demonstrating that probe KPlip labelled the target protein in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\n[0080] The present invention employed a fluorescent probe based on an intramolecular reaction strategy to detect deacetylation activity. As such, a fluorogenic probe, KTlip, was prepared for profiling delipoylation activity in vitro. As shown in FIG. 5, the probe consisted of a recognition group, Klip, and an O-NBD moiety. Without being bound by theory it is believed that when enzymes hydrolyze the lipoyl group, the released amine will attack the O-NBD, yielding N-NBD, and turn on the fluorescence (FIG. 5). Such a probe may report the delipoylation activity of enzymes continuously and reliably.", "type": "Document"}}
