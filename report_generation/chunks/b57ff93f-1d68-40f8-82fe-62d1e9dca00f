The deep learning models 116 apply different models and parameters to achieve the best performance and output LVO patient\u2019s classification 120. The output LVO patient\u2019s classification 120 is provided a classification such as large-artery atherosclerosis, cardio embolism, small-vessel occlusion, and others (which are strokes of other determined\n\netiology and stokes of undermined etiology).\n\n[0044]\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates the data sources that by the stroke assessment system.

Among them, structured data can be integer numbers, float numbers, numbers in string format, or empty; textual data requires that the text language be English; image data requires that the data be CT scan images or MRI images of the brain. The data collected through the data collection process 206 is called medical data 104, or raw data. The raw data 301 in FIG. 3, the raw data 401 in FIG. 4, and the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine 501 in FIG. 5 are all part of the data collected by the data\n\n20\n\ncollection process 206.\n\n[0045]\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates the pre-processing pipeline of structured data used in the\n\n25\n\n30", "type": "Document"}}
