The corresponding control voltage can be applied to the barrier component to facilitate selecting the corresponding barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pattern to utilize in processing the received visual image to present the processed visual image in accordance with the selected. display mode. For instance, when the video content is normal 2-D content, the barrier pattern mode selected can be a trans- parent barrier pattern that passes through the received 2-D video content without further processing to facilitate display- ing the normal 2-D content without the blurriness that is otherwise typically encountered in conventional display sys- tems using an active barrier. When the video content is enhanced 2-D content (e.g., 2-D content comprising a plural- ity of 2-D images that represent respective portions of a 3-D scene or image), the barrier pattern mode and/or barrier pat- tern selected in response to the control signal can be one of a plurality of partially opaque 3-D barrier patterns (e.g., 3-D stereoscopic barrier pattern, 3-D autostereoscopic barrier pat- tern, etc.) that can receive the enhanced 2-D content and can convert the enhanced 2-D content to produce video content that reconstructs the 3-D scene (also referred to herein as the 3-D object scene), and that produced video content can be presented to a viewer via the projector screen component as", "type": "Document"}}
