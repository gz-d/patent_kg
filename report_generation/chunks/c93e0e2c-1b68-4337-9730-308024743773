The present invention found that SNF2L is used as XIST RBP, indicating that ISWI family proteins may promote XCI through their known function of regulating the higher-order structure of chromatin. The binding of TAF15 and XIST indicates that XIST RNA can repel TAF15 and possibly other transcrip- tional activators from binding to the promoter of Xi-linked. genes, thereby preventing the expression of target genes. This phenomenon supports a multitasking model that recruits inhibitors (such as SNF2L) and expulsion transcrip- tion activators (such as TAF15), and they may be the basis of XIST-mediated X chromosome inactivation (FIG. 9f).\n\nExample 3. Application of CARPID\n\nIn order to generalize the application of CARPID\n\n[0112]\n\nand extend its application to non-nuclear IncRNAs, the present invention designs a gRNA set with respect to two other IncRNAs DANCR (differentiation antagonistic non- protein coding RNA) and MALATI (lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 associated with metastasis). It is reported that DANCR transcripts mainly exist in the cytoplasm, and their overexpression is significantly related to the poor prognosis of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and osteosarcoma. However, the molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. It is important to note that the length of DANCR is 1000 nucleotides, which is much shorter than XIST. This and its low abundance in cells (FIG. 10a) make it technically challenging to conduct research using currently available methods (such as ChIRP- MS), which requires spanning dozens of different RNA\n\nprobes in order to sufficiently capture.", "type": "Document"}}
