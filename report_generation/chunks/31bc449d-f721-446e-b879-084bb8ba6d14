In contrast, when the electronic fabric was flipped and the water droplet contacted the superhydrophilic nanofibrous PAN layer, the water droplet was blocked and. spread over the superhydrophilic nanofibers without pen- etrating the hydrophobic PVDF nanofibers.\n\n[0011] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the conductive layer is coated on a side either hydrophobic nanofiber layer or the superhydrophilic nanofiber layer.\n\nthe\n\nof\n\n[0012] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the hydrophobic nanofiber layer and the super- hydrophilic nanofiber layer are electrospun nanofiber layers.\n\nUS 2024/0260899 Al\n\n[0013] In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, t the conductive layer is an electrosprayed conductive layer.\n\n[0014] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the hydrophobic nanofiber layer includes one or more high molecular weight hydrophobic polymers selected from polyvinylidene difluoride, copolymers of polyvi- nylidene difluoride, polyurethane, or polycaprolactone.\n\n[0015] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the superhydrophilic nanofiber layer includes one or more high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer selected from polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl alcohol, nylon or polyeth- ylene glycol.\n\n[0016] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the conductive coating layer includes an ultrafine and conductive functional material selected from one or more graphene oxide, titanium carbide, carbon nanotube, carbon black or acetylene black and a metal salt selected from lithium chloride or sodium chloride.\n\n[0017] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the size of the ultrafine and conductive functional material is 0.1 to 10 um.", "type": "Document"}}
