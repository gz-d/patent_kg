Note that the PTFE surface of TENG is prepared using the same method as in the case of TIDE-G. FIGS. 8a and 8b show the optical image of the as-fabricated droplet-based TENG as well as the schematic drawing of its basic working mechanism, respectively. Prior to the contact of droplet with the PTFE, the amount of charges on ITO (positive) is the same as that of the PTFE (negative) because of the electro- static induction. Thus, there is no current flow from ITO to ground (i). When a water droplet leaves the PIFE surface after impacting (ii), it becomes positively charged while the PTFE is more negatively charged as a result of contact electrification. Accordingly, a current flow between the ground and ITO electrode is induced (iv).
