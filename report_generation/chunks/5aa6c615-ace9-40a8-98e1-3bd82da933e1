In some embodiments, the array comprises, or consists only of, a plurality of subarrays each including some of the plurality of rows. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of subarrays is arranged to be subjected to a respective bias voltage. The bias voltage may affect one or more properties of the terahertz electromagnetic radiation provided by the radiator. The one or more properties of the terahertz electromagnetic radiation may include one or more of: radiation pattern, direction, etc. In some embodiments, the bias voltages applied to at least two of the plurality of subarrays are different. In some embodiments, the bias voltages applied to all of the plurality of subarrays are different.\n\n[0046] In some embodiments, the radiator is fabricated CMOS technologies, such as 65 nm CMOS process/ technology.\n\nusing\n\n[0047] In some embodiments, the radiator is arranged in, or formed in, an integrated circuit (chip). The terahertz electromagnetic radiation may radiate from one side (e.g., the front side) of the integrated circuit.\n\n[0048] In some embodiments, the radiator is a terahertz radiator configured for terahertz electromagnetic radiation only. In some embodiments, the radiator is configured for terahertz electromagnetic radiation as well as for electro- magnetic radiation at one or more other frequencies or frequency bands. In some embodiments in which the radia- tor is configured for providing terahertz electromagnetic radiation as well as electromagnetic radiation in one or more other frequencies or frequency bands, the radiator may operate best for providing terahertz electromagnetic radia- tion.\n\n[0049] Ina second aspect, there is provided an integrated circuit comprising at least one of the radiator of the first aspect.", "type": "Document"}}
