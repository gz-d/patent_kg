The patch element 404A may be differentially fed, ie., the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B may selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the patch element 404A.\n\n[0162] In this embodiment, the patch element 404B is electrically, in particularly capacitively, coupled with the transmission line connected to the drain terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) of the transistor arrangement 402A and with the transmission line connected to the drain terminal of another one of the transistors (e.g., the lower one in FIG. 4A) of the transistor arrangement 402B. The patch element 404B may be differ- entially fed, ie., the transistor arrangements 402A, 402B may selectively or alternately provide third harmonic power to the patch element 404B.\n\n[0163] As shown in FIG. 4A, in this embodiment, in plan view, the long axis of the transmission line of the coupler 402C (Le., a horizontal axis in FIG. 4A) may be an axis of reflection symmetry for the transmission line arrangements connected to the drain and/or source terminals of one of the transistors and the transmission line arrangements connected to the drain and/or source terminals of another one of the transistors in the same transistor arrangement.
