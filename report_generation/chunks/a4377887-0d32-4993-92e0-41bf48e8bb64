Briefly, a cracking coeflicient q W,na/W,, is defined to predict the location for the cracking ormation, where Wap is the smallest cross-section area of the neck region and h is the smallest cross-section area of the locked part. Similarly, to quantify the required maximum deformation of PDMS elastomer for complete release from the master, it is denoted a deformation coefficient Q=Wnin/ W,nax: Where W,,,,,, is the largest cross-sectional area near the locked region. To provide guidance on the design of proper master structures, a phase diagram showing the effect of geometric parameters on the crack formation behavior is mapped out (FIG. 2B). The CECE will fail under the ollowing two conditions. (1) when <100%, the neck region breaks before the occurrence of the desired cracking along the peeling force direction; (2) when 1/@<e (where e is the ultimate elongation of elastomer at break, e=250% for PDMS), the deformation of PDMS goes beyond its limit of the allowed elongation and as a result the mold cannot be\n\n[0115] The reopening of the elastic cracks is further simu- lated. A crack in the PDMS (Phase II) is pre-set in the bottom region of the closed loop. By increasing the neck length, PDMS is easier to be fully released from the daughter structure, as shown in FIG. 10.\n\n[0116] Replication Performance of CECE\n\n[0117] The repeatability of the present method was evalu- ated by fabricating multiple replicas using the same soft mold and checking the replicas with SEM. The replicas were identical with the original template (FIG. 11A-11D). There- fore, the lifetime of the soft mold was conservatively esti- mated to be 250 times.\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICATION", "type": "Document"}}
