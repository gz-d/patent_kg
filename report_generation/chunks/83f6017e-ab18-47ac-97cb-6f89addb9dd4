Pristine-NCMB811 417 x 10-3 PGE-NCM811 6.15 x 103\n\nModerate Structural Dynamics Upon Charge-Discharge Process of PGE-NCM811\n\n[0051] To elucidate the greatly enhanced performance of PGE-NCM81]1, in-situ synchrotron high-energy XRD mea- surement was performed on both pristine NCM811 and inventive PGE-NCMB811 cells during the first charge-dis- charge process. From the contour plots of pristine NCM811 (FIG. 11a), a reversible feature is observed for all the diffraction peaks, except for an abrupt break at around 3.7 V upon charging. Two typical groups of peak profiles, (003) and (101), are presented to detail this behavior (FIG. 114). Below 3.7 V, only one peak appears at the R-3m Bragg positions, which could be identified to the H1 phase. When the material is charged from 3.7 V to 3.8 V, new peaks emerge and become stronger, accompanied by a gradual fade of the H1 peaks. This result indicates the appearance of a new H2 phase and the structural transition from H1 to H2. Moreover, the line broadening of the XRD peaks also reveals a significant lattice strain in the H1-H2 coexisting region. Remarkably, for PGE-NCM811, no break is observed in the XRD contour plots (FIG. 12), and the (003) and (101) peaks also evolved smoothly without obvious line broadening (FIG. 11c). It may be speculated that the H1-H2 phase transition, which is a major concern for Ni-rich NCM materials, is completely inhibited in the inventive engi- neered material.", "type": "Document"}}
