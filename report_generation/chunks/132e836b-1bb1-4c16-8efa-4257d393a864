If the control signal has a low-level value representing a logical value \u201cQ\u201d, the switch 510 is controlled to be at an OFF (or open) state for blocking current.\n\nFIG. 1 shows how a regular implementation of photovol- taic (PV) system for transforming sunlight (depicted as wavy arrows) into electrical current (depicted as thick arrows). The PV system includes one or more PV modules 101 connected in series with a power processing device 102. The power processing device 102 can be any type of power inverter or converter, such as DC-DC inverter/converter.\n\n10\n\nThe control module 520 includes a memory 522 config- ured for receiving a parameter sensing signal V_Xsen car- rying sensed parameter data to be transmitted and recording the sensed parameter data. The sensed parameter data may be a sensed value of, for example but not limited to, temperature, electrical current, electrical voltage, or other parameters of interest.\n\nFIG. 2 shows an internal structure of the PV module 101 in normal operation. As shown in FIG. 2, the PV module 101 comprises one or more substrings A, B, each including a group of PV cells (or solar cells) connected in series with each other. Each of the substrings A, B is connected in parallel with a bypass diode D,, Dg. In normal operation (or in generative mode) and under illumination of sunlight, the PY cells are forward-biased and configured to absorb solar energy and generate electrical current. In this embodiment, the bypass diode D connected in parallel with substring A is partially conductive due to one of the PV cells in substring A is partially damaged.", "type": "Document"}}
