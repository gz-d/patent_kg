The most common metallic materials used in fracture fixation or total joint devices are medical-grade non-degrad- able metals, such as stainless steel, titanium, and cobalt- chromium-based alloys. Existing permanent metallic implants for fracture fixation and total hip replacement can often cause stress shielding effects due to the mismatch of the mechanical properties between these metallic implants and natural bone. That is, due to a mismatch of the mechani- cal properties between these metallic implants and natural bone, the major obstacle in using these non-degradable permanent metal implants is that they may cause stress shielding effects, thereby leading to bone loss around the implant. Patients who undergo orthopedic procedures such as fracture fixation, often undergo a second surgery after treatment is done in order to avoid this post-operative\n\nIn an embodiment, a hybrid material can comprise: biodegradable polymer; a surface-treated biodegradable metallic material; and a silane coupling agent chemically bonded to the surface-treated biodegradable metallic mate- rial and the biodegradable polymer.\n\nIn another embodiment, a method of fabricating a hybrid material comprising a biodegradable polymer and a biode- gradable metallic material can comprise: performing a sur- face treatment process on the biodegradable metallic mate- rial; dissolving the biodegradable polymer in an organic solvent to form a solution; adding the biodegradable metallic material, after the surface treatment process has been per- formed, to the solution; sonicating the solution; drying the solution to obtain a pre-hybrid material; and performing a heat treatment process on the pre-hybrid material.\n\nPolymeric implants are sometimes used as an alternative to metallic implants. However, existing polymeric implants often do not have appropriate mechanical strength to with- stand load-bearing conditions.", "type": "Document"}}
