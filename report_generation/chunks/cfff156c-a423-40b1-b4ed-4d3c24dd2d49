From the simulated result, the magnetic field intensity, at R=-O mm and Z=5 mm, is about 30 dBA/m. The measured magnetic intensity, in z-direction, is shown in FIG. 10. The white square and the white parallel lines in FIG. 10 indicate the positions of transformer and the current carrying leads of the transformer primary terminals, respectively. The output of the magnetic field transducer, at 5 mm beneath the centre of the transformer, is about 130 dBuV.", "type": "Document"}}
