SB shows GUIDE-Seq detected cleavage sites by a modified protein comprising mutations at E782, N968 and. R1015 positions (indicated as \u201cKKH\u201d in the figure) and a modified protein with mutations at E782, N968, R1015, R245, N413, N419 and R654 positions comprising an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 4 (KKH-SaCas9- HF, indicated as \u201cKKH-HF\u201d in the figure) when targeting six sites with canonical NNGRRT PAM. Read counts listed on the right represent the number of GUIDE-Seq reads. On- target site is indicated with \u201c*\u201d\u2019. Mismatched bases in off-target sites with the on-target site are highlighted.\n\nFIG. 2B is a bar graph showing the percentage of edited reads detected by GUIDE-seq at on-target site (green) and off-target sites (ordered by number of mismatches from 1 to 7) among total edited reads by VVT SaCas9 and SaCas9 modified proteins R245A, N413A, N419A and R654A at VEGFA_8.\n\nFIG. 2C is a bar graph showing the percentage of edited reads detected by GUIDE-seq at on-target site (green) and off-target sites (ordered by number of mismatches from 1 to 7) among total edited reads by VVT SaCas9 and SaCas9 modified proteins R245A, N413A, N419A and R654A at EMX1_1.\n\nFIG. 5C is a venn diagram comparing the number of off-target sites between a modified protein comprising muta- tions at E782, N968 and R1015 positions (indicated as \u201cKKH\u201d in the figure) and a modified protein with mutations at E782, N968, R1015, R245, N413, N419 and R654 posi- tions comprising an amino acid sequence as defined in SEQ ID NO: 4 (KKH-SaCas9-HF, indicated as \u201cKKH-HF\u201d in the figure) when targeting five sites including EMX1_1, EMX1_4, EMX1_10, FANCF_9 and FANCF_16 with non- canonical NNNRRT PAM.\n\nFIG. 2D shows genome-wide cleavage sites detected by GUIDE-Seq on EMX1_6, VEGFA_8 and EMX1_1. Read counts listed on the right represent the number of GUIDE- Seq reads; on-target site is indicated by \u201c*\u201d and mismatched bases in off-target sites with the on-target site are high- lighted.\n\nindels", "type": "Document"}}
