The chemical probe allows for the identification of\n\npotential regulators of lysine lipoylation , thus uncovering\n\nnew biology related to lipoylation .\n\n[ 0007 ]\n\nUntil now , no single - step fluorescent probe has\n\nbeen developed to report delipoylation activity . The present\n\nNEN\n\ninvention also provides a fluorogenic probe , KTlip , to detect\n\ndelipoylation activity in a continuous manner . The probe\n\nUS 2021/0395795 Al\n\nDec. 23, 2021\n\nenables a quick and reliable examination into whether protein possesses delipoylation activity.\n\nCOMPOUND AND A METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING A PROTEIN USING SAID COMPOUND\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n[0008] In a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound comprising a formula of R,\u2014X with X being a lysine-containing peptide substituted or unsubsti- tuted with a lipoyl group, and R, being a carbonyl having a photo-crosslinking group. The compound of the present invention may be referred to as KPlip.\n\n[0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/040,060 filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jun. 17, 2020 and entitled \u201cCOMPOUND AND A METHOD FOR IDEN- TIFYING A PROTEIN USING SAID COMPOUND,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.\n\n[0009] Preferably, the compound is a compound of for- mula of R,\u2014X, wherein X is a lysine-containing peptide with at least one (preferably 1) lysine within the peptide being substituted with a lipoyl group, and R, comprises a photo-crosslinking group attached to the lysine containing peptide via a carbonyl group.\n\n[0002] The present invention relates to compounds for use in detecting \u201creader\u201d and \u201ceraser\u201d proteins of lysine lipoy- lation. The present invention also pertains to a method of identifying a protein using said compounds.\n\nBACKGROUND", "type": "Document"}}
